"The Impact of Geopolitical Conflicts on Trade, Growth, and Innovation","Geopolitical conflicts have increasingly been a driver of trade policy. We
study the potential effects of global and persistent geopolitical conflicts on
trade, technological innovation, and economic growth. In conventional trade
models the welfare costs of such conflicts are modest. We build a multi-sector
multi-region general equilibrium model with dynamic sector-specific knowledge
diffusion, which magnifies welfare losses of trade conflicts. Idea diffusion is
mediated by the input-output structure of production, such that both sector
cost shares and import trade shares characterize the source distribution of
ideas. Using this framework, we explore the potential impact of a ""decoupling
of the global economy,"" a hypothetical scenario under which technology systems
would diverge in the global economy. We divide the global economy into two
geopolitical blocs -- East and West -- based on foreign policy similarity and
model decoupling through an increase in iceberg trade costs (full decoupling)
or tariffs (tariff decoupling). Results yield three main insights. First, the
projected welfare losses for the global economy of a decoupling scenario can be
drastic, as large as 15% in some regions and are largest in the lower income
regions as they would benefit less from technology spillovers from richer
areas. Second, the described size and pattern of welfare effects are specific
to the model with diffusion of ideas. Without diffusion of ideas the size and
variation across regions of the welfare losses would be substantially smaller.
Third, a multi-sector framework exacerbates diffusion inefficiencies induced by
trade costs relative to a single-sector one.",Carlos Góes; Eddy Bekkers,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12173v2,False,True,False,False,False,5.0,J Bradford Jensen,Boston,Completed,2004.0,https://doi.org/10.30875/25189808-2022-9,"Geopolitics, Welfare, International trade, Economics, Production (economics), International economics, General equilibrium theory, Distribution (mathematics), Diffusion, Business, Industrial organization, Economic system, Market economy, Microeconomics, Political science, Mathematical analysis, Physics, Mathematics, Politics, Law, Thermodynamics","UC San Diego Health System; University of California, San Diego; World Trade Organization","University of California San Diego; Trade Study Group (ETSG), Washington University at Saint Louis, UC San Diego, IBRE-FGV, Global; UC San Diego; World Trade Organization","University of California San Diego; Trade Study Group (ETSG), Washington University at Saint Louis, UC San Diego, IBRE-FGV, Global; UC San Diego; World Trade Organization"
"Quantifying the status of economies in international crop trade
  networks: An correlation structure analysis of various node-ranking metrics","International food trade is a growing complement to gaps in domestic food
supply and demand, but it is vulnerable to disruptions due to some unforeseen
shocks. This paper assembles the international crop trade networks using maize,
rice, soybean, and wheat trade data sets from 1986 to 2020. We assess the
importance of economies using multidimensional node importance metrics. We
analyze the correlation structure of different node important metrics based on
the random matrix theory and incorporate 20 metrics into a single metric. We
find that some metrics have many similarities and dissimilarities, especially
for metrics based on the same trade flow directions. We also find that European
economies have a significant impact on the iCTNs. Additionally, economies with
poor crop production play a major role in import trade, whereas economies with
higher food production or smaller populations are crucial to export trade. Our
findings have practical implications for identifying key economies in the
international crop trade networks, preventing severe damage to the food trade
system caused by trade disruptions in some economies, maintaining the stability
of the food supply, and ensuring food security.",Yin-Ting Zhang; Wei-Xing Zhou,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00669v2,False,True,False,False,False,5.0,J Bradford Jensen,Boston,Completed,2004.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2023.113567,"Food security, Ranking (information retrieval), International trade, Node (physics), Economics, Production (economics), Business, Economies of scale, Agriculture, Computer science, Ecology, Biology, Microeconomics, Engineering, Structural engineering, Machine learning",East China University of Science and Technology,"School of Business, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China; Research Center for Econophysics, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China; School of Mathematics, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China","School of Business, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China; Research Center for Econophysics, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China; School of Mathematics, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China"
"Barriers to Integration: Physical Boundaries and the Spatial Structure
  of Residential Segregation","Despite modest declines in residential segregation levels since the Civil
Rights Era, segregation remains a defining feature of the U.S. landscape. This
study highlights the importance of considering physical barriers--features of
the urban environment that disconnect locations--when measuring segregation. We
use population and geographic data for 20 U.S. Rustbelt cities from the 2010
decennial census and a novel approach for measuring and analyzing segregation
that incorporates the connectivity of roads and the excess distance imposed by
physical barriers, such as highways, railroad tracks, and dead-end streets. We
find that physical barriers divide urban space in ways that reinforce or
exacerbate segregation, but there is substantial variation in the extent to
which they increase segregation both within and across these cities and for
different ethnoracial groups. By uncovering a new source of variation in the
segregation experienced by city residents, the findings have implications for
understanding the mechanisms that contribute to the persistence of segregation
and the consequences of segregation.",Elizabeth Roberto; Jackelyn Hwang,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02574v3,False,True,False,False,True,9.0,Judith K Hellerstein,Washington,Completed,2005.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1509.02574,"Economic geography, Business, Geography",,,
A Machine Learning Approach to Improving Occupational Income Scores,"Historical studies of labor markets frequently lack data on individual
income. The occupational income score (OCCSCORE) is often used as an
alternative measure of labor market outcomes. We consider the consequences of
using OCCSCORE when researchers are interested in earnings regressions. We
estimate race and gender earnings gaps in modern decennial Censuses as well as
the 1915 Iowa State Census. Using OCCSCORE biases results towards zero and can
result in estimated gaps of the wrong sign. We use a machine learning approach
to construct a new adjusted score based on industry, occupation, and
demographics. The new income score provides estimates closer to earnings
regressions. Lastly, we consider the consequences for estimates of
intergenerational mobility elasticities.",Martin Saavedra; Tate Twinam,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08299v3,False,True,False,False,True,9.0,Judith K Hellerstein,Washington,Completed,2005.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eeh.2019.101304,"Earnings, Economics, Demographics, Census, Econometrics, Construct (python library), Demographic economics, Labour economics, Population, Demography, Finance, Sociology, Computer science, Programming language",Oberlin College; William & Mary,"Department of Economics, College of William & Mary, USA; Department of Economics, Oberlin College, USA","Department of Economics, College of William & Mary, USA; Department of Economics, Oberlin College, USA"

released under zero-concentrated differential privacy, focusing on settings
with a strong hierarchical structure and categorical variables with many

various amounts of prior information and examining the distance between their
posteriors and priors. We discuss applications of these risk assessment methods
to differentially private data releases from the 2020 decennial census and
perform simulation studies using public individual-level data from the 1940

Being at the core: firm product specialisation,"We propose a novel measure to investigate firms' product specialisation:
product coreness, that captures the centrality of exported products within the
firm's export basket. We study product coreness using firm-product level data
between 2018 and 2020 for Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Three main findings
emerge from our analysis. First, the composition of firms' export baskets
changes relatively little from one year to the other, and products far from the
firm's core competencies, with low coreness, are more likely to be dropped.
Second, higher coreness is associated with larger export flows at the firm
level. Third, such firm-level patterns also have implications at the aggregate
level: products that are, on average, exported with higher coreness have higher
export flows at the country level, which holds across all levels of product
complexity. Therefore, the paper shows that how closely a product fits within a
firm's capabilities is important for economic performance at both the firm and
country level. We explore these issues within an econometric framework, finding
robust evidence both across our three countries and for each country
separately.",Filippo Bontadini; Mercedes Campi; Marco Dueñas,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02767v2,False,True,False,False,False,11.0,Pinar Celikkol Geylani,CMU,Completed,2001.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2302.02767,"Product (mathematics), Centrality, Core (optical fiber), Business, Industrial organization, Econometric analysis, Core competency, Aggregate (composite), New product development, Economics, Marketing, Econometrics, Computer science, Telecommunications, Materials science, Geometry, Mathematics, Combinatorics, Composite material",,,
Audit fees in auditor switching,"The auditor work is examining that a company's financial statements
faithfully reflect its financial situation. His wage, the audit fees, are not
fixed among all companies, but can be affected by the financial and structural
characteristics of the company, as well as the characteristics of the firm he
belongs to. Another factor that may affect his wage in an auditor switching,
which can be resulted from changes in the company that may influence the fees.
This paper examines the effect nature of the auditor switching on his wage, and
the factors of the company characteristics and the economy data which determine
the wage at switching. A product of the research are tools for predicting and
evaluating the auditor wage at switching. These tools are important for the
auditor himself, but also for the company manager to correctly determine the
wage due to the possibility that the quality of the audit work depends on its
fees. Two main results are obtained. First, the direction of the wage change in
the switching year depends on the economic stability of the economy. Second,
the switching effect on the direction and the change size in wage depends on
the change size in the company characteristics before and after switching - a
large change versus a stable one. We get that forecasting the change size in
wage for companies with a larger change is their characteristics is paralleled
to forecasting a wage increasing. And vice versa, forecasting the change size
in wage for companies with a stable change in their characteristics is
paralleled to forecasting a wage decreasing. But, whereas the former can be
achieved based on the company characteristics and macroeconomics factors, the
predictably of these characteristics and factors is negligible for the letter.",Sarit Agami,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08250v1,False,True,False,False,False,18.0,Edith A Wiarda,Michigan,Completed,2006.0,https://doi.org/10.17509/jaset.v11i2.17922,"Business, Business administration, Stock exchange, Leverage (statistics), Nonprobability sampling, Audit, Accounting, Population, Statistics, Finance, Mathematics, Demography, Sociology",Telkom University,Telkom University,Telkom University
"A duopoly preemption game with two alternative stochastic investment
  choices","This paper studies a duopoly investment model with uncertainty. There are two
alternative irreversible investments. The first firm to invest gets a monopoly
benefit for a specified period of time. The second firm to invest gets
information based on what happens with the first investor, as well as cost
reduction benefits. We describe the payoff functions for both the leader and
follower firm. Then, we present a stochastic control game where the firms can
choose when to invest, and hence influence whether they become the leader or
the follower. In order to solve this problem, we combine techniques from
optimal stopping and game theory. For a specific choice of parametres, we show
that no pure symmetric subgame perfect Nash equilibrium exists. However, an
asymmetric equilibrium is characterized. In this equilibrium, two disjoint
intervals of market demand level give rise to preemptive investment behavior of
the firms, while the firms otherwise are more reluctant to be the first mover.",Kristina Rognlien Dahl; Espen Stokkereit,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.11009v1,False,True,False,False,False,22.0,Chad Shirley,UCLA,Completed,2004.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13370-019-00674-3,"Duopoly, Preemption, Economics, Microeconomics, Subgame perfect equilibrium, Stochastic game, Investment (military), Cournot competition, Nash equilibrium, Mathematical economics, Monopoly, First-mover advantage, Subgame, Game theory, Repeated game, Equilibrium selection, Industrial organization, Computer science, Politics, Political science, Law, Operating system",University of Oslo,"Department of Mathematics, University of Oslo, Pb. 1053 Blindern, 0316, Oslo, Norway","Department of Mathematics, University of Oslo, Pb. 1053 Blindern, 0316, Oslo, Norway"
Online busy time scheduling with flexible jobs,"We present several competitive ratios for the online busy time scheduling
problem with flexible jobs. The busy time scheduling problem is a fundamental
scheduling problem motivated by energy efficiency with the goal of minimizing
the total time that machines with multiple processors are enabled. In the busy
time scheduling problem, an unbounded number of machines is given, where each
machine has $g$ processors. No more than $g$ jobs can be scheduled
simultaneously on each machine. A machine consumes energy whenever at least one
job is scheduled at any time on the machine. Scheduling a single job at some
time $t$ consumes the same amount of energy as scheduling $g$ jobs at time $t$.
In the online setting, jobs are revealed when they are released.
  We consider the cases where $g$ is unbounded and bounded. In this paper, we
revisit the bounds of the unbounded general setting from the literature and
tighten it significantly. We also consider agreeable jobs. For the bounded
setting, we show a tightened upper bound. Furthermore, we show the first
constant competitive ratio in the bounded setting that does not require

Emission impossible: Balancing Environmental Concerns and Inflation,"We provide a theoretical framework to examine how carbon pricing policies
influence inflation and to estimate the policy-driven impact on goods prices
from achieving net-zero emissions. Firms control emissions by adjusting
production, abating, or purchasing permits, and these strategies determine
emissions reductions that affect the consumer price index. We first examine an
emissions-regulated economy, solving the market equilibrium under any dynamic
allocation of allowances set by the regulator. Next, we analyze a regulator
balancing emission reduction and inflation targets, identifying the optimal
allocation when accounting for both environmental and inflationary concerns. By
adjusting penalties for deviations from these targets, we demonstrate how
regulatory priorities shape equilibrium outcomes. Under reasonable model
parameterisation, even when considerable emphasis is placed on maintaining
inflation at acceptable levels or grant lower priority to emissions reduction
targets, the costs associated with emission deviations still exceed any savings
from marginally lower inflation. Emission reduction goals should remain the
primary focus for policymakers.",René Aïd; Maria Arduca; Sara Biagini; Luca Taschini,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16953v1,False,True,False,False,False,28.0,Jhih-shyang Shih,Washington,Completed,2004.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5118227,"Inflation (cosmology), Environmental science, Economics, Natural resource economics, Physics, Theoretical physics",,,
"Product Differentiation and Geographical Expansion of Exports Network at
  Industry level","Industries can enter one country first, and then enter its neighbors'
markets. Firms in the industry can expand trade network through the export
behavior of other firms in the industry. If a firm is dependent on a few
foreign markets, the political risks of the markets will hurt the firm. The
frequent trade disputes reflect the importance of the choice of export
destinations. Although the market diversification strategy was proposed before,
most firms still focus on a few markets, and the paper shows reasons.In this
paper, we assume the entry cost of firms is not all sunk cost, and show 2 ways
that product heterogeneity impacts extensive margin of exports theoretically
and empirically. Firstly, the increase in product heterogeneity promotes the
increase in market power and profit, and more firms are able to pay the entry
cost. If more firms enter the market, the information of the market will be
known by other firms in the industry. Firms can adjust their behavior according
to other firms, so the information changes entry cost and is not sunk cost
completely. The information makes firms more likely to entry the market, and
enter the surrounding markets of existing markets of other firms in the
industry. When firms choose new markets, they tend to enter the markets with
few competitors first.Meanwhile, product heterogeneity will directly affect the
firms' network expansion, and the reduction of product heterogeneity will
increase the value of peer information. This makes firms more likely to entry
the market, and firms in the industry concentrate on the markets.",Xuejian Wang,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07008v1,False,True,False,False,False,36.0,Catherine Armington,Washington,Completed,2002.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2012.07008,"Sunk costs, Competitor analysis, Industrial organization, Business, Diversification (marketing strategy), Market power, Profit margin, Profit (economics), Product (mathematics), Product market, Economics, Market economy, Incentive, Microeconomics, Marketing, Geometry, Mathematics, Monopoly",,,
"Can ethnic tolerance curb self-reinforcing school segregation? A
  theoretical Agent Based Model","Schelling and Sakoda prominently proposed computational models suggesting
that strong ethnic residential segregation can be the unintended outcome of a
self-reinforcing dynamic driven by choices of individuals with rather tolerant
ethnic preferences. There are only few attempts to apply this view to school
choice, another important arena in which ethnic segregation occurs. In the
current paper, we explore with an agent-based theoretical model similar to
those proposed for residential segregation, how ethnic tolerance among parents
can affect the level of school segregation. More specifically, we ask whether
and under which conditions school segregation could be reduced if more parents
hold tolerant ethnic preferences. We move beyond earlier models of school
segregation in three ways. First, we model individual school choices using a
random utility discrete choice approach. Second, we vary the pattern of ethnic
segregation in the residential context of school choices systematically,
comparing residential maps in which segregation is unrelated to parents' level
of tolerance to residential maps reflecting their ethnic preferences. Thirdly,
we introduce heterogeneity in tolerance levels among parents belonging to the
same group. Our simulation experiments suggest that ethnic school segregation
can be a very robust phenomenon, occurring even when about half of the
population prefers mixed to segregated schools. However, we also identify a
sweet spot in the parameter space in which a larger proportion of tolerant
parents makes the biggest difference. This is the case when the preference for
nearby schools weighs heavily in parents' utility function and the residential
map is only moderately segregated. Further experiments are presented that
unravel the underlying mechanisms.",Lucas Sage; Andreas Flache,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13531v1,False,True,False,False,False,44.0,John Mark Ellis,UCLA,Completed,2004.0,https://doi.org/10.18564/jasss.4544,"Ethnic group, Agent-based model, Psychology, Social psychology, Sociology, Computer science, Artificial intelligence, Anthropology",Groupe d'Étude des Méthodes de l'Analyse Sociologique de la Sorbonne; University of Trento; University of Groningen; Sorbonne Université,"Sorbonne Université - GEMASS - University of Trento; Department of Sociology, ICS, University of Groningen","Sorbonne Université - GEMASS - University of Trento; Department of Sociology, ICS, University of Groningen"
Shifted Windows Transformers for Medical Image Quality Assessment,"To maintain a standard in a medical imaging study, images should have

"Balance, growth and diversity of financial markets","A financial market comprising of a certain number of distinct companies is
considered, and the following statement is proved: either a specific agent will
surely beat the whole market unconditionally in the long run, or (and this ""or""

Thus, absence of any ""free unbounded lunches relative to the total capital""
opportunities lead to the most dramatic failure of diversity in the market: one
company takes over all other until the end of time. In order to prove this, we
introduce the notion of perfectly balanced markets, which is an equilibrium
state in which the relative capitalization of each company is a martingale

"Atlas-X Equity Financing: Unlocking New Methods to Securely Obfuscate
  Axe Inventory Data Based on Differential Privacy","Banks publish daily a list of available securities/assets (axe list) to
selected clients to help them effectively locate Long (buy) or Short (sell)
trades at reduced financing rates. This reduces costs for the bank, as the list
aggregates the bank's internal firm inventory per asset for all clients of long
as well as short trades. However, this is somewhat problematic: (1) the bank's
inventory is revealed; (2) trades of clients who contribute to the aggregated
list, particularly those deemed large, are revealed to other clients. Clients
conducting sizable trades with the bank and possessing a portion of the
aggregated asset exceeding $50\%$ are considered to be concentrated clients.
This could potentially reveal a trading concentrated client's activity to their
competitors, thus providing an unfair advantage over the market.
  Atlas-X Axe Obfuscation, powered by new differential private methods, enables
a bank to obfuscate its published axe list on a daily basis while under
continual observation, thus maintaining an acceptable inventory Profit and Loss
(P&L) cost pertaining to the noisy obfuscated axe list while reducing the
clients' trading activity leakage. Our main differential private innovation is
a differential private aggregator for streams (time series data) of both
positive and negative integers under continual observation.
  For the last two years, Atlas-X system has been live in production across
three major regions-USA, Europe, and Asia-at J.P. Morgan, a major financial
institution, facilitating significant profitability. To our knowledge, it is
the first differential privacy solution to be deployed in the financial sector.

Register-based Census in Thailand: a Case Study in Chachoengsao Province,"The use of registers has been increasingly popular in the field of population
census because of its advantages over the traditional census. While the
traditional census requires a large amount of fieldwork and data collection,
the registered-based census can rely on pre-existing administrative data. As a
result, the register-based census can save both time and budget. Thailand
explored a use of the register-based census in 2020. In this paper, the authors
layout the methodology in an aspect of data preparation and integration as well
as analyze data quality of the register-based census compared with the
traditional census in Chachoengsao province, Thailand. In addition, we compared
conceptual frameworks that are commonly used for a register-based census in
several countries and the number of databases (a recent single database VS
multiple databases) used to construct the register-based census. We found that
using a conceptual framework that counts the number of populations based on the
main census variables on a single recent database is better than using a
framework that counts population who appears on many registers in term of
overcoverage and data distribution regarding to sex. This provides the evidence
of using one recent and complete database is sufficient for conducting the
register-based census. The authors end up with recommendations for conducing
the register-based census.",Nuttirudee Charoenruk; Narongrid Asavaroungpipop; Pannee Pattanapradit; Kittiya Ku-kiattikun; Chainarong Amornbunchornvej,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12543v1,False,True,False,False,False,69.0,Thomas H Pollak,Washington,Completed,2002.0,https://doi.org/10.3233/sji-230045,"Census, Register (sociolinguistics), Database, Population, Geography, American Community Survey, Computer science, Demography, Sociology, Linguistics, Philosophy",National Electronics and Computer Technology Center; Chulalongkorn University,"National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, Pathum Thani, Thailand; National Statistical Office, Bangkok, Thailand; Department of Statistics, Chulalongkorn Business School, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand","National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, Pathum Thani, Thailand; National Statistical Office, Bangkok, Thailand; Department of Statistics, Chulalongkorn Business School, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand"
"The Role of Direct Capital Cash Transfers Towards Poverty and Extreme
  Poverty Alleviation -- An Omega Risk Process","Trapping refers to the event when a household falls into the area of poverty.
Households that live or fall into the area of poverty are said to be in a
poverty trap, where a poverty trap is a state of poverty from which it is
difficult to escape without external help. Similarly, extreme poverty is
considered as the most severe type of poverty, in which households experience
severe deprivation of basic human needs. In this article, we consider an Omega
risk process with deterministic growth and a multiplicative jump (collapse)
structure to model the capital of a household. It is assumed that, when a
household's capital level is above a certain capital barrier level that
determines a household's eligibility for a capital cash transfer programme, its
capital grows exponentially. As soon as its capital falls below the capital
barrier level, the capital dynamics incorporate external support in the form of
direct transfers (capital cash transfers) provided by donors or governments.
Otherwise, once trapped, the capital grows only due to the capital cash
transfers. Under this model, we first derive closed-form expressions for the
trapping probability and then do the same for the probability of extreme
poverty, which only depends on the current value of the capital given by some
extreme poverty rate function. Numerical examples illustrate the role of
capital cash transfers on poverty and extreme poverty dynamics.",José Miguel Flores-Contró; Séverine Arnold,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06141v3,False,True,False,False,False,71.0,Enrico Moretti,UCLA,Completed,2002.0,https://doi.org/10.1080/03461238.2024.2321574,"Poverty, Omega, Cash transfers, Capital (architecture), Business, Process (computing), Cash, Extreme poverty, Economics, Development economics, Finance, Economic growth, Geography, Computer science, Physics, Archaeology, Quantum mechanics, Operating system",University of Lausanne,"Department of Actuarial Science, Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland","Department of Actuarial Science, Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"

language a speaker is using, and ideally this process would be automated. The
technique described in this paper, language identification for audio

to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to be used for language identification.
LIFAS requires minimal pre-processing on the audio signals as the spectrograms
are generated during each batch as they are input to the network during
training.
  LIFAS utilizes deep learning tools that are shown to be successful on image

"Hierarchical Additive Modeling of Nonlinear Association with Spatial
  Correlations-An Application to Relate Alcohol Outlet Density and Neighborhood
  Assault Rates","Previous studies have suggested a link between alcohol outlets and assaultive
violence. In this paper, we explore the effects of alcohol availability on
assault crimes at the census tract level over time. The statistical analysis is
challenged by several features of the data: (1) the effects of possible
covariates (for example, the alcohol outlet density of each census tract) on
the assaultive crime rates may be complex; (2) the covariates may be highly
correlated with each other; (3) there are a lot of missing inputs in the data;
and (4) spatial correlations exist in the outcome assaultive crime rates. We
propose a hierarchical additive model, where the nonlinear correlations and the
complex interaction effects are modeled using the multiple additive regression
trees (MART) and the spatial variances in the assaultive rates that cannot be
explained by the specified covariates are smoothed trough the Conditional
Autoregressive (CAR) model. We develop a two-stage algorithm that connect the
non-parametric trees with CAR to look for important variables covariates
associated with the assaultive crime rates, while taking account of the spatial
correlations among adjacent census tracts. The proposed methods are applied to

"Distributional Semantics Approach to Detect Intent in Twitter
  Conversations on Sexual Assaults","The recent surge in women reporting sexual assault and harassment (e.g.,
#metoo campaign) has highlighted a longstanding societal crisis. This injustice
is partly due to a culture of discrediting women who report such crimes and
also, rape myths (e.g., 'women lie about rape'). Social web can facilitate the
further proliferation of deceptive beliefs and culture of rape myths through
intentional messaging by malicious actors. This multidisciplinary study
investigates Twitter posts related to sexual assaults and rape myths for
characterizing the types of malicious intent, which leads to the beliefs on
discrediting women and rape myths. Specifically, we first propose a novel
malicious intent typology for social media using the guidance of social
construction theory from policy literature that includes Accusational,
Validational, or Sensational intent categories. We then present and evaluate a
malicious intent classification model for a Twitter post using semantic
features of the intent senses learned with the help of convolutional neural
networks. Lastly, we analyze a Twitter dataset of four months using the intent
classification model to study narrative contexts in which malicious intents are
expressed and discuss their implications for gender violence policy design.",Rahul Pandey; Hemant Purohit; Bonnie Stabile; Aubrey Grant,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01012v1,False,True,False,False,False,82.0,Jacqueline Cohen,CMU,Completed,2002.0,https://doi.org/10.1109/wi.2018.00-80,"Mythology, Harassment, Narrative, Typology, Social media, Computer security, Criminology, Psychology, Internet privacy, Computer science, Social psychology, Sociology, World Wide Web, Philosophy, Linguistics, Theology, Anthropology",George Mason University,"George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA","George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA"
Resilient Urban Housing Markets: Shocks vs. Fundamentals,"In the face of a pandemic, urban protests, and an affordability crisis, is
the desirability of dense urban settings at a turning point? Assessing cities'
long term trends remains challenging. The first part of this chapter describes
the short-run dynamics of the housing market in 2020. Evidence from prices and
price-to-rent ratios suggests expectations of resilience. Zip-level evidence
suggests a short-run trend towards suburbanization, and some impacts of urban
protests on house prices. The second part of the chapter analyzes the long-run
dynamics of urban growth between 1970 and 2010. It analyzes what, in such urban
growth, is explained by short-run shocks as opposed to fundamentals such as
education, industrial specialization, industrial diversification, urban
segregation, and housing supply elasticity. This chapter's original results as
well as a large established body of literature suggest that fundamentals are
the key drivers of growth. The chapter illustrates this finding with two case
studies: the New York City housing market after September 11, 2001; and the San
Francisco Bay Area in the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Both
areas rebounded strongly after these shocks, suggesting the resilience of the

Matching with Transfers under Distributional Constraints,"We study two-sided many-to-one matching markets with transferable utilities,
e.g., labor and rental housing markets, in which money can exchange hands
between agents, subject to distributional constraints on the set of feasible
allocations. In such markets, we establish the efficiency of equilibrium
arrangements, specified by an assignment and transfers between agents on the
two sides of the market, and study the conditions on the distributional
constraints and agent preferences under which equilibria exist and can be
computed efficiently. To this end, we first consider the setting when the
number of institutions (e.g., firms in a labor market) is one and show that
equilibrium arrangements exist irrespective of the nature of the constraint
structure or the agents' preferences. However, equilibrium arrangements may not
exist in markets with multiple institutions even when agents on each side have
linear (or additively separable) preferences over agents on the other side.
Thus, for markets with linear preferences, we study sufficient conditions on
the constraint structure that guarantee the existence of equilibria using
linear programming duality. Our linear programming approach not only
generalizes that of Shapley and Shubik (1971) in the one-to-one matching
setting to the many-to-one matching setting under distributional constraints
but also provides a method to compute market equilibria efficiently.",Devansh Jalota; Michael Ostrovsky; Marco Pavone,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05232v2,False,True,False,False,False,83.0,Stephen L Ross,Boston,Completed,2006.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4523207,"Matching (statistics), Computer science, Mathematical optimization, Economics, Mathematical economics, Mathematics, Statistics",Stanford University,Stanford University,Stanford University
Essays on Responsible and Sustainable Finance,"The dissertation consists of three essays on responsible and sustainable
finance. I show that local communities should be seen as stakeholders to
decisions made by corporations. In the first essay, I examine whether the
imposition of fiduciary duty on municipal advisors affects bond yields and
advising fees. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, I show that bond
yields reduce by 9\% after the imposition of the SEC Municipal Advisor Rule. In
the second essay, we analyze the impact of USD 40 billion of corporate
subsidies given by U.S. local governments on their borrowing costs. We find
that winning counties experience a 15 bps increase in bond yield spread as
compared to the losing counties. In the third essay, we provide new evidence
that the bankruptcy filing of a locally-headquartered and publicly-listed
manufacturing firm imposes externalities on the local governments. Compared to
matched counties with similar economic trends, municipal bond yields for
affected counties increase by 10 bps within a year of the firm filing for
bankruptcy. The final essay examines whether managers walk the talk on the
environmental and social discussion. We train a deep-learning model on various
corporate sustainability frameworks to construct a comprehensive Environmental
and Social (E and S) dictionary. Using this dictionary, we find that the
discussion of environmental topics in the earnings conference calls of U.S.
public firms is associated with higher pollution abatement and more future

"Kicking You When You're Already Down: The Multipronged Impact of
  Austerity on Crime","The UK Welfare Reform Act 2012 imposed a series of deep welfare cuts, which
disproportionately affected ex-ante poorer areas. In this paper, we provide the
first evidence of the impact of these austerity measures on two different but
complementary elements of crime -- the crime rate and the less-studied
concentration of crime -- over the period 2011-2015 in England and Wales, and
document four new facts. First, areas more exposed to the welfare reforms
experience increased levels of crime, an effect driven by a rise in violent
crime. Second, both violent and property crime become more concentrated within
an area due to the welfare reforms. Third, it is ex-ante more deprived
neighborhoods that bear the brunt of the crime increases over this period.
Fourth, we find no evidence that the welfare reforms increased recidivism,
suggesting that the changes in crime we find are likely driven by new
criminals. Combining these results, we document unambiguous evidence of a
negative spillover of the welfare reforms at the heart of the UK government's
austerity program on social welfare, which reinforced the direct
inequality-worsening effect of this program. Guided by a hedonic house price
model, we calculate the welfare effects implied by the cuts in order to provide
a financial quantification of the impact of the reform. We document an implied
welfare loss of the policy -- borne by the public -- that far exceeds the
savings made to government coffers.",Corrado Giulietti; Brendon McConnell,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08133v4,False,True,False,False,False,92.0,Henry E Brady,Berkeley,Completed,2005.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2012.08133,"Austerity, Spillover effect, Welfare, Welfare reform, Economics, Property crime, Government (linguistics), Inequality, Public economics, Demographic economics, Violent crime, Political science, Macroeconomics, Criminology, Market economy, Sociology, Mathematical analysis, Linguistics, Philosophy, Mathematics, Politics, Law",,,

policymakers in developing effective OA policies Design/methodology/approach
The experiment utilized the OpenAlex database to collect global open access
(OA) publications from Indian state agricultural universities over the past ten
years (2014-2023). Using the Research Organization Registry ID, 97,536
publications were extracted. Data analysis was performed with OpenRefine, and

"On the stochastic and asymptotic improvement of First-Come First-Served
  and Nudge scheduling","Recently it was shown that, contrary to expectations, the
First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm can be stochastically
improved upon by a scheduling algorithm called {\it Nudge} for light-tailed job
size distributions. Nudge partitions jobs into 4 types based on their size, say
small, medium, large and huge jobs. Nudge operates identical to FCFS, except
that whenever a {\it small} job arrives that finds a {\it large} job waiting at
the back of the queue, Nudge swaps the small job with the large one unless the
large job was already involved in an earlier swap.
  In this paper, we show that FCFS can be stochastically improved upon under
far weaker conditions. We consider a system with $2$ job types and limited
swapping between type-$1$ and type-$2$ jobs, but where a type-$1$ job is not
necessarily smaller than a type-$2$ job. More specifically, we introduce and
study the Nudge-$K$ scheduling algorithm which allows type-$1$ jobs to be
swapped with up to $K$ type-$2$ jobs waiting at the back of the queue, while
type-$2$ jobs can be involved in at most one swap. We present an explicit
expression for the response time distribution under Nudge-$K$ when both job
types follow a phase-type distribution. Regarding the asymptotic tail
improvement ratio (ATIR) , we derive a simple expression for the ATIR, as well
as for the $K$ that maximizes the ATIR. We show that the ATIR is positive and
the optimal $K$ tends to infinity in heavy traffic as long as the type-$2$ jobs
are on average longer than the type-$1$ jobs.",Benny Van Houdt,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10428v1,False,True,False,False,False,108.0,Robert K Triest,Boston,Completed,1998.0,https://doi.org/10.1145/3570610,"Swap (finance), Queue, Scheduling (production processes), Computer science, Mathematical optimization, Mathematics, Economics, Computer network, Finance",University of Antwerp,"University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium","University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium"
"The role of industry, occupation, and location specific knowledge in the
  survival of new firms","How do regions acquire the knowledge they need to diversify their economic
activities? How does the migration of workers among firms and industries
contribute to the diffusion of that knowledge? Here we measure the industry,
occupation, and location-specific knowledge carried by workers from one
establishment to the next using a dataset summarizing the individual work
history for an entire country. We study pioneer firms--firms operating in an
industry that was not present in a region--because the success of pioneers is
the basic unit of regional economic diversification. We find that the growth
and survival of pioneers increase significantly when their first hires are
workers with experience in a related industry, and with work experience in the
same location, but not with past experience in a related occupation. We compare
these results with new firms that are not pioneers and find that
industry-specific knowledge is significantly more important for pioneer than
non-pioneer firms. To address endogeneity we use Bartik instruments, which
leverage national fluctuations in the demand for an activity as shocks for
local labor supply. The instrumental variable estimates support the finding
that industry-related knowledge is a predictor of the survival and growth of
pioneer firms. These findings expand our understanding of the micro-mechanisms
underlying regional economic diversification events.",C.

targeting early career researchers (ECRs) at research infrastructures (RIs).
Grounded in established economic models of education and training, our strategy
improves upon existing studies on the same topic in labour market relevance,
scope, and economic modelling. We draw on a survey of ECRs at the European
Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) and find that CERN research training
increases ECRs wages by 7 per cent on average, ranging from 2 to 10 per cent.
Wage gains materialise early in their careers, typically within the first
decade of employment. Wage returns are driven by hard skills, such as software
development, data analysis, and problem solving capacity, as well as sought
after soft skills, such as communication, leadership, and networking. Our
findings suggest that ECRs wage returns primarily reflect productivity
improvements rather than the signalling effect of CERN affiliation. Our

sectors (such as agriculture) to high productivity sectors (such as
manufacturing) are the driver of productivity growth, particularly through
their synergetic effects. Although rural flight represents only one of these
effects, it is certainly the most visible because of the geographical
relocation that it implies; it is also the most well-defined statistically.
Moreover, it will be seen that it is a good indicator of the overall
productivity and attractivity of the non-agricultural sector. Because this
model accounts fairly well for the observed evolution in industrialized
countries, we use it to predict the rate of Chinese economic growth in the
coming decades. Our forecast for the average annual growth of real wages ranges
from 4% to 6% depending on how well China will control the development of its
healthcare industry.",Belal Baaquie; Bertrand M.

"The miniJPAS survey quasar selection III: Classification with artificial
  neural networks and hybridisation","This paper is part of large effort within the J-PAS collaboration that aims
to classify point-like sources in miniJPAS, which were observed in 60 optical
bands over $\sim$ 1 deg$^2$ in the AEGIS field. We developed two algorithms
based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to classify objects into four
categories: stars, galaxies, quasars at low redshift ($z < 2.1)$, and quasars
at high redshift ($z \geq 2.1$). As inputs, we used miniJPAS fluxes for one of
the classifiers (ANN$_1$) and colours for the other (ANN$_2$). The ANNs were
trained and tested using mock data in the first place. We studied the effect of
augmenting the training set by creating hybrid objects, which combines fluxes
from stars, galaxies, and quasars. Nevertheless, the augmentation processing
did not improve the score of the ANN. We also evaluated the performance of the
classifiers in a small subset of the SDSS DR12Q superset observed by miniJPAS.
In the mock test set, the f1-score for quasars at high redshift with the
ANN$_1$ (ANN$_2$) are $0.99$ ($0.99$), $0.93$ ($0.92$), and $0.63$ ($0.57$) for
$17 < r \leq 20$, $20 < r \leq 22.5$, and $22.5 < r \leq 23.6$, respectively,
where $r$ is the J-PAS rSDSS band. In the case of low-redshift quasars,
galaxies, and stars, we reached $0.97$ ($0.97$), $0.82$ ($0.79$), and $0.61$
($0.58$); $0.94$ ($0.94$), $0.90$ ($0.89$), and $0.81$ ($0.80$); and $1.0$
($1.0$), $0.96$ ($0.94$), and $0.70$ ($0.52$) in the same r bins. In the SDSS
DR12Q superset miniJPAS sample, the weighted f1-score reaches 0.87 (0.88) for
objects that are mostly within $20 < r \leq 22.5$. Finally, we estimate the
number of point-like sources that are quasars, galaxies, and stars in miniJPAS.",G. Martínez-Solaeche; Carolina Queiroz; R. M. González Delgado; Natália V. N. Rodrigues; R.

"Identification and Estimation of Demand Models with Endogenous Product
  Entry and Exit","This paper deals with the endogeneity of firms' entry and exit decisions in
demand estimation. Product entry decisions lack a single crossing property in
terms of demand unobservables, which causes the inconsistency of conventional
methods dealing with selection. We present a novel and straightforward two-step
approach to estimate demand while addressing endogenous product entry. In the
first step, our method estimates a finite mixture model of product entry
accommodating latent market types. In the second step, it estimates demand
controlling for the propensity scores of all latent market types. We apply this
approach to data from the airline industry.",Victor Aguirregabiria; Alessandro Iaria; Senay Sokullu,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14196v1,False,True,False,False,False,125.0,Ann C Schatzer,Washington,Completed,2000.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4554232,"Identification (biology), Estimation, Econometrics, Economics, Business, Computer science, Management, Biology, Botany",University of Bristol; University of Toronto,"University of Toronto - Department of Economics; University of Bristol, School of Economics; University of Bristol - Department of Economics","University of Toronto - Department of Economics; University of Bristol, School of Economics; University of Bristol - Department of Economics"
The Structure and Incentives of a COVID related Emergency Wage Subsidy,"During recent crisis, wage subsidies played a major role in sheltering firms
and households from economic shocks. During COVID-19, most workers were
affected and many liberal welfare states introduced new temporary wage
subsidies to protected workers' earnings and employment (OECD, 2021). New wage
subsidies marked a departure from the structure of traditional income support
payments and required reform. This paper uses simulated datasets to assess the
structure and incentives of the Irish COVID-19 wage subsidy scheme (CWS) under
five designs. We use a nowcasting approach to update 2017 microdata, producing
a near real time picture of the labour market at the peak of the crisis. Using
microsimulation modelling, we assess the impact of different designs on income
replacement, work incentives and income inequality. Our findings suggest that
pro rata designs support middle earners more and flat rate designs support low
earners more. We find evidence for strong work disincentives under all designs,
though flat rate designs perform better. Disincentives are primarily driven by
generous unemployment payments and work related costs. The impact of design on
income inequality depends on the generosity of payments. Earnings related pro
rata designs were associated to higher market earnings inequality. The
difference in inequality levels falls once benefits, taxes and work related
costs are considered. In our discussion, we turn to transaction costs, the
rationale for reform and reintegration of CWS. We find some support for the
claim that design changes were motivated by political considerations. We
suggest that establishing permanent wage subsidies based on sectorial turnover
rules could offer enhanced protection to middle-and high-earners and reduce
uncertainty, the need for reform, and the risk of politically motivated
designs.",Jules Linden; Cathal O'Donoghue; Denisa M.

On estimating Armington elasticities for Japan's meat imports,"By fully accounting for the distinct tariff regimes levied on imported meat,
we estimate substitution elasticities of Japan's two-stage import aggregation
functions for beef, chicken and pork. While the regression analysis crucially
depends on the price that consumers face, the post-tariff price of imported
meat depends not only on ad valorem duties but also on tariff rate quotas and
gate price system regimes. The effective tariff rate is consequently evaluated
by utilizing monthly transaction data. To address potential endogeneity
problems, we apply exchange rates that we believe to be independent of the
demand shocks for imported meat. The panel nature of the data allows us to
retrieve the first-stage aggregates via time dummy variables, free of demand
shocks, to be used as part of the explanatory variable and as an instrument in
the second-stage regression.",Satoshi Nakano; Kazuhiko Nishimura,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05358v2,False,True,False,False,False,127.0,Catherine Armington,Washington,Completed,1999.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/1477-9552.12539,"Tariff, Endogeneity, Economics, Econometrics, Database transaction, Ad valorem tax, Variable (mathematics), Substitution (logic), International economics, Public economics, Mathematics, Computer science, Mathematical analysis, Double taxation, Programming language",Nihon Fukushi University; Chukyo University,"School of Global Studies, Chukyo University, Aichi, Japan; Faculty of Economics, Nihon Fukushi University, Aichi, Japan","School of Global Studies, Chukyo University, Aichi, Japan; Faculty of Economics, Nihon Fukushi University, Aichi, Japan"
"Identification of Regulatory Requirements Relevant to Business
  Processes: A Comparative Study on Generative AI, Embedding-based Ranking,
  Crowd and Expert-driven Methods","Organizations face the challenge of ensuring compliance with an increasing
amount of requirements from various regulatory documents. Which requirements
are relevant depends on aspects such as the geographic location of the
organization, its domain, size, and business processes. Considering these
contextual factors, as a first step, relevant documents (e.g., laws,
regulations, directives, policies) are identified, followed by a more detailed
analysis of which parts of the identified documents are relevant for which step
of a given business process. Nowadays the identification of regulatory
requirements relevant to business processes is mostly done manually by domain
and legal experts, posing a tremendous effort on them, especially for a large
number of regulatory documents which might frequently change. Hence, this work
examines how legal and domain experts can be assisted in the assessment of
relevant requirements. For this, we compare an embedding-based NLP ranking
method, a generative AI method using GPT-4, and a crowdsourced method with the
purely manual method of creating relevancy labels by experts. The proposed
methods are evaluated based on two case studies: an Australian insurance case
created with domain experts and a global banking use case, adapted from SAP
Signavio's workflow example of an international guideline. A gold standard is
created for both BPMN2.0 processes and matched to real-world textual
requirements from multiple regulatory documents. The evaluation and discussion
provide insights into strengths and weaknesses of each method regarding
applicability, automation, transparency, and reproducibility and provide
guidelines on which method combinations will maximize benefits for given
characteristics such as process usage, impact, and dynamics of an application
scenario.",Catherine Sai; Shazia Sadiq; Lei Han; Gianluca Demartini; Stefanie Rinderle-Ma,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02986v1,False,True,False,False,False,127.0,Catherine Armington,Washington,Completed,1999.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2401.02986,"Computer science, Identification (biology), Workflow, Domain (mathematical analysis), Transparency (behavior), Business process, Ranking (information retrieval), Requirements engineering, Process (computing), Data science, Process management, Knowledge management, Information retrieval, Business, Work in process, Database, Computer security, Marketing, Programming language, Mathematical analysis, Botany, Operating system, Mathematics, Software, Biology",,,
"An Algorithm to Extract Rules from Artificial Neural Networks for
  Medical Diagnosis Problems","Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been successfully applied to solve a
variety of classification and function approximation problems. Although ANNs
can generally predict better than decision trees for pattern classification
problems, ANNs are often regarded as black boxes since their predictions cannot
be explained clearly like those of decision trees. This paper presents a new
algorithm, called rule extraction from ANNs (REANN), to extract rules from
trained ANNs for medical diagnosis problems. A standard three-layer feedforward
ANN with four-phase training is the basis of the proposed algorithm. In the
first phase, the number of hidden nodes in ANNs is determined automatically by
a constructive algorithm. In the second phase, irrelevant connections and input
nodes are removed from trained ANNs without sacrificing the predictive accuracy
of ANNs. The continuous activation values of the hidden nodes are discretized
by using an efficient heuristic clustering algorithm in the third phase.
Finally, rules are extracted from compact ANNs by examining the discretized
activation values of the hidden nodes. Extensive experimental studies on three
benchmark classification problems, i.e. breast cancer, diabetes and lenses,
demonstrate that REANN can generate high quality rules from ANNs, which are
comparable with other methods in terms of number of rules, average number of
conditions for a rule, and predictive accuracy.",S. M. Kamruzzaman; Md.

Optimal Ordering Policies for Multi-Echelon Supply Networks,"In this paper, we formulate an optimal ordering policy as a stochastic
control problem where each firm decides the amount of input goods to order from
their upstream suppliers based on the current inventory level of its output
good. For this purpose, we provide a closed-form solution for the optimal
request of the raw materials for given a fixed production policy. We implement
the proposed policy on a 15-firm acyclic network based on a real product supply
chain. We first simulate ideal demand situations, and then we implement
demand-side shocks (i.e., demand levels outside of those considered in the
policy formulation) and supply-side shocks (i.e., halts in production for some
suppliers) to evaluate the robustness of the proposed policies.",Jose I. Caiza; Ian Walter; Jitesh H. Panchal; Junjie Qin; Philip E.

Impact of carbon market on production emissions,"The aim of this paper is to address the effect of the carbon emission
allowance market on the production policy of a large polluter production firm.
We investigate this effect in two cases; when the large polluter cannot affect
the risk premium of the allowance market, and when it can change the risk
premium by its production. In this simple model, we ignore any possible
investment of the firm in pollution reducing technologies. We formulate the
problem of optimal production by a stochastic optimization problem. Then, we
show that, as expected, the market reduces the optimal production policy in the
first case if the firm is not given a generous initial cheap allowance package.
However, when the large producer activities can change the market risk premium,
the cut on the production and consequently pollution cannot be guaranteed. In
fact, there are cases in this model when the optimal production is {\it always}
larger than expected, and an increase in production, and thus pollution, can
increase the profit of the firm. We conclude that some of the parameters of the
market which contribute to this effect can be wisely controlled by the
regulators in order to diminish this manipulative behavior of the firm.",Arash Fahim; Nizar Touzi,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03665v1,False,True,False,False,False,129.0,Chad Shirley,UCLA,Completed,1999.0,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aav3506,"Chemical industry, Renewable energy, Fossil fuel, Syngas, Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, Environmental science, Petrochemical, Greenhouse gas, Synthetic fuel, Chemical energy, Waste management, Chemistry, Chemical reaction, Catalysis, Environmental engineering, Engineering, Carbon monoxide, Organic chemistry, Ecology, Biology, Electrical engineering",Stanford University; National Research Council Canada; McMaster University; SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory; University of Toronto,"TOTAL American Services Inc., Hopkinton, MA 01748, USA.; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3E4, Canada.; National Research Council Canada, Ottawa, Ontario K1N 0R6, Canada.; Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA.; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3G4, Canada.; Department of Chemical Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario L8S 4L8, Canada.","TOTAL American Services Inc., Hopkinton, MA 01748, USA.; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3E4, Canada.; National Research Council Canada, Ottawa, Ontario K1N 0R6, Canada.; Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA.; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3G4, Canada.; Department of Chemical Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario L8S 4L8, Canada."
Talent Hoarding in Organizations,"Most organizations rely on managers to identify talented workers. However,
managers who are evaluated on team performance have an incentive to hoard
workers. This study provides the first empirical evidence of talent hoarding
using personnel records and survey evidence from a large manufacturing firm.
Talent hoarding is reported by three-fourths of managers, is detectable in
managerial decisions, and occurs more frequently when hoarding incentives are
stronger. Using quasi-random variation in exposure to talent hoarding, I
demonstrate that hoarding deters workers from applying to new positions,
inhibiting worker career progression and altering the allocation of talent in

competitiveness. We use a novel dataset on the careers of 165,084 managers
employed by 13,106 companies in the United Kingdom in the period 2009-2017. We
find that domestic manufacturing firms become, on average, between 7% and 12%
more productive after hiring the first foreign managers, whereas foreign-owned
firms register no significant improvement. In particular, we test that previous
industry-specific experience is the primary driver of productivity gains in
domestic firms (15.6%), in a way that allows the latter to catch up with
foreign-owned firms. Managers from the European Union are highly valuable, as
they represent about half of the recruits in our data. Our identification
strategy combines matching techniques, difference-in-difference, and
pre-recruitment trends to challenge reverse causality. Results are robust to
placebo tests and to different estimators of Total Factor Productivity.

"Developing Talent from a Supply-Demand Perspective: An Optimization
  Model for Managers","While executives emphasize that human resources (HR) are a firm's biggest
asset, the level of research attention devoted to planning talent pipelines for
complex global organizational environments does not reflect this emphasis.
Numerous challenges exist in establishing human resource management strategies
aligned with strategic operations planning and growth strategies. We generalize
the problem of managing talent from a supply-demand standpoint through a
resource acquisition lens, to an industrial business case where an organization
recruits for multiple roles given a limited pool of potential candidates
acquired through a limited number of recruiting channels. In this context, we
develop an innovative analytical model in a stochastic environment to assist
managers with talent planning in their organizations. We apply supply chain
concepts to the problem, whereby individuals with specific competencies are
treated as unique products. We first develop a multi-period mixed integer
nonlinear programming model and then exploit chance-constrained programming to
a linearized instance of the model to handle stochastic parameters, which
follow any arbitrary distribution functions. Next, we use an empirical study to
validate the model with a large global manufacturing company, and demonstrate
how the proposed model can effectively manage talents in a practical context. A
stochastic analysis on the implemented case study reveals that a reasonable
improvement is derived from incorporating randomness into the problem.",Hadi Moheb-Alizadeh; Robert B.

"Dynamical geography and transition paths of Sargassum in the tropical
  Atlantic","By analyzing a time-homogeneous Markov chain constructed using trajectories
of undrogued drifting buoys from the NOAA's Global Drifter Program, we find
that probability density can distribute in a manner that resembles very closely
the recently observed recurrent belt of high Sargassum density in the tropical
Atlantic between 5--10$^{\circ}$N, coined the \emph{Great Atlantic Sargassum
Belt} (\emph{GASB}). A spectral analysis of the associated transition matrix
further unveils a forward attracting almost-invariant set in the northwestern
Gulf of Mexico with a corresponding basin of attraction disconnected from the
Sargasso Sea, but including the nutrient-rich regions around the Amazon and

two potential pathways for Sargassum into the IAS from the upwelling system off
the coast of Africa are revealed. One TPT-inferred pathway takes place along
the GASB. The second pathway is more southern and slower, first going through
the Gulf of Guinea, then across the tropical Atlantic toward the mouth of the
Amazon River, and finally along the northeastern South American margin. The
existence of such a southern TPT-inferred pathway may have consequences for
bloom stimulation by nutrients from river runoff.",F. J. Beron-Vera; M. J. Olascoaga; N. Putman; J. Trinanes; G. J. Goni; R.

"Preventing Eviction-Caused Homelessness through ML-Informed Distribution
  of Rental Assistance","Rental assistance programs provide individuals with financial assistance to
prevent housing instabilities caused by evictions and avert homelessness. Since
these programs operate under resource constraints, they must decide who to
prioritize. Typically, funding is distributed by a reactive or first-come-first
serve allocation process that does not systematically consider risk of future
homelessness. We partnered with Allegheny County, PA to explore a proactive
allocation approach that prioritizes individuals facing eviction based on their
risk of future homelessness. Our ML system that uses state and county
administrative data to accurately identify individuals in need of support
outperforms simpler prioritization approaches by at least 20% while being fair
and equitable across race and gender. Furthermore, our approach would identify
28% of individuals who are overlooked by the current process and end up
homeless. Beyond improvements to the rental assistance program in Allegheny
County, this study can inform the development of evidence-based decision
support tools in similar contexts, including lessons about data needs, model
design, evaluation, and field validation.",Catalina Vajiac; Arun Frey; Joachim Baumann; Abigail Smith; Kasun Amarasinghe; Alice Lai; Kit Rodolfa; Rayid Ghani,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12599v1,False,True,False,False,False,160.0,Dirk W Early,Berkeley,Completed,2001.0,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v38i20.30246,"Eviction, Renting, Rental housing, Business, Distribution (mathematics), Political science, Criminology, Psychology, Law, Mathematics, Mathematical analysis",Stanford University; University of Zurich; ZHAW Zurich University of Applied Sciences; National Opinion Research Center; University of Chicago; Carnegie Mellon University,"Stanford University; University of Zurich

"Are the Spatial Concentrations of Core-City and Suburban Poverty
  Converging in the Rust Belt?","Decades of deindustrialization have led to economic decline and population
loss throughout the U.S. Midwest, with the highest national poverty rates found
in Detroit, Cleveland, and Buffalo. This poverty is often confined to core
cities themselves, however, as many of their surrounding suburbs continue to
prosper. Poverty can therefore be highly concentrated at the MSA level, but
more evenly distributed within the borders of the city proper. One result of
this disparity is that if suburbanites consider poverty to be confined to the
central city, they might be less willing to devote resources to alleviate it.
But due to recent increases in suburban poverty, particularly since the 2008
recession, such urban-suburban gaps might be shrinking. Using Census
tract-level data, this study quantifies poverty concentrations for four ""Rust
Belt"" MSAs, comparing core-city and suburban concentrations in 2000, 2010, and
2015. There is evidence of a large gap between core cities and outlying areas,
which is closing in the three highest-poverty cities, but not in Milwaukee. A
set of four comparison cities show a smaller, more stable city-suburban divide
in the U.S. ""Sunbelt,"" while Chicago resembles a ""Rust Belt"" metro.",Scott W.

Small cities face greater impact from automation,"The city has proven to be the most successful form of human agglomeration and
provides wide employment opportunities for its dwellers. As advances in
robotics and artificial intelligence revive concerns about the impact of
automation on jobs, a question looms: How will automation affect employment in
cities? Here, we provide a comparative picture of the impact of automation
across U.S. urban areas. Small cities will undertake greater adjustments, such
as worker displacement and job content substitutions. We demonstrate that large
cities exhibit increased occupational and skill specialization due to increased
abundance of managerial and technical professions. These occupations are not
easily automatable, and, thus, reduce the potential impact of automation in
large cities. Our results pass several robustness checks including potential
errors in the estimation of occupational automation and sub-sampling of
occupations. Our study provides the first empirical law connecting two societal
forces: urban agglomeration and automation's impact on employment.",Morgan R.

"An Empirical Study on LLM-based Classification of Requirements-related
  Provisions in Food-safety Regulations","As Industry 4.0 transforms the food industry, the role of software in
achieving compliance with food-safety regulations is becoming increasingly
critical. Food-safety regulations, like those in many legal domains, have
largely been articulated in a technology-independent manner to ensure their
longevity and broad applicability. However, this approach leaves a gap between
the regulations and the modern systems and software increasingly used to
implement them. In this article, we pursue two main goals. First, we conduct a
Grounded Theory study of food-safety regulations and develop a conceptual
characterization of food-safety concepts that closely relate to systems and
software requirements. Second, we examine the effectiveness of two families of
large language models (LLMs) -- BERT and GPT -- in automatically classifying
legal provisions based on requirements-related food-safety concepts. Our
results show that: (a) when fine-tuned, the accuracy differences between the
best-performing models in the BERT and GPT families are relatively small.
Nevertheless, the most powerful model in our experiments, GPT-4o, still
achieves the highest accuracy, with an average Precision of 89% and an average
Recall of 87%; (b) few-shot learning with GPT-4o increases Recall to 97% but
decreases Precision to 65%, suggesting a trade-off between fine-tuning and
few-shot learning; (c) despite our training examples being drawn exclusively
from Canadian regulations, LLM-based classification performs consistently well
on test provisions from the US, indicating a degree of generalizability across
regulatory jurisdictions; and (d) for our classification task, LLMs
significantly outperform simpler baselines constructed using long short-term
memory (LSTM) networks and automatic keyword extraction.",Shabnam Hassani; Mehrdad Sabetzadeh; Daniel Amyot,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14683v1,False,True,False,False,False,162.0,Michael E Ollinger,Washington,Completed,2007.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2501.14683,"Food safety, Business, Food science, Chemistry",,,
"U.S. Long-Term Earnings Outcomes by Sex, Race, Ethnicity, and Place of

comparison of earnings inequality, volatility, and mobility. Using data from
the U.S. Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD)
infrastructure files we produce a uniform set of earnings statistics for the
U.S. From 1998 to 2019, we find U.S. earnings inequality has increased and
volatility has decreased. The combination of increased inequality and reduced
volatility suggest earnings growth differs substantially across different
demographic groups. We explore this further by estimating 12-year average
earnings for a single cohort of age 25-54 eligible workers. Differences in
labor supply (hours paid and quarters worked) are found to explain almost 90%
of the variation in worker earnings, although even after controlling for labor
supply substantial earnings differences across demographic groups remain
unexplained. Using a quantile regression approach, we estimate counterfactual
earnings distributions for each demographic group. We find that at the bottom
of the earnings distribution differences in characteristics such as hours paid,
geographic division, industry, and education explain almost all the earnings
gap, however above the median the contribution of the differences in the
returns to characteristics becomes the dominant component.",Kevin L. McKinney; John M. Abowd; Hubert P.

"Personalized Food Image Classification: Benchmark Datasets and New
  Baseline","Food image classification is a fundamental step of image-based dietary
assessment, enabling automated nutrient analysis from food images. Many current
methods employ deep neural networks to train on generic food image datasets
that do not reflect the dynamism of real-life food consumption patterns, in
which food images appear sequentially over time, reflecting the progression of
what an individual consumes. Personalized food classification aims to address
this problem by training a deep neural network using food images that reflect
the consumption pattern of each individual. However, this problem is
under-explored and there is a lack of benchmark datasets with individualized
food consumption patterns due to the difficulty in data collection. In this
work, we first introduce two benchmark personalized datasets including the
Food101-Personal, which is created based on surveys of daily dietary patterns
from participants in the real world, and the VFNPersonal, which is developed
based on a dietary study. In addition, we propose a new framework for
personalized food image classification by leveraging self-supervised learning
and temporal image feature information. Our method is evaluated on both
benchmark datasets and shows improved performance compared to existing works.

Alignment normally requires considerable knowledge and expertise of skilled

simple two mirror system we identify and examine three different automation
approaches. They are: artificial neural networks; practice-led, which mimics
manual alignment practices; and design-led, modelling from first principles. We
find that these approaches make use of three different types of knowledge 1)
basic system knowledge (of controls, measurements and goals); 2) behavioural
skills and expertise, and 3) fundamental system design knowledge. We
demonstrate that the different automation approaches vary significantly in
human resources, and measurement sampling budgets. This will have implications

"Structuring the Chaos: Enabling Small Business Cyber-Security Risks &
  Assets Modelling with a UML Class Model","Small businesses are increasingly adopting IT, and consequently becoming more
vulnerable to cyber-incidents. Whilst small businesses are aware of the
cyber-security risks, many struggle with implementing mitigations. Some of
these can be traced to fundamental differences in the characteristics of small
business versus large enterprises where modern cyber-security solutions are
widely deployed.
  Small business specific cyber-security tools are needed. Currently available
cyber-security tools and standards assume technical expertise and time
resources often not practical for small businesses. Cyber-security competes
with other roles that small business owners take on, e.g. cleaning, sales etc.
A small business model, salient and implementable at-scale, with simplified
non-specialist terminologies and presentation is needed to encourage sustained
participation of all stakeholders, not just technical ones.
  We propose a new UML class (Small IT Data (SITD)) model to support the often
chaotic information-gathering phase of a small business' first foray into
cyber-security. The SITD model is designed in the UML format to help small
business implement technical solutions. The SITD model structure stays relevant
by using generic classes and structures that evolve with technology and
environmental changes. The SITD model keeps security decisions proportionate to
the business by highlighting relationships between business strategy tasks and
IT infrastructure.
  We construct a set of design principles to address small business
cyber-security needs. Model components are designed in response to these needs.
The uses of the SITD model are then demonstrated and design principles
validated by examining a case study of a real small business operational and IT
information. The SITD model's ability to illustrate breach information is also
demonstrated using the NotPetya incident.",Tracy Tam; Asha Rao; Joanne Hall,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14872v1,False,True,False,False,False,188.0,Robert W Fairlie,Washington,Completed,2003.0,,No keywords found,,,
Tripartite Vector Representations for Better Job Recommendation,"Job recommendation is a crucial part of the online job recruitment business.
To match the right person with the right job, a good representation of job
postings is required. Such representations should ideally recommend jobs with
fitting titles, aligned skill set, and reasonable commute. To address these
aspects, we utilize three information graphs ( job-job, skill-skill, job-skill)
from historical job data to learn a joint representation for both job titles
and skills in a shared latent space. This allows us to gain a representation of
job postings/ resume using both elements, which subsequently can be combined
with location. In this paper, we first present how the presentation of each
component is obtained, and then we discuss how these different representations
are combined together into one single space to acquire the final

different base-line methods show significant improvement in terms of relevancy.",Mengshu Liu; Jingya Wang; Kareem Abdelfatah; Mohammed Korayem,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12379v1,False,True,False,False,False,192.0,John R Logan,UCLA,Completed,2003.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1907.12379,"Representation (politics), Set (abstract data type), Computer science, Space (punctuation), Job analysis, Job shadow, Presentation (obstetrics), Job performance, Vector space model, Line (geometry), Information retrieval, Job design, Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Job satisfaction, Psychology, Mathematics, Social psychology, Political science, Medicine, Geometry, Politics, Law, Radiology, Programming language, Operating system",,,
"Estimating the Likelihood of Arrest from Police Records in Presence of
  Unreported Crimes","Many important policy decisions concerning policing hinge on our
understanding of how likely various criminal offenses are to result in arrests.
Since many crimes are never reported to law enforcement, estimates based on
police records alone must be adjusted to account for the likelihood that each
crime would have been reported to the police. In this paper, we present a
methodological framework for estimating the likelihood of arrest from police
data that incorporates estimates of crime reporting rates computed from a
victimization survey. We propose a parametric regression-based two-step
estimator that (i) estimates the likelihood of crime reporting using logistic
regression with survey weights; and then (ii) applies a second regression step
to model the likelihood of arrest. Our empirical analysis focuses on racial
disparities in arrests for violent crimes (sex offenses, robbery, aggravated
and simple assaults) from 2006--2015 police records from the National Incident
Based Reporting System (NIBRS), with estimates of crime reporting obtained
using 2003--2020 data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). We
find that, after adjusting for unreported crimes, the likelihood of arrest
computed from police records decreases significantly. We also find that, while
incidents with white offenders on average result in arrests more often than
those with black offenders, the disparities tend to be small after accounting
for crime characteristics and unreported crimes.",Riccardo Fogliato; Arun Kumar Kuchibhotla; Zachary Lipton; Daniel Nagin; Alice Xiang; Alexandra Chouldechova,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07935v1,False,False,False,False,True,194.0,Eric P Baumer,Chicago,Completed,2003.0,https://doi.org/10.1214/23-aoas1833,"Criminology, Psychology, Political science",Carnegie Mellon University; Sony Corporation (United States); Amazon (United States),"Sony AI; Department of Machine Learning, Carnegie Mellon University; Amazon Web Services; Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University; Department of Statistics and Data Science, Carnegie Mellon University","Sony AI; Department of Machine Learning, Carnegie Mellon University; Amazon Web Services; Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University; Department of Statistics and Data Science, Carnegie Mellon University"
"Bayesian models to adjust for response bias in survey data for
  estimating rape and domestic violence rates from the NCVS","It is difficult to accurately estimate the rates of rape and domestic
violence due to the sensitive nature of these crimes. There is evidence that
bias in estimating the crime rates from survey data may arise because some
women respondents are ""gagged"" in reporting some types of crimes by the use of
a telephone rather than a personal interview, and by the presence of a spouse
during the interview. On the other hand, as data on these crimes are collected
every year, it would be more efficient in data analysis if we could identify
and make use of information from previous data. In this paper we propose a
model to adjust the estimates of the rates of rape and domestic violence to
account for the response bias due to the ""gag"" factors. To estimate parameters
in the model, we identify the information that is not sensitive to time and
incorporate this into prior distributions. The strength of Bayesian estimators
is their ability to combine information from long observational records in a
sensible way. Within a Bayesian framework, we develop an
Expectation-Maximization-Bayesian (EMB) algorithm for computation in analyzing
contingency table and we apply the jackknife to estimate the accuracy of the
estimates. Our approach is illustrated using the yearly crime data from the
National Crime Victimization Survey. The illustration shows that compared with
the classical method, our model leads to more efficient estimation but does not
require more complicated computation.",Qingzhao Yu; Elizabeth A.

Mobility and Transit Segregation in Urban Spaces,"Segregation is a highly nuanced concept that researchers have worked to
define and measure over the past several decades. Conventional approaches tend
to estimate segregation based on residential patterns in a static manner. In
this work, we analyse socioeconomic inequalities, assessing segregation in
various dimensions of the urban experience. Moreover, we consider the pivotal
role that transport plays in democratising access to opportunities. Using
transport networks, amenity visitations, and census data, we develop a
framework to approximate segregation, within the United States, for various
dimensions of urban life. We find that neighbourhoods that are segregated in
the residential domain, tend to exhibit similar levels of segregation in
amenity visitation patterns and transit usage, albeit to a lesser extent. We
identify inequalities embedded into transit service, which impose constraints
on residents from segregated areas, limiting the neighbourhoods that they can
access within an hour to areas that are similarly disadvantaged. By exploring
socioeconomic segregation from a transit perspective, we underscore the
importance of conceptualising segregation as a dynamic measure, while also
highlighting how transport systems can contribute to a cycle of disadvantage.",Nandini Iyer; Ronaldo Menezes; Hugo Barbosa,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07086v1,False,True,False,False,False,221.0,Jacob Vigdor,Triangle,Completed,2005.0,https://doi.org/10.1177/23998083231219294,"Amenity, Socioeconomic status, Disadvantaged, Geography, Inequality, Economic geography, Gentrification, Demographic economics, Census, Public transport, Sociology, Economic growth, Transport engineering, Business, Economics, Population, Engineering, Demography, Mathematical analysis, Mathematics, Finance",Universidade Federal do Ceará; University of Exeter,"University of Exeter, UK; University of Exeter, UK; Federal University of Ceará, Brazil","University of Exeter, UK; University of Exeter, UK; Federal University of Ceará, Brazil"
"Trade, Trees, and Lives","This paper shows a cascading mechanism through which international
trade-induced deforestation results in a decline of health outcomes in cities
distant from where trade activities occur. We examine Brazil, which has ramped
up agricultural export over the last two decades to meet rising global demand.
Using a shift-share research design, we first show that export shocks cause
substantial local agricultural expansion and a virtual one-for-one decline in
forest cover. We then construct a dynamic area-of-effect model that predicts
where atmospheric changes should be felt - due to loss of forests that would
otherwise serve to filter out and absorb air pollutants as they travel -
downwind of the deforestation areas. Leveraging quasi-random variation in these
atmospheric connections, we establish a causal link between deforestation
upstream and subsequent rises in air pollution and premature deaths downstream,
with the mortality effects predominantly driven by cardiovascular and
respiratory causes. Our estimates reveal a large telecoupled health externality
of trade deforestation: over 700,000 premature deaths in Brazil over the past
two decades. This equates to $0.18 loss in statistical life value per $1

where diversification between two clades happens in an unusually regular
fashion. In order to be able to distinguish interesting events from
stochasticity, we propose two classes of neutral models on trees with timing
information and develop a statistical framework for testing these models. Our
models substantially generalize both the coalescent with ancestral population
size variation and the global-rate speciation-extinction models. We end the
paper with several example applications: first, we show that the evolution of
the Hepatitis C virus appears to proceed in a lineage-specific bursting
fashion. Second, we analyze a large tree of ants, demonstrating that a period
of elevated diversification rates does not appear to occurred in a bursting
manner.",Daniel Ford; Tanja Gernhard; Frederick Matsen,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1510v1,False,True,False,False,False,246.0,Belen Villalonga,Boston,Completed,2003.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syp018,"Coalescent theory, Biology, Phylogenetic tree, Clade, Diversification (marketing strategy), Evolutionary biology, Most recent common ancestor, Lineage (genetic), Population, Effective population size, Phylogenetics, Genetics, Genetic variation, Demography, Gene, Marketing, Sociology, Business","Google (United States); ETH Zurich; University of California, Berkeley","Institut für Integrative Biologie, ETH Zentrum/CHN K 12.2, Universitätstrasse 16, 8092 Zürich, Switzerland; Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View , CA , 94043 , USA; Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley, 367 Evans Hall #429, Berkeley, CA 94720-3860, USA","Institut für Integrative Biologie, ETH Zentrum/CHN K 12.2, Universitätstrasse 16, 8092 Zürich, Switzerland; Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View , CA , 94043 , USA; Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley, 367 Evans Hall #429, Berkeley, CA 94720-3860, USA"
"Encouraging Emotion Regulation in Social Media Conversations through
  Self-Reflection","Anonymity in social media platforms keeps users hidden behind a keyboard.
This absolves users of responsibility, allowing them to engage in online rage,
hate speech, and other text-based toxicity that harms online well-being. Recent
research in the field of Digital Emotion Regulation (DER) has revealed that
indulgence in online toxicity can be a result of ineffective emotional
regulation (ER). This, we believe, can be reduced by educating users about the
consequences of their actions. Prior DER research has primarily focused on
exploring digital emotion regulation practises, identifying emotion regulation
using multimodal sensors, and encouraging users to act responsibly in online
conversations. While these studies provide valuable insights into how users
consciously utilise digital media for emotion regulation, they do not capture
the contextual dynamics of emotion regulation online. Through interaction
design, this work provides an intervention for the delivery of ER support. It
introduces a novel technique for identifying the need for emotional regulation
in online conversations and delivering information to users in a way that
integrates didactic learning into their daily life. By fostering
self-reflection in periods of intensified emotional expression, we present a
graph-based framework for on-the-spot emotion regulation support in online
conversations. Our findings suggest that using this model in a conversation can
help identify its influential threads/nodes to locate where toxicity is
concentrated and help reduce it by up to 12\%. This is the first study in the
field of DER that focuses on learning transfer by inducing self-reflection and
implicit emotion regulation.",Akriti Verma; Shama Islam; Valeh Moghaddam; Adnan Anwar,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00884v1,False,True,False,False,False,247.0,Lori S Bennear,Triangle,Completed,2007.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4376558,"Social media, Reflection (computer programming), Self-reflection, Social psychology, Psychology, Political science, Sociology, Computer science, Psychoanalysis, Law, Programming language",Deakin University,Deakin University,Deakin University
"A Bayesian hierarchical small-area population model accounting for data
  source specific methodologies from American Community Survey, Population
  Estimates Program, and Decennial Census data","Small area estimates of population are necessary for many epidemiological
studies, yet their quality and accuracy are often not assessed. In the United
States, small area estimates of population counts are published by the United
States Census Bureau (USCB) in the form of the Decennial census counts,
Intercensal population projections (PEP), and American Community Survey (ACS)
estimates. Although there are significant relationships between these data
sources, there are important contrasts in data collection and processing
methodologies, such that each set of estimates may be subject to different
sources and magnitudes of error. Additionally, these data sources do not report
identical small area population counts due to post-survey adjustments specific
to each data source. Resulting small area disease/mortality rates may differ
depending on which data source is used for population counts (denominator
data). To accurately capture annual small area population counts, and
associated uncertainties, we present a Bayesian population model (B-Pop), which
fuses information from all three USCB sources, accounting for data source
specific methodologies and associated errors. The main features of our
framework are: 1) a single model integrating multiple data sources, 2)
accounting for data source specific data generating mechanisms, and
specifically accounting for data source specific errors, and 3) prediction of
estimates for years without USCB reported data. We focus our study on the 159

"The effect of remote work on urban transportation emissions: evidence
  from 141 cities","The overall impact of working from home (WFH) on transportation emissions
remains a complex issue, with significant implications for policymaking. This
study matches socioeconomic information from American Community Survey (ACS) to
the global carbon emissions dataset for selected Metropolitan Statistical Areas
(MSAs) in the US. We analyze the impact of WFH on transportation emissions
before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Employing cross-sectional multiple
regression models and Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition, we examine how WFH,
commuting mode, and car ownership influence transportation emissions across 141
MSAs in the United States. We find that the prevalence of WFH in 2021 is
associated with lower transportation emissions, whereas WFH in 2019 did not
significantly impact transportation emissions. After controlling for public
transportation usage and car ownership, we find that a 1% increase in WFH
corresponds to a 0.17 kilogram or 1.8% reduction of daily average
transportation emissions per capita. The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition shows
that WFH is the main driver in reducing transportation emissions per capita
during the pandemic. Our results show that the reductive influence of public
transportation on transportation emissions has declined, while the impact of
car ownership on increasing transportation emissions has risen. Collectively,
these results indicate a multifaceted impact of WFH on transportation
emissions. This study underscores the need for a nuanced, data-driven approach
in crafting WFH policies to mitigate transportation emissions effectively.",Sophia Shen; Xinyi Wang; Nicholas Caros; Jinhua Zhao,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00422v1,False,False,False,False,True,248.0,Emily Parkany,Washington,Completed,2003.0,https://doi.org/10.1038/nature15371,"Air pollution, Air quality index, Particulates, Environmental science, Environmental health, Pollution, China, East Asia, Environmental protection, Geography, Meteorology, Medicine, Ecology, Biology, Archaeology",Cyprus Institute; King Saud University; Harvard University; Max Planck Institute for Chemistry,"King Saud University, College of Science, Riyadh, 11451, Saudi Arabia; Atmospheric Chemistry Department, Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Mainz, 55128, Germany; The Cyprus Institute, Energy, Environment and Water Research Center, Nicosia, 1645, Cyprus; Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, 02215, Massachusetts, USA","King Saud University, College of Science, Riyadh, 11451, Saudi Arabia; Atmospheric Chemistry Department, Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Mainz, 55128, Germany; The Cyprus Institute, Energy, Environment and Water Research Center, Nicosia, 1645, Cyprus; Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, 02215, Massachusetts, USA"
Short Selling with Margin Risk and Recall Risk,"Short sales are regarded as negative purchases in textbook asset pricing
theory. In reality, however, the symmetry between purchases and short sales is
broken by a variety of costs and risks peculiar to the latter. We formulate an
optimal stopping model in which the decision to cover a short position is
affected by two short sale-specific frictions---margin risk and recall risk.
Margin risk refers to the fact that short sales are collateralised
transactions, which means that short sellers may be forced to close out their
positions involuntarily if they cannot fund margin calls. Recall risk refers to
a peculiarity of the stock lending market, which permits lenders to recall
borrowed stock at any time, once again triggering involuntary close-outs. We
examine the effect of these frictions on the optimal close-out strategy and
quantify the loss of value resulting from each. Our results show that realistic
short selling constraints have a dramatic impact on the optimal behaviour of a
short seller, and are responsible for a substantial loss of value relative to
the first-best situation without them. This has implications for many familiar
no-arbitrage identities, which are predicated on the assumption of unfettered
short selling.",Kristoffer Glover; Hardy Hulley,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11804v1,False,True,False,False,False,249.0,Christian A Hilber,Washington,Completed,2002.0,https://doi.org/10.1142/s0219024922500078,"Margin (machine learning), Economics, Recall, Arbitrage, Position (finance), Stock (firearms), Actuarial science, Value (mathematics), Microeconomics, Financial economics, Computer science, Finance, Psychology, Mechanical engineering, Machine learning, Engineering, Cognitive psychology",University of Technology Sydney,"Finance Discipline Group, University of Technology Sydney, P.

"Improving the accuracy of freight mode choice models: A case study using
  the 2017 CFS PUF data set and ensemble learning techniques","The US Census Bureau has collected two rounds of experimental data from the
Commodity Flow Survey, providing shipment-level characteristics of nationwide
commodity movements, published in 2012 (i.e., Public Use Microdata) and in 2017
(i.e., Public Use File). With this information, data-driven methods have become
increasingly valuable for understanding detailed patterns in freight logistics.
In this study, we used the 2017 Commodity Flow Survey Public Use File data set
to explore building a high-performance freight mode choice model, considering
three main improvements: (1) constructing local models for each separate
commodity/industry category; (2) extracting useful geographical features,
particularly the derived distance of each freight mode between
origin/destination zones; and (3) applying additional ensemble learning methods
such as stacking or voting to combine results from local and unified models for
improved performance. The proposed method achieved over 92% accuracy without
incorporating external information, an over 19% increase compared to directly
fitting Random Forests models over 10,000 samples. Furthermore, SHAP (Shapely
Additive Explanations) values were computed to explain the outputs and major
patterns obtained from the proposed model. The model framework could enhance

of the classifiers is compared based on prediction accuracy results. The
current research also examines the role of sample size and training-testing
data split ratios on the predictive ability of the various approaches. In
addition, the importance of variables is estimated to determine how the
variables influence freight mode choice. The results show that the tree-based
ensemble classifiers perform the best. Specifically, Random Forest produces the
most accurate predictions, closely followed by Boosting and Bagging. With

Price Impact of Health Insurance,"This paper examines the equilibrium effects of insurance contracts on
healthcare markets using a mechanism design framework. A population of
risk-averse agents with preferences as in Yaari (1987) face the risk of
developing an illness of unknown severity, which can be treated in a
competitive hospital services market at the prevailing market price. After
privately observing their health risk, but before learning their sickness
level, agents have the option to purchase insurance from a monopolistic
provider. Insurance contracts specify premiums, out-of-pocket costs (OPCs), and
hospital service coverage, thus determining demand and price in the downstream
hospital market through a market-clearing condition. Our first main result
shows that optimal insurance contracts take a simple form: agents can choose
between full hospital coverage with a high OPC or restricted coverage with a
low OPC. This highlights a novel form of under-insurance (rationing or
restricted access to healthcare services) emerging purely due to the insurer's
attempt to control his price impact. Our second key result illustrates the
nuanced effect of price impact on the amount of insurance provided. Higher
healthcare prices increase insurer payouts but also worsen agents' outside
options, making them more willing to pay for insurance ex ante. The net effect
of these forces determines whether insurance provision exceeds or falls short
of a price-taking benchmark.",Andrea Di Giovan Paolo; Jose Higueras,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01780v1,False,True,False,False,False,255.0,Susan Marquis,Washington,Completed,2004.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vhri.2019.05.005,"Procurement, Business, Social insurance, Actuarial science, Marketing, Economics, Market economy",National Institute of Science and Technology; Universitas Gadjah Mada; Pancasila University,"National Institute of Science and Technology, Jakarta, Indonesia; Division of Clinical Pharmacology and Medicine Policy, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Pancasila, Jl.

"Modelling income, wealth, and expenditure data by use of Econophysics","In the present paper, we identify several distributions from Physics and
study their applicability to phenomena such as distribution of income, wealth,

find that it fits very well the annual data for the entire income interval
including for upper income segment of population. Secondly, we apply
Fermi-Dirac distribution to these data. We seek to explain possible
correlations and analogies between economic systems and statistical
thermodynamics systems. We try to explain their behavior and properties when we
correlate physical variables with macroeconomic aggregates and indicators. Then
we draw some analogies between parameters of the Fermi-Dirac distribution and
macroeconomic variables. Thirdly, as complex systems are modeled using
polynomial distributions, we apply polynomials to the annual sets of data and
we find that it fits very well also the entire income interval. Fourthly, we
develop a new methodology to approach dynamically the income, wealth, and
expenditure distribution similarly with dynamical complex systems. This
methodology was applied to different time intervals consisting of consecutive
years up to 35 years. Finally, we develop a mathematical model based on a
Hamiltonian that maximizes utility function applied to Ramsey model using
Fermi-Dirac and polynomial utility functions. We find some theoretical

"INS-MMBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating LVLMs' Performance
  in Insurance","Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
performance in various general multimodal applications such as image
recognition and visual reasoning, and have also shown promising potential in
specialized domains. However, the application potential of LVLMs in the
insurance domain-characterized by rich application scenarios and abundant
multimodal data-has not been effectively explored. There is no systematic
review of multimodal tasks in the insurance domain, nor a benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate the capabilities of LVLMs in insurance. This
gap hinders the development of LVLMs within the insurance domain. In this
paper, we systematically review and distill multimodal tasks for four
representative types of insurance: auto insurance, property insurance, health
insurance, and agricultural insurance. We propose INS-MMBench, the first
comprehensive LVLMs benchmark tailored for the insurance domain. INS-MMBench
comprises a total of 2.2K thoroughly designed multiple-choice questions,
covering 12 meta-tasks and 22 fundamental tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate
multiple representative LVLMs, including closed-source models such as GPT-4o
and open-source models like BLIP-2. This evaluation not only validates the
effectiveness of our benchmark but also provides an in-depth performance
analysis of current LVLMs on various multimodal tasks in the insurance domain.

A return-diversification approach to portfolio selection,"In this paper, we propose a general bi-objective model for portfolio
selection, aiming to maximize both a diversification measure and the portfolio
expected return. Within this general framework, we focus on maximizing a
diversification measure recently proposed by Choueifaty and Coignard for the
case of volatility as a risk measure. We first show that the maximum
diversification approach is actually equivalent to the Risk Parity approach
using volatility under the assumption of equicorrelated assets. Then, we extend
the maximum diversification approach formulated for general risk measures.
Finally, we provide explicit formulations of our bi-objective model for
different risk measures, such as volatility, Mean Absolute Deviation,
Conditional Value-at-Risk, and Expectiles, and we present extensive
out-of-sample performance results for the portfolios obtained with our model.
The empirical analysis, based on five real-world data sets, shows that the

  City","New York City (NYC) topped the global chart for the worst air pollution in
June 2023, owing to the wildfire smoke drifting in from Canada. This
unprecedented situation caused significant travel disruptions and shifts in
traditional activity patterns of NYC residents. This study utilized large-scale
social media data to study different crisis activity concerns (i.e.,
evacuation, staying indoors, shopping, and recreational activities among
others) in the emergence of the 2023 Canadian wildfire smoke in NYC. In this
regard, one week (June 02 through June 09, 2023) geotagged Twitter data from
NYC were retrieved and used in the analysis. The tweets were processed using
advanced text classification techniques and later integrated with national
databases such as Social Security Administration data, Census, and American
Community Survey. Finally, a model has been developed to make community
inferences of different activity concerns in a major wildfire. The findings
suggest, during wildfires, females are less likely to engage in discussions
about evacuation, trips for medical, social, or recreational purposes, and
commuting for work, likely influenced by workplaces maintaining operations
despite poor air quality. There were also racial disparities in these
discussions, with Asians being more likely than Hispanics to discuss evacuation
and work commute, and African Americans being less likely to discuss social and
recreational activities. Additionally, individuals from low-income

multiple specifications, by at least 1.5 percentage points. The timing and
magnitude of the post-law increases in FLFP differ across the two datasets. I
bolster the analyses using the CDC's Infant Feeding Practices Survey and the
Childhood and Adoption Supplement to the PSID, which further suggest an
influence of the laws on breastfeeding women. Heterogeneity analysis indicates
the presence of substantial treatment effect heterogeneity across subgroups,
but the findings are specific to the separate datasets. Across both datasets,
the legislation appears to be more effective in states where average pre-law
FLFP was comparatively low. I also find evidence of a negative spillover

IndoFashion : Apparel Classification for Indian Ethnic Clothes,"Cloth categorization is an important research problem that is used by
e-commerce websites for displaying correct products to the end-users. Indian
clothes have a large number of clothing categories both for men and women. The
traditional Indian clothes like ""Saree"" and ""Dhoti"" are worn very differently
from western clothes like t-shirts and jeans. Moreover, the style and patterns
of ethnic clothes have a very different distribution from western outfits. Thus
the models trained on standard cloth datasets fail miserably on ethnic outfits.
To address these challenges, we introduce the first large-scale ethnic dataset

classification of Indian ethnic clothes. We gathered a diverse dataset from a
large number of Indian e-commerce websites. We then evaluate several baselines

"Evaluation of the Impact of Low-Emission Zone: Madrid Central as a Case
  Study","Air-quality in urban areas and its relation with public health is one of the
most critical concerns for governments. For this reason, they implement actions
aimed at reducing the concentration of the most critical atmospheric
pollutants, among others the implementation of Low-Emission Zones. Madrid
Central is a major initiative of Madrid city council for reducing motor traffic
and the associated air pollution at the city center. It is created by enlarging
a previous and smaller area of restricted motor traffic. This initiative starts
at the end of 2018, but the first fully-operational period corresponds to
2019Q2 (second quarter of 2019). The activation of Low-Emission Zones has
social and economic impacts, besides environmental ones. For this reason, their
impact must be assessed to ensure the achievement of the commitments in the
reduction of atmospheric pollutants levels. In this work, two metrics for
evaluating the impact of Madrid Central in the reduction of nitrogen dioxide
concentration are proposed. Mean daily concentrations of NO2 from 2010 to 2019
corresponding to the Plaza del Carmen monitoring station are employed for the
evaluation of the impact of Madrid Central. Two other monitoring stations
around Madrid Central are analysed for ascertaining the rise of detrimental
effects due to an increment of the motor traffic around the traffic restricted

"Effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on urban light emissions: ground and
  satellite comparison","'Lockdown' periods in response to COVID-19 have provided a unique opportunity
to study the impacts of economic activity on environmental pollution (e.g.
NO$_2$, aerosols, noise, light). The effects on NO$_2$ and aerosols have been
very noticeable and readily demonstrated, but that on light pollution has
proven challenging to determine. The main reason for this difficulty is that
the primary source of nighttime satellite imagery of the earth is the
SNPP-VIIRS/DNB instrument, which acquires data late at night after most human
nocturnal activity has already occurred and much associated lighting has been
turned off. Here, to analyze the effect of lockdown on urban light emissions,
we use ground and satellite data for Granada, Spain, during the COVID-19
induced confinement of the city's population from March 14 until May 31, 2020.
We find a clear decrease in light pollution due both to a decrease in light
emissions from the city and to a decrease in anthropogenic aerosol content in
the atmosphere which resulted in less light being scattered. A clear
correlation between the abundance of PM10 particles and sky brightness is
observed, such that the more polluted the atmosphere the brighter the urban
night sky. An empirical expression is determined that relates PM10 particle
abundance and sky brightness at three different wavelength bands.",Máximo Bustamante-Calabria; Alejandro Sánchez de Miguel; Susana Martín-Ruiz; Jose-Luis Ortiz; J. M.

"Integrated Reference Cavity for Dual-mode Optical Thermometry and
  Frequency Stabilization","Optical frequency stabilization is a critical component for precision
scientific systems including quantum sensing, precision metrology, and atomic
timekeeping. Ultra-high quality factor photonic integrated optical resonators
are a prime candidate for reducing their size, weight and cost as well as
moving these systems on chip. However, integrated resonators suffer from
temperature-dependent resonance drift due to the large thermal response as well
as sensitivity to external environmental perturbations. Suppression of the
cavity resonance drift can be achieved using precision interrogation of the
cavity temperature through the dual-mode optical thermometry. This approach
enables measurement of the cavity temperature change by detecting the resonance
difference shift between two polarization or optical frequency modes. Yet this
approach has to date only been demonstrated in bulk-optic whispering gallery
mode and fiber resonators. In this paper, we implement dual-mode optical
thermometry using dual polarization modes in a silicon nitride waveguide
resonator for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. The temperature
responsivity and sensitivity of the dual-mode TE/TM resonance difference is
180.7$\pm$2.5 MHz/K and 82.56 $\mu$K, respectively, in a silicon nitride
resonator with a 179.9E6 intrinsic TM mode Q factor and a 26.6E6 intrinsic TE
mode Q factor. Frequency stabilization is demonstrated by locking a laser to
the TM mode cavity resonance and applying the dual-mode resonance difference to
a feedforward laser frequency drift correction circuit with a drift rate
improvement to 0.31 kHz/s over the uncompensated 10.03 kHz/s drift rate. Allan
deviation measurements with dual-mode feedforward-correction engaged shows that
a fractional frequency instability of 9.6E-11 over 77 s can be achieved.",Qiancheng Zhao; Mark W. Harrington; Andrei Isichenko; Ryan O. Behunin; Scott B. Papp; Peter T. Rakich; Chad W.

Scientific Talent Leaks Out of Funding Gaps,"We study how delays in NIH grant funding affect the career outcomes of
research personnel. Using comprehensive earnings and tax records linked to
university transaction data along with a difference-in-differences design, we
find that a funding interruption of more than 30 days has a substantial effect
on job placements for personnel who work in labs with a single NIH R01 research
grant, including a 3 percentage point (40%) increase in the probability of not
working in the US. Incorporating information from the full 2020 Decennial
Census and data on publications, we find that about half of those induced into
nonemployment appear to permanently leave the US and are 90% less likely to
publish in a given year, with even larger impacts for trainees (postdocs and
graduate students). Among personnel who continue to work in the US, we find
that interrupted personnel earn 20% less than their continuously-funded peers,

on stubs (half-edges), has orders of magnitude greater discerning power
(ability to tell non-isomorphic graphs apart) than any other descriptor in this

does not come at a commensurate cost in storage space or computation power. We

"The 2020 United States Decennial Census Is More Private Than You (Might)
  Think","The U.S. Decennial Census serves as the foundation for many high-profile
policy decision-making processes, including federal funding allocation and
redistricting. In 2020, the Census Bureau adopted differential privacy to
protect the confidentiality of individual responses through a disclosure
avoidance system that injects noise into census data tabulations. The Bureau
subsequently posed an open question: Could stronger privacy guarantees be
obtained for the 2020 U.S. Census compared to their published guarantees, or
equivalently, had the privacy budgets been fully utilized?
  In this paper, we address this question affirmatively by demonstrating that
the 2020 U.S. Census provides significantly stronger privacy protections than
its nominal guarantees suggest at each of the eight geographical levels, from
the national level down to the block level. This finding is enabled by our
precise tracking of privacy losses using $f$-differential privacy, applied to
the composition of private queries across these geographical levels. Our
analysis reveals that the Census Bureau introduced unnecessarily high levels of
noise to meet the specified privacy guarantees for the 2020 Census.
Consequently, we show that noise variances could be reduced by $15.08\%$ to
$24.82\%$ while maintaining nearly the same level of privacy protection for
each geographical level, thereby improving the accuracy of privatized census
statistics. We empirically demonstrate that reducing noise injection into
census statistics mitigates distortion caused by privacy constraints in
downstream applications of private census data, illustrated through a study
examining the relationship between earnings and education.",Buxin Su; Weijie J.

"Differential Privacy in the 2020 Decennial Census and the Implications
  for Available Data Products","In early 2021, the US Census Bureau will begin releasing statistical tables
based on the decennial census conducted in 2020. Because of significant changes
in the data landscape, the Census Bureau is changing its approach to disclosure
avoidance. The confidentiality of individuals represented ""anonymously"" in
these statistical tables will be protected by a ""formal privacy"" technique that
allows the Bureau to mathematically assess the risk of revealing information
about individuals in the released statistical tables. The Bureau's approach is
an implementation of ""differential privacy,"" and it gives a rigorously
demonstrated guaranteed level of privacy protection that traditional methods of
disclosure avoidance do not. Given the importance of the Census Bureau's
statistical tables to democracy, resource allocation, justice, and research,
confusion about what differential privacy is and how it might alter or
eliminate data products has rippled through the community of its data users,
namely: demographers, statisticians, and census advocates.
  The purpose of this primer is to provide context to the Census Bureau's

"Idle Vehicle Relocation Strategy through Deep Learning for Shared
  Autonomous Electric Vehicle System Optimization","In optimization of a shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) system, idle
vehicle relocation strategies are important to reduce operation costs and
customers' wait time. However, for an on-demand service, continuous
optimization for idle vehicle relocation is computationally expensive, and
thus, not effective. This study proposes a deep learning-based algorithm that
can instantly predict the optimal solution to idle vehicle relocation problems
under various traffic conditions. The proposed relocation process comprises
three steps. First, a deep learning-based passenger demand prediction model
using taxi big data is built. Second, idle vehicle relocation problems are
solved based on predicted demands, and optimal solution data are collected.
Finally, a deep learning model using the optimal solution data is built to
estimate the optimal strategy without solving relocation. In addition, the
proposed idle vehicle relocation model is validated by applying it to optimize
the SAEV system. We present an optimal service system including the design of
SAEV vehicles and charging stations. Further, we demonstrate that the proposed
strategy can drastically reduce operation costs and wait times for on-demand

"Interpolating Population Distributions using Public-use Data: An
  Application to Income Segregation using American Community Survey Data","Income segregation measures the extent to which households choose to live
near other households with similar incomes. Sociologists theorize that income
segregation can exacerbate the impacts of income inequality, and have developed
indices to measure it at the metro area level, including the information theory
index introduced in \citet{reardon2011income}, and the divergence index
presented in \citet{roberto2015divergence}. To study their differences, we
construct both indices using recent American Community Survey (ACS) estimates
of features of the income distribution. Since the elimination of the decennial
census long form, methods of computing these estimates must be updated to use
ACS estimates and account for survey error. We propose a model-based method to
interpolate estimates of features of the income distribution that accounts for
this error. This method improves on previous approaches by allowing for the use
of more types of estimates, and by providing uncertainty quantification. We
apply this method to estimate U.S. census tract-level income distributions
using ACS tabulations, and in turn use these to construct both income
segregation indices. We find major differences between the two indices in the
relative ranking of metro areas, as well as differences in how both indices
correlate with the Gini index.",Matthew Simpson; Scott H. Holan; Christopher K. Wikle; Jonathan R.

"Addressing Census data problems in race imputation via fully Bayesian
  Improved Surname Geocoding and name supplements","Prediction of individual's race and ethnicity plays an important role in
social science and public health research. Examples include studies of racial
disparity in health and voting. Recently, Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding
(BISG), which uses Bayes' rule to combine information from Census surname files
with the geocoding of an individual's residence, has emerged as a leading
methodology for this prediction task. Unfortunately, BISG suffers from two
Census data problems that contribute to unsatisfactory predictive performance
for minorities. First, the decennial Census often contains zero counts for
minority racial groups in the Census blocks where some members of those groups
reside. Second, because the Census surname files only include frequent names,
many surnames -- especially those of minorities -- are missing from the list.
To address the zero counts problem, we introduce a fully Bayesian Improved
Surname Geocoding (fBISG) methodology that accounts for potential measurement
error in Census counts by extending the naive Bayesian inference of the BISG
methodology to full posterior inference. To address the missing surname
problem, we supplement the Census surname data with additional data on last,
first, and middle names taken from the voter files of six Southern states where
self-reported race is available. Our empirical validation shows that the fBISG
methodology and name supplements significantly improve the accuracy of race
imputation across all racial groups, and especially for Asians. The proposed
methodology, together with additional name data, is available via the
open-source software WRU.",Kosuke Imai; Santiago Olivella; Evan T. R.

empirical analysis of US census data from the period between 1960 and 2015: we
show that controlling for the variations in the trait distributions adequately

"Algorithmic Inheritance: Surname Bias in AI Decisions Reinforces
  Intergenerational Inequality","Surnames often convey implicit markers of social status, wealth, and lineage,
shaping perceptions in ways that can perpetuate systemic biases and
intergenerational inequality. This study is the first of its kind to
investigate whether and how surnames influence AI-driven decision-making,
focusing on their effects across key areas such as hiring recommendations,
leadership appointments, and loan approvals. Using 72,000 evaluations of 600
surnames from the United States and Thailand, two countries with distinct
sociohistorical contexts and surname conventions, we classify names into four
categories: Rich, Legacy, Normal, and phonetically similar Variant groups. Our
findings show that elite surnames consistently increase AI-generated
perceptions of power, intelligence, and wealth, which in turn influence
AI-driven decisions in high-stakes contexts. Mediation analysis reveals
perceived intelligence as a key mechanism through which surname biases
influence AI decision-making process. While providing objective qualifications
alongside surnames mitigates most of these biases, it does not eliminate them
entirely, especially in contexts where candidate credentials are low. These
findings highlight the need for fairness-aware algorithms and robust policy
measures to prevent AI systems from reinforcing systemic inequalities tied to
surnames, an often-overlooked bias compared to more salient characteristics
such as race and gender. Our work calls for a critical reassessment of
algorithmic accountability and its broader societal impact, particularly in

invariance under swapping and voter file racial identification, better
approximating a comparison with the ground truth. Lastly, we show that accurate
statistical predictions of individual race based on the Bayesian Improved
Surname Geocoding, while not a violation of differential privacy, substantially
increases the disclosure risk of private information the Census Bureau sought

"The Impact of De-Identification on Single-Year-of-Age Counts in the U.S.
  Census","In 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau transitioned from data swapping to
differential privacy (DP) in its approach to de-identifying decennial census
data. This decision has faced considerable criticism from data users,
particularly due to concerns about the accuracy of DP. We compare the relative
impacts of swapping and DP on census data, focusing on the use case of school
planning, where single-year-of-age population counts (i.e., the number of
four-year-olds in the district) are used to estimate the number of incoming
students and make resulting decisions surrounding faculty, classrooms, and
funding requests. We examine these impacts for school districts of varying
population sizes and age distributions.
  Our findings support the use of DP over swapping for single-year-of-age
counts; in particular, concerning behaviors associated with DP (namely, poor
behavior for smaller districts) occur with swapping mechanisms as well. For the
school planning use cases we investigate, DP provides comparable, if not
improved, accuracy over swapping, while offering other benefits such as
improved transparency.",Sarah Radway; Miranda Christ,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12876v1,True,True,False,False,True,335.0,Fernando V Ferreira,Berkeley,Completed,2006.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2308.12876,"Census, Transparency (behavior), Geography, Population, Identification (biology), Demography, Computer science, Statistics, Mathematics, Computer security, Sociology, Botany, Biology",,,
A Tale of Two Mechanisms: Incentivizing Investments in Security Games,"In a system of interdependent users, the security of an entity is affected
not only by that user's investment in security measures, but also by the
positive externality of the security decisions of (some of) the other users.
The provision of security in such system is therefore modeled as a public good
provision problem, and is referred to as a security game. In this paper, we
compare two well-known incentive mechanisms in this context for incentivizing
optimal security investments among users, namely the Pivotal and the
Externality mechanisms. The taxes in a Pivotal mechanism are designed to ensure
users' voluntary participation, while those in an Externality mechanism are
devised to maintain a balanced budget. We first show the more general result
that, due to the non-excludable nature of security, no mechanism can
incentivize the socially optimal investment profile, while at the same time
ensuring voluntary participation and maintaining a balanced budget for all
instances of security games. To further illustrate, we apply the Pivotal and
Externality mechanisms to the special case of weighted total effort
interdependence models, and identify some of the effects of varying
interdependency between users on the budget deficit in the Pivotal mechanism,
as well as on the participation incentives in the Externality mechanism.",Parinaz Naghizadeh; Mingyan Liu,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07377v1,False,True,False,False,False,347.0,Jhih-shyang Shih,Washington,Completed,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1503.07377,"Externality, Incentive, Excludability, Interdependence, Microeconomics, Mechanism (biology), Context (archaeology), Mechanism design, Investment (military), Public good, Game theory, Economics, Business, Public economics, Paleontology, Philosophy, Epistemology, Politics, Political science, Law, Biology",University of Michigan–Ann Arbor,(University of Michigan),(University of Michigan)
"Effects of the Affordable Care Act Dependent Coverage Mandate on Health
  Insurance Coverage for Individuals in Same-Sex Couples","A large body of research documents that the 2010 dependent coverage mandate
of the Affordable Care Act was responsible for significantly increasing health
insurance coverage among young adults. No prior research has examined whether
sexual minority young adults also benefitted from the dependent coverage
mandate, despite previous studies showing lower health insurance coverage among
sexual minorities and the fact that their higher likelihood of strained
relationships with their parents might predict a lower ability to use parental
coverage. Our estimates from the American Community Surveys using
difference-in-differences and event study models show that men in same-sex
couples age 21-25 were significantly more likely to have any health insurance
after 2010 compared to the associated change for slightly older 27 to
31-year-old men in same-sex couples. This increase is concentrated among
employer-sponsored insurance, and it is robust to permutations of time periods
and age groups. Effects for women in same-sex couples and men in different-sex
couples are smaller than the associated effects for men in same-sex couples.
These findings confirm the broad effects of expanded dependent coverage and
suggest that eliminating the federal dependent mandate could reduce health
insurance coverage among young adult sexual minorities in same-sex couples.",Christopher S.

Price and capacity competition in balancing markets with energy storage,"Energy storage can absorb variability from the rising number of wind and
solar power producers. Storage is different from the conventional generators
that have traditionally balanced supply and demand on fast time scales due to
its hard energy capacity constraints, dynamic coupling, and low marginal costs.
These differences are leading system operators to propose new mechanisms for
enabling storage to participate in reserve and real-time energy markets. The
persistence of market power and gaming in electricity markets suggests that
these changes will expose new vulnerabilities.
  We develop a new model of strategic behavior among storages in energy
balancing markets. Our model is a two-stage game that generalizes a classic
model of capacity followed by Bertrand-Edgeworth price competition by
explicitly modeling storage dynamics and uncertainty in the pricing stage. By
applying the model to balancing markets with storage, we are able to compare
capacity and energy-based pricing schemes, and to analyze the dynamic effects
of the market horizon and energy losses due to leakage. Our first key finding
is that capacity pricing leads to higher prices and higher capacity
commitments, and that energy pricing leads to lower, randomized prices and
lower capacity commitments. Second, we find that a longer market horizon and
higher physical efficiencies lead to lower prices by inducing the storage to
compete to have their states of charge cycled more frequently.",Josh A. Taylor; Johanna L. Mathieu; Duncan S.

"The Growing US-Mexico Natural Gas Trade and Its Regional Economic
  Impacts in Mexico","With the recent administration change in Mexico, the fluctuations in national
energy policy have generated widespread concerns among investors and the
public. The debate centers around Mexico's energy dependence on the US and how
Mexico's energy development should move forward. The goal of this study is
two-fold. We first review the history and background of the recent energy
reforms in Mexico. The focus of the study is on quantifying the state-level
regional economic impact of the growing US-Mexico natural gas trade in Mexico.
We examine both the quantity effect (impact of import volume) and the price
effect (impact of natural gas price changes). Our empirical analysis adopts a
fixed-effects regression model and the instrumental variables (IV) estimation
approach to address spatial heterogeneities and the potential endogeneity
associated with natural gas import. The quantity effect analysis suggests a
statistically significant positive employment impact of imports in non-mining
sectors. The impact in the mining sector, however, is insignificant. The
state-level average (non-mining) employment impact is 127 jobs per million MCFs
of natural gas imported from the US. The price effect analysis suggests a
statistically significant positive employment impact of price increases in the
mining sector. A one-percentage increase in natural gas price (1.82 Pesos/GJ,
in 2015 Peso) leads to an average state-level mining employment increase of 140
(or 2.38%). We also explored the implications of our findings for Mexico's
energy policy, trade policy, and energy security.",Haoying Wang; Rafael Garduno Rivera,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06928v1,False,True,False,False,False,355.0,Joshua Linn,Chicago,Completed,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4190064,"Natural gas, Natural (archaeology), Economics, International trade, Geography, Natural resource economics, Engineering, Waste management, Archaeology",New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology; Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas,New Mexico Tech; Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE),New Mexico Tech; Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE)
"Big Pharma, little science? A bibliometric perspective on big pharma's
  R&D decline","There is a widespread perception that pharmaceutical R&D is facing a
productivity crisis characterised by stagnation in the numbers of new drug
approvals in the face of increasing R&D costs. This study explores
pharmaceutical R&D dynamics by examining the publication activities of all R&D
laboratories of the major European and US pharmaceutical firms during the
period 1995-2009. The empirical findings present an industry in
transformation.In the first place, we observe a decline of the total number of
publications by large firms. Second, we show a relative increase of their
external collaborations suggesting a tendency to outsource, and a
diversification of the disciplinary base, in particular towards computation,
health services and more clinical approaches. Also evident is a more pronounced
decline in publications by both R&D laboratories located in Europe and by firms
with European headquarters. Finally, while publications by Big Pharma in
emerging economies sharply increase, they remain extremely low compared with
those in developed countries. In summary, the trend in this transformation is
one of a gradual decrease in internal research efforts and increasing reliance
on external research. These empirical insights support the view that large
pharmaceutical firms are increasingly becoming networks integrators rather than
the prime locus of drug discovery.",Ismael Rafols; Michael M. Hopkins; Jarno Hoekman; Josh Siepel; Alice O'Hare; Antonio Perianes-Rodriguez; Paul Nightingale,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0947v1,False,True,False,False,False,361.0,Yukako Ono,Chicago,Completed,2011.0,,No keywords found,,,
The Network of Inter-Regional Direct Investment Stocks across Europe,"We propose a methodological framework to study the dynamics of inter-regional
investment flow in Europe from a Complex Networks perspective, an approach with
recent proven success in many fields including economics. In this work we study
the network of investment stocks in Europe at two different levels: first, we
compute the inward-outward investment stocks at the level of firms, based on
ownership shares and number of employees; then we estimate the inward-outward
investment stock at the level of regions in Europe, by aggregating the
ownership network of firms, based on their headquarter location. Despite the
intuitive value of this approach for EU policy making in economic development,
to our knowledge there are no similar works in the literature yet. In this
paper we focus on statistical distributions and scaling laws of activity,
investment stock and connectivity degree both at the level of firms and at the
level of regions. In particular we find that investment stock of firms is power
law distributed with an exponent very close to the one found for firm activity.
On the other hand investment stock and activity of regions turn out to be
log-normal distributed. At both levels we find scaling laws relating investment
to activity and connectivity. In particular, we find that investment stock
scales with connectivity in a similar way as has been previously found for
stock market data, calling for further investigations on a possible general
scaling law holding true in economical networks.",Stefano Battiston; João F.

"A Statistical Field Perspective on Capital Allocation and Accumulation:
  Individual dynamics","We have shown, in a series of articles, that a classical description of a
large number of economic agents can be replaced by a statistical fields
formalism. To better understand the accumulation and allocation of capital
among different sectors, the present paper applies this statistical fields
description to a large number of heterogeneous agents divided into two groups.
The first group is composed of a large number of firms in different sectors
that collectively own the entire physical capital. The second group, investors,
holds the entire financial capital and allocates it between firms across
sectors according to investment preferences, expected returns, and stock prices
variations on financial markets. In return, firms pay dividends to their
investors. Financial capital is thus a function of dividends and stock
valuations, whereas physical capital is a function of the total capital
allocated by the financial sector. Whereas our previous work focused on the
background fields that describe potential long-term equilibria, here we compute
the transition functions of individual agents and study their probabilistic
dynamics in the background field, as a function of their initial state. We show
that capital accumulation depends on various factors. The probability
associated with each firm's trajectories is the result of several contradictory
effects: the firm tends to shift towards sectors with the greatest long-term
return, but must take into account the impact of its shift on its
attractiveness for investors throughout its trajectory. Since this trajectory
depends largely on the average capital of transition sectors, a firm's
attractiveness during its relocation depends on the relative level of capital
in those sectors. Thus, an under-capitalized firm reaching a high-capital
sector will experience a loss of attractiveness, and subsequently, in
investors. Moreover, the firm must also consider the effects of competition in
the intermediate sectors. An under-capitalized firm will tend to be ousted out
towards sectors with lower average capital, while an over-capitalized firm will
tend to shift towards higher averagecapital sectors. For investors, capital
allocation depends on their short and long-term returns. These returns are not
independent: in the short-term, returns are composed of both the firm's
dividends and the increase in its stock prices. In the long-term, returns are
based on the firm's growth expectations, but also, indirectly, on expectations
of higher stock prices. Investors' capital allocation directly depends on the
volatility of stock prices and {\ldots}rms'dividends. Investors will tend to
reallocate their capital to maximize their short and long-term returns. The
higher their level of capital, the stronger the reallocation will be.",Pierre Gosselin; Aïleen Lotz,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06142v1,False,True,False,False,False,369.0,Andrea L Eisfeldt,Chicago,Completed,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2401.06142,"Physical capital, Dividend, Economics, Stock (firearms), Relocation, Financial economics, Capital (architecture), Investment (military), Rate of return, Finance, Human capital, Market economy, Mechanical engineering, Archaeology, Politics, Computer science, Law, Political science, Engineering, History, Programming language",Institut Fourier,"IF - Institut Fourier (100, rue des maths 38610 Gières  - France); Cerca Trova (BP 114, 38001 Grenoble Cedex 1 - France)","IF - Institut Fourier (100, rue des maths 38610 Gières  - France); Cerca Trova (BP 114, 38001 Grenoble Cedex 1 - France)"
The Future of Work and Capital: Analyzing AGI in a CES Production Model,"The integration of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) into economic
production represents a transformative shift with profound implications for
labor markets, income distribution, and technological growth. This study
extends the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function to
incorporate AGI-driven labor and capital alongside traditional inputs,
providing a comprehensive framework for analyzing AGI's economic impact.
  Four key models emerge from this framework. First, we examine the
substitution and complementarity between AGI labor and human labor, identifying
conditions under which AGI augments or displaces human workers. Second, we
analyze how AGI capital accumulation influences wage structures and income
distribution, highlighting potential disruptions to labor-based earnings.
Third, we explore long-run equilibrium dynamics, demonstrating how an economy
dominated by AGI capital may lead to the collapse of human wages and
necessitate redistributive mechanisms. Finally, we assess the impact of AGI on
total factor productivity, showing that technological growth depends on whether
AGI serves as a complement to or a substitute for human labor.
  Our findings underscore the urgent need for policy interventions to ensure
economic stability and equitable wealth distribution in an AGI-driven economy.
Without appropriate regulatory measures, rising inequality and weakened
aggregate demand could lead to economic stagnation despite technological
advancements. Moreover this research suggests a renegoation of the Social

Covert Cycle Stealing in a Single FIFO Server,"Consider a setting where Willie generates a Poisson stream of jobs and routes
them to a single server that follows the first-in first-out discipline. Suppose

covertly, i.e. without being detected by Willie? In the case where both Willie

$\mu_2$, we demonstrate a phase-transition when Alice adopts the strategy of
inserting a single job probabilistically when the server idles : over $n$ busy
periods, she can achieve a covert throughput, measured by the expected number
of jobs covertly inserted, of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$ when $\mu_1 < 2\mu_2$,
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n/\log n})$ when $\mu_1 = 2\mu_2$, and
$\mathcal{O}(n^{\mu_2/\mu_1})$ when $\mu_1 > 2\mu_2$. When both Willie and

"Regional economic integration via detection of circular flow in
  international value-added network","Global value chains (GVCs) are formed through value-added trade, and some
regions promote economic integration by concluding regional trade agreements to
promote these chains. However, there is no way to quantitatively assess the
scope and extent of economic integration involving various sectors in multiple
countries. In this study, we used the World Input--Output Database to create a
cross-border sector-wise trade in value-added network (international
value-added network (IVAN)) covering the period of 2000--2014 and evaluated
them using network science methods. By applying Infomap to the IVAN, we
confirmed for the first time the existence of two regional communities: Europe
and the Pacific Rim. Helmholtz--Hodge decomposition was used to decompose the
value flows within the region into potential and circular flows, and the annual
evolution of the potential and circular relationships between countries and
sectors was clarified. The circular flow component of the decomposition was
used to define an economic integration index, and findings confirmed that the
degree of economic integration in Europe declined sharply after the economic
crisis in 2009 to a level lower than that in the Pacific Rim. The European
economic integration index recovered in 2011 but again fell below that of the
Pacific Rim in 2013. Moreover, sectoral analysis showed that the economic
integration index captured the effect of Russian mineral resources, free

"Weathering the Storm: How Foreign Aid and Institutions Affect

activity following natural disasters. We use insights from the
entrepreneurship, development, and institutions literature to develop a model
of entrepreneurship activity in the aftermath of natural disasters. First, we
hypothesize the effect of natural disasters on entrepreneurship activity
depends on the amount of foreign aid received. Second, we hypothesize that
natural disasters and foreign aid either encourages or discourages
entrepreneurship activity depending on two important institutional conditions:
the quality of government and economic freedom. The findings from our panel of
85 countries from 2006 to 2016 indicate that natural disasters are negatively
associated with entrepreneurship activity, but both foreign aid and economic
freedom attenuate this effect. In addition, we observe that foreign aid is
positively associated with entrepreneurship activity but only in countries with
high quality government. Hence, we conclude that the effect of natural
disasters on entrepreneurship depends crucially on the quality of government,

"Rock, Rap, or Reggaeton?: Assessing Mexican Immigrants' Cultural
  Assimilation Using Facebook Data","The degree to which Mexican immigrants in the U.S. are assimilating
culturally has been widely debated. To examine this question, we focus on
musical taste, a key symbolic resource that signals the social positions of
individuals. We adapt an assimilation metric from earlier work to analyze
self-reported musical interests among immigrants in Facebook. We use the
relative levels of interest in musical genres, where a similarity to the host
population in musical preferences is treated as evidence of cultural
assimilation. Contrary to skeptics of Mexican assimilation, we find significant
cultural convergence even among first-generation immigrants, which
problematizes their use as assimilative ""benchmarks"" in the literature.
Further, 2nd generation Mexican Americans show high cultural convergence
vis-\`a-vis both Anglos and African-Americans, with the exception of those who

"Intergenerational transmission of culture among immigrants: Gender gap
  in education among first and second generations","This paper illustrates the intergenerational transmission of the gender gap
in education among first and second-generation immigrants. Using the Current
Population Survey (1994-2018), we find that the difference in female-male
education persists from the home country to the new environment. A one standard
deviation increase of the ancestral country female-male difference in schooling
is associated with 17.2% and 2.5% of a standard deviation increase in the
gender gap among first and second generations, respectively. Since gender
perspective in education uncovers a new channel for cultural transmission among
families, we interpret the findings as evidence of cultural persistence among
first generations and partial cultural assimilation of second generations.
Moreover, Disaggregation into country-groups reveals different paths for this
transmission: descendants of immigrants of lower-income countries show fewer
attachments to the gender opinions of their home country. Average local
education of natives can facilitate the acculturation process. Immigrants
residing in states with higher education reveal a lower tendency to follow
their home country attitudes regarding the gender gap.",Hamid NoghaniBehambari; Nahid Tavassoli; Farzaneh Noghani,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05364v1,False,True,False,False,False,401.0,Anna Paulson,Chicago,Completed,2011.0,https://doi.org/10.1453/jepe.v7i4.2145,"Immigration, Demographic economics, Human capital, Acculturation, Cultural transmission in animals, Cultural capital, Cultural assimilation, Perspective (graphical), Population, Educational attainment, Sociology, Demography, Geography, Economics, Economic growth, Biology, Social science, Archaeology, Artificial intelligence, Computer science, Genetics",Texas Tech University,"Jerry S.

"Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Hedonic Methods for Real Estate
  Price Prediction","In recent years several complaints about racial discrimination in appraising
home values have been accumulating. For several decades, to estimate the sale
price of the residential properties, appraisers have been walking through the
properties, observing the property, collecting data, and making use of the
hedonic pricing models. However, this method bears some costs and by nature is
subjective and biased. To minimize human involvement and the biases in the real
estate appraisals and boost the accuracy of the real estate market price
prediction models, in this research we design data-efficient learning machines
capable of learning and extracting the relation or patterns between the inputs
(features for the house) and output (value of the houses). We compare the
performance of some machine learning and deep learning algorithms, specifically
artificial neural networks, random forest, and k nearest neighbor approaches to
that of hedonic method on house price prediction in the city of Boulder,
Colorado. Even though this study has been done over the houses in the city of
Boulder it can be generalized to the housing market in any cities. The results
indicate non-linear association between the dwelling features and dwelling
prices. In light of these findings, this study demonstrates that random forest

hedonic regression analysis for prediction of the house prices in the city of

"Designing User-Centered Simulations of Leadership Situations for Cave
  Automatic Virtual Environments: Development and Usability Study","Given that experience is a pivotal dimension of learning processes in the
field of leadership, the ongoing and unresolved issue is how such experiential
moments could be provided when developing leadership skills and competencies.
Role-plays and business simulations are widely used in this context as they are
said to teach relevant social leadership skills, like those required by
everyday communication to followers, by decision-making on compensation,
evaluating performance, dealing with conflicts, or terminating contracts.
However, the effectiveness of simulations can highly vary depending on the
counterpart's ability to act in the given scenarios. In our project, we deal
with how immersive media could create experiential learning based on
simulations for leadership development. In recent years different variations of
extended reality got significant technological improvements. Head-mounted
displays are an easy and cost-efficient way to present high-resolution virtual
environments. For groups of people that are part of an immersive experience,
cave automatic virtual environments offer an excellent trade-off between actual
exchange with other humans and interaction with virtual content simultaneously.
The work presented is based on developing a user-centered simulation of
leadership situations for cave automatic virtual environments and includes the
results of a first usability study. In the future, the presented results can
help to support the development and evaluation of simulated situations for cave
automatic virtual environments with an emphasis on leadership-related

Job Posting-Enriched Knowledge Graph for Skills-based Matching,"The labor market is constantly evolving. Occupations are changing, being
added, or disappearing to fit the needs of today's market. In recent years the
pace of this change has accelerated, due to factors such as globalization,
digitization, and the shift to working from home. Different factors are
relevant when selecting employment, e.g., cultural fit, compensation, provided
degree of freedom. To successfully fulfill an occupation the gap between
required (by the job) and possessed (by the job seeker) skills needs to be as
small as possible. Decreasing this skill-gap improves the fit between a job
candidate and occupation. In this paper we propose a custom-built Skills &
Occupation Knowledge Graph (KG) that fits the above described dynamic nature of
the labor market, by leveraging existing skills and occupation taxonomies
enriched with external job posting data. We leverage this KG and explore
several applications for skills-based matching of jobs to job seekers. First,
we study link prediction as a means to quantify relevance of skills to
occupations, which can help in prioritizing learning and development of
employees. Next, we study node similarity methods and shortest path algorithms
for career pathfinding. Finally, we leverage a term weighting method for
identifying which skills are most ""distinctive"" for different (types of)
occupations.",Maurits de Groot; Jelle Schutte; David Graus,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02554v1,False,True,False,False,False,429.0,Andrew K Hildreth,Berkeley,Completed,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2109.02554,"Knowledge graph, Matching (statistics), Computer science, Graph, Information retrieval, Knowledge management, Business, Mathematics, Theoretical computer science, Statistics",,,
"Convergence-aware Clustered Federated Graph Learning Framework for
  Collaborative Inter-company Labor Market Forecasting","Labor market forecasting on talent demand and supply is essential for
business management and economic development. With accurate and timely
forecasts, employers can adapt their recruitment strategies to align with the
evolving labor market, and employees can have proactive career path planning
according to future demand and supply. However, previous studies ignore the
interconnection between demand-supply sequences among different companies and
positions for predicting variations. Moreover, companies are reluctant to share
their private human resource data for global labor market analysis due to
concerns over jeopardizing competitive advantage, security threats, and
potential ethical or legal violations. To this end, in this paper, we formulate
the Federated Labor Market Forecasting (FedLMF) problem and propose a
Meta-personalized Convergence-aware Clustered Federated Learning (MPCAC-FL)
framework to provide accurate and timely collaborative talent demand and supply
prediction in a privacy-preserving way. First, we design a graph-based
sequential model to capture the inherent correlation between demand and supply
sequences and company-position pairs. Second, we adopt meta-learning techniques
to learn effective initial model parameters that can be shared across
companies, allowing personalized models to be optimized for forecasting
company-specific demand and supply, even when companies have heterogeneous
data. Third, we devise a Convergence-aware Clustering algorithm to dynamically
divide companies into groups according to model similarity and apply federated
aggregation in each group. The heterogeneity can be alleviated for more stable
convergence and better performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MPCAC-FL outperforms compared baselines on three real-world datasets and
achieves over 97% of the state-of-the-art model, i.e., DH-GEM, without exposing
private company data.",Zhuoning Guo; Hao Liu; Le Zhang; Qi Zhang; Hengshu Zhu; Hui Xiong,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19545v1,False,True,False,False,False,429.0,Andrew K Hildreth,Berkeley,Completed,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2409.19545,"Convergence (economics), Computer science, Graph, Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Business, Industrial organization, Theoretical computer science, Economics, Economic growth",,,
"Implications of Environmental Uncertainty for Business-IT Alignment: A
  Comparative Study of SMEs and Large Organizations","This paper presents a comprehensive study of the influence of environmental
uncertainty on business-IT alignment. The existing literature postulates
environmental uncertainty as a key challenge to achieving business-IT
alignment. Hence, the first objective of this study is to identify the extent
of the impact of environmental uncertainty on business-IT alignment, and to
determine its relative impact in the light of the other antecedents.
Furthermore, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) differ fundamentally
from large firms in many ways. Thus this paper also aims to investigate the
variation between SMEs and large firms with regard to the antecedents for
strategic alignment. Based on data collected from 212 firms, a conceptual model
is tested against the research objectives. The findings provide important
contributions to both research and practice by demonstrating the relative
impact of environmental uncertainty, and showing how the antecedents of
alignment vary between SMEs and large firms.",Amitha Padukkage; Val Hooper; Janet Toland,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00744v1,False,True,False,False,False,434.0,Patrick J Kehoe,Chicago,Completed,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1606.00744,"Business, Strategic alignment, Industrial organization, Key (lock), Small and medium-sized enterprises, Knowledge management, Marketing, Computer science, Strategic planning, Computer security, Strategic financial management, Finance",,,
Why not now? Intended timing in entrepreneurial intentions,"Purpose: Understanding the formation of entrepreneurial intentions is
critical, given that it is the first step in the entrepreneurial process.
Although entrepreneurial intention has been extensively studied, little
attention has been paid on the intended timing of future entrepreneurial
projects. This paper analyses entrepreneurial intentions among final-year
university students after graduation in terms of the timeframe to start a
business. Potentially rapid entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs-in-waiting were
compared using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Methodology: A
variance-based structural equation modelling approach was used for the sample
of 851 final-year university students with entrepreneurial intentions who
participated in GUESSS project. Findings: The results obtained contribute to
the understanding of how entrepreneurial intentions are formed, particularly,
how intended timing plays a moderating role in the relationships of the
variables of the theoretical model of TPB. This study provides empirical
evidence that significant differences exist between potential rapid
entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs-in-waiting. Practical implications: The
findings of this study have practical implications for entrepreneurship
education, and they can help policy makers develop more effective policies and
programs to promote entrepreneurship. Originality: Intention-based models have
traditionally examined the intent -- but not the timing -- of new venture
creation. However, the time elapsed between the formation of the
entrepreneurial intent and the identification of a business opportunity can
vary considerably. Therefore, analysing the moderating role of intended timing
could be relevant to entrepreneurial intention research.",Antonio Rafael Ramos-Rodriguez; Jose Aurelio Medina-Garrido; Jose Ruiz-Navarro,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13682v1,False,True,False,False,False,447.0,Austan Goolsbee,Chicago,Completed,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11365-019-00586-5,"Entrepreneurship, Theory of planned behavior, Originality, Variance (accounting), Marketing, Graduation (instrument), Sample (material), Entrepreneurial education, Psychology, Structural equation modeling, Process (computing), Entrepreneurship education, Business, Social psychology, Control (management), Economics, Management, Creativity, Accounting, Computer science, Chemistry, Geometry, Finance, Mathematics, Chromatography, Machine learning, Operating system",Universidad de Cádiz,"INDESS, Universidad de Cádiz, Campus de Jerez.

"Roles of Retailers in the Peer-to-Peer Electricity Market: A Single
  Retailer Perspective","Despite extensive research in the past five years and several successfully
completed and on-going pilot projects, regulators are still reluctant to
implement peer-to-peer trading at a large-scale in today's electricity market.
The reason could partly be attributed to the perceived disadvantage of current
market participants like retailers due to their exclusion from market
participation - a fundamental property of decentralised peer-to-peer trading.
As a consequence, recently, there has been growing pressure from energy service
providers in favour of retailers' participation in peer-to-peer trading.
However, the role of retailers in the peer-to-peer market is yet to be
established as no existing study has challenged this fundamental circumspection
of decentralized trading. In this context, this perspective takes the first
step to discuss the feasibility of retailers' involvement in the peer-to-peer
market. In doing so, we identify key characteristics of retail-based and
peer-to-peer electricity markets and discuss our viewpoint on how to
incorporate a single retailer in a peer-to-peer market without compromising the
fundamental decision-making characteristics of both markets. Finally, we give
an example of a hypothetical business model to demonstrate how a retailer can
be a part of a peer-to-peer market with a promise of collective benefits for
the participants.",Wayes Tushar; Chau Yuen; Tapan Saha; Deb Chattopadhyay; Sohrab Nizami; Sarmad Hanif; Jan E Alam; H.

"Monopoly Market with Externality: an Analysis with Statistical Physics
  and Agent Based Computational Economics","We explore the effects of social influence in a simple market model in which
a large number of agents face a binary choice: 'to buy/not to buy' a single
unit of a product at a price posted by a single seller (the monopoly case). We
consider the case of 'positive externalities': an agent is more willing to buy
if the other agents with whom he/she interacts make the same decision.
  We compare two special cases known in the economics literature as the
Thurstone and the McFadden approaches. We show that they correspond to modeling
the heterogenity in individual decision rules with, respectively, annealed and
quenched disorder. More precisely the first case leads to a standard Ising
model at finite temperature in a uniform external field, and the second case to
a random field Ising model (RFIM) at zero temperature.
  Considering the optimisation of profit by the seller within the McFadden/RFIM
model in the mean field limit, we exhibit a new first order phase transition:
if the social influence is strong enough, there is a regime where, if the mean
willingness to pay increases, or if the production costs decrease, the optimal
solution for the seller jumps from one with a high price and a small number of
buyers, to another one with a low price and a large number of buyers.",Jean-Pierre Nadal; Denis Phan; Mirta B.

This paper is devoted to defining urban and rural regions using ideas from

self-similar patterns associated with recursive processes. Then multifractal
geometry can be employed to describe or define the urban and rural terrain with
the level of urbanization. A space-filling index of urban-rural region based on
the generalized correlation dimension is presented to reflect the degree of
geo-spatial utilization in terms of urbanization. The census data of America

Snapshot Models of Undocumented Immigration,"The Mexican Migration Project (MMP) is a study that includes samples of
undocumented Mexican immigrants to the United States after their return to
Mexico. Of particular interest are the departure and return dates of a sampled
migrant's most recent sojourn in the United States, and the total number of
such journeys undertaken by that migrant household, for these data enable the
construction of data-driven undocumented immigration models. However, such data
are subject to an extreme physical bias, for to be included in such a sample, a
migrant must have returned to Mexico by the time of the survey, excluding those
undocumented immigrants still in the US. In our analysis, we account for this
bias by jointly modeling trip timing and duration to produce the likelihood of
observing the data in such a ""snapshot"" sample. Our analysis characterizes
undocumented migration flows including single visit migrants, repeat visitors,
and ""retirement"" from circular migration. Starting with 1987, we apply our
models to 30 annual random snapshot surveys of returned undocumented Mexican
migrants accounting for undocumented Mexican migration from 1980-2016. Contrary
to published estimates based on these same data, our results imply migrants
remain in the US much longer than previously estimated based on analysis that
ignored the physical snapshot bias. Scaling to population quantities, we
produce lower bounds on the total number of undocumented immigrants that are
much larger than conventional estimates based on US-based census-linked
surveys, and broadly consistent with the estimates reported by Fazel-Zarandi,
Feinstein and Kaplan (2018).",Scott Rodilitz; Edward H.

"Partner support during pregnancy mediates social inequalities in
  maternal postpartum depression for non-migrant and first generation migrant
  women","Background An advantaged socioeconomic position (SEP) and satisfying social
support during pregnancy (SSP) have been found to be protective factors of
maternal postpartum depression (PDD). An advantaged SEP is also associated with
satisfying SSP, making SSP a potential mediator of social inequalities in PPD.
SEP, SSP and PPD are associated with migrant status. The aim of this study was
to quantify the mediating role of SSP in social inequalities in PPD regarding
mother's migrant status. Methods A sub-sample of 15,000 mothers from the French
nationally-representative ELFE cohort study was used for the present analyses.
SEP was constructed as a latent variable measured with educational attainment,
occupational grade, employment, financial difficulties and household income.
SSP was characterized as perceived support from partner (good relation,
satisfying support and paternal leave) and actual support from midwives
(psychosocial risk factors assessment and antenatal education). Mediation
analyses with multiple mediators, stratified by migrant status were conducted.
Results Study population included 76% of non-migrant women, 12% of second and
12% of first generation migrant. SEP was positively associated with support
from partner, regardless of migrant status. Satisfying partner support was
associated with a 8 (non-migrant women) to 11% (first generation migrant women)
reduction in PPD score. Limitations History of depression was not
reported.Conclusions Partner support could reduce social inequalities in PPD.
This work supports the need of interventions, longitudinal and qualitative
studies including fathers and adapted to women at risk of PPD to better
understand the role of SSP in social inequalities in PPD. Keywords social

"Education Policy and Intergenerational Educational Persistence: Evidence
  from rural Benin","This paper employs a nonlinear difference-in-differences approach to
empirically examine the Maximally Maintained Inequality (MMI) hypothesis in
rural Benin. The findings of this study confirm the MMI hypothesis. In
particular, it is observed that when 76% of educated parents choose to educate
their daughters in the absence of educational programs, in contrast to only 37%
among non-educated parents, the average impact of tuition fee subsidy on
enrollment probability in primary schools stands at 3.8\% for non-educated
households and 0.27% for educated households. Conversely, in cases where only
27% of educated parents decide to educate their daughters without education
programs, the average effect of tuition fee waivers on enrollment probability
in primary schools increases to 19.64\% for non-educated households and 24\%
for educated households. From the analysis of household education decisions
influenced by a preference for education and budget constraints, three key
conclusions emerge to explain the mechanism behind the MMI. Firstly, when the
income advantage of educated households compared to non-educated households is
significantly high, irrespective of the level of their preference advantage,
reducing the financial cost of education induces a greater shift in education
decisions among non-educated households. Secondly, in situations where educated
households do not possess an income advantage relative to non-educated
households, the reduction in education-related financial costs leads to a more
pronounced change in education decisions among educated households. Lastly, for
the low-income advantage of educated households, as the income advantage of
educated households increases, non-educated households respond more to
education policy than educated parents, if the preference advantage of educated
households is relatively smaller.",Christelle Zozoungbo,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17391v1,False,True,False,False,False,487.0,Stacey H Chen,Boston,Completed,2011.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2401.17391,"Persistence (discontinuity), Political science, Economic growth, Geography, Development economics, Sociology, Economics, Geotechnical engineering, Engineering",,,
Will the last be the first? School closures and educational outcomes,"Governments have implemented school closures and online learning as one of
the main tools to reduce the spread of Covid-19. Despite the potential benefits
in terms of reduction of cases, the educational costs of these policies may be
dramatic. This work identifies the educational costs, expressed as decrease in
test scores, for the whole universe of Italian students attending the 5th, 8th
and 13th grade of the school cycle during the 2021/22 school year. The analysis
relies on a difference-in-difference model in relative time, where the control
group is the closest generation before the Covid-19 pandemic. The results
suggest a national average loss between 1.6-4.1% and 0.5-2.4% in Mathematics
and Italian test scores, respectively. After collecting the precise number of
days of school closures for the universe of students in Sicily, we estimate
that 30 additional days of closure decrease the test score by 1%. However, the
impact is much larger for students from high schools (1.8%) compared to
students from low and middle schools (0.5%). This is likely explained by the
lower relevance of parental inputs and higher reliance on peers inputs, within
the educational production function, for higher grades. Findings are also
heterogeneous across class size and parental job conditions, pointing towards
potential growing inequalities driven by the lack of in front teaching.",Michele Battisti; Giuseppe Maggio,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11606v1,False,True,False,False,False,487.0,Stacey H Chen,Boston,Completed,2011.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2023.104405,Economics,University of Palermo,"ICEA, Canada; Department of Economics, Business and Statistics, University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze 13, 90128 Palermo, Italy; Department of Law, University of Palermo, Piazza Bologni 8, 90134 Palermo, Italy","ICEA, Canada; Department of Economics, Business and Statistics, University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze 13, 90128 Palermo, Italy; Department of Law, University of Palermo, Piazza Bologni 8, 90134 Palermo, Italy"
"Stochastic modeling of particle structures in spray fluidized bed
  agglomeration using methods from machine learning","Agglomeration is an industrially relevant process for the production of bulk
materials in which the product properties depend on the morphology of the
agglomerates, e.g., on the distribution of size and shape descriptors. Thus,
accurate characterization and control of agglomerate morphologies is essential
to ensure high and consistent product quality. This paper presents a pipeline
for image-based inline agglomerate characterization and prediction of their
time-dependent multivariate morphology distributions within a spray fluidized
bed process with transparent glass beads as primary particles. The framework
classifies observed objects in image data into three distinct morphological
classes--primary particles, chain-like agglomerates and raspberry-like
agglomerates--using various size and shape descriptors. To this end, a fast and
robust random forest classifier is trained. Additionally, the fraction of
primary particles belonging to each of these classes, either as individual
primary particles or as part of a larger structure in the form of chain-like or
raspberry-like agglomerates, is described using parametric regression
functions. Finally, the temporal evolution of bivariate size and shape
descriptor distributions of these classes is modeled using low-parametric
regression functions and Archimedean copulas. This approach improves the
understanding of agglomerate formation and allows the prediction of process
kinetics, facilitating precise control over class fractions and morphology
distributions.",Lukas Fuchs; Sabrina Weber; Jialin Men; Niklas Eiermann; Orkun Furat; Andreas Bück; Volker Schmidt,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18882v1,False,True,False,False,False,490.0,Edward Feser,Triangle,Completed,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/jps.24594,"Pharmaceutical manufacturing, Computer science, Process (computing), Manufacturing engineering, Work in process, Risk analysis (engineering), Emerging technologies, Systems engineering, Management science, Data science, Engineering management, Engineering, Business, Operations management, Medicine, Artificial intelligence, Pharmacology, Operating system",Graz University of Technology; University of Copenhagen; Research Center Pharmaceutical Engineering (Austria),"Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Denmark; Institute of Process and Particle Engineering, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria; Research Center Pharmaceutical Engineering, Graz, Austria","Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Denmark; Institute of Process and Particle Engineering, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria; Research Center Pharmaceutical Engineering, Graz, Austria"
"Production externalities and dispersion process in a multi-region
  economy","We consider an economic geography model with two inter-regional proximity
structures: one governing goods trade and the other governing production
externalities across regions. We investigate how the introduction of the latter
affects the timing of endogenous agglomeration and the spatial distribution of
workers across regions. As transportation costs decline, the economy undergoes
a progressive dispersion process. Mono-centric agglomeration emerges when
inter-regional trade and/or production externalities incur high transportation
costs, while uniform dispersion occurs when these costs become negligibly small
(i.e., when distance dies). In multi-regional geography, the network structure
of production externalities can determine the geographical distribution of
workers as economic integration increases. If production externalities are
governed solely by geographical distance, a mono-centric spatial distribution
emerges in the form of suburbanization. However, if geographically distant
pairs of regions are connected through tight production linkages, multi-centric
spatial distribution can be sustainable.",Minoru Osawa; José M.

"Warehouse Problem with Bounds, Fixed Costs and Complementarity
  Constraints","This paper studies an open question in the warehouse problem where a merchant
trading a commodity tries to find an optimal inventory-trading policy to decide
on purchase and sale quantities during a fixed time horizon in order to
maximize their total pay-off, making use of fluctuations in sale and cost
prices. We provide the first known polynomial-time algorithms for the case when
there are fixed costs for purchases and sales, optional complementarity
constraints that prohibit purchasing and selling during the same time period,
and bounds on purchase and sales quantities. We do so by providing an exact
characterization of the extreme points of the feasible region and using this to
construct a suitable network where a min-cost flow computation provides an
optimal solution. We are also able to provide polynomial extended linear
formulations for the original feasible regions. Our methods build on the work
by Wolsey and Yaman (Discrete Optimization 2018). We also consider the problem
without fixed costs and provide a fully polynomial time approximation scheme in
a setting with time-dependent bounds.",Ishan Bansal; Oktay Günlük,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12136v1,False,True,False,False,False,491.0,Richard Chard,Washington,Completed,2007.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2302.12136,"Purchasing, Complementarity (molecular biology), Holding cost, Mathematical optimization, Fixed cost, Time horizon, Computation, Computer science, Time complexity, Order (exchange), Mathematics, Economics, Microeconomics, Operations management, Algorithm, Finance, Biology, Genetics",,,
Characteristics of Real Futures Trading Networks,"Futures trading is the core of futures business, and it is considered as one
of the typical complex systems. To investigate the complexity of futures
trading, we employ the analytical method of complex networks. First, we use
real trading records from the Shanghai Futures Exchange to construct futures
trading networks, in which nodes are trading participants, and two nodes have a
common edge if the two corresponding investors appear simultaneously in at
least one trading record as a purchaser and a seller respectively. Then, we
conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis on the constructed futures trading
networks. Empirical results show that the futures trading networks exhibit
features such as scale-free behavior with interesting odd-even-degree
divergence in low-degree regions, small-world effect, hierarchical
organization, power-law betweenness distribution, disassortative mixing, and
shrinkage of both the average path length and the diameter as network size
increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses real

"The perverse incentive for insurance instruments that are derivatives:
  solving the jackpot problem with a clawback lien for default insurance notes","When an insurance note is also a derivative a serious problem arises because
a derivative must be fulfilled immediately. This feature of derivatives
prevents claims processing procedures that screen out ineligible claims. This,
in turn, creates a perverse incentive for insured holders of notes to commit
acts that result in payment. This problem first surfaced with CDS contracts,
which are part of a class of loan insurance I term a default insurance note.
  Without an address to this problem, within the average range of returns for a
large venture capital portfolio, a venture-bank makes less money the better
their investments do, in a continuous function. The highest rate of return is a
total loss, 64% more than a top portfolio.
  Here, a strategy for removing this perverse incentive is defined, consisting
of a clawback lien that returns part of the payment value as a lien on the firm
that is the beneficiary of the insurance. This is presented as the final major
component for implementing a default insurance note system so that
venture-banking can operate to maximum benefit. Removing the perverse incentive
also minimizes disincentive for underwriters to deny DIN coverage to new
venture capital firms, or to those firms that have historical earnings which
are below average.",Brian P.

"Decarbonization patterns of residential building operations in China and
  India","As the two largest emerging emitters with the highest growth in operational
carbon from residential buildings, the historical emission patterns and
decarbonization efforts of China and India warrant further exploration. This
study aims to be the first to present a carbon intensity model considering
end-use performances, assessing the operational decarbonization progress of
residential building in India and China over the past two decades using the
improved decomposing structural decomposition approach. Results indicate (1)
the overall operational carbon intensity increased by 1.4% and 2.5% in China
and India, respectively, between 2000 and 2020. Household expenditure-related
energy intensity and emission factors were crucial in decarbonizing residential
buildings. (2) Building electrification played a significant role in
decarbonizing space cooling (-87.7 in China and -130.2 kilograms of carbon
dioxide (kgCO2) per household in India) and appliances (-169.7 in China and
-43.4 kgCO2 per household in India). (3) China and India collectively
decarbonized 1498.3 and 399.7 mega-tons of CO2 in residential building
operations, respectively. In terms of decarbonization intensity, India (164.8
kgCO2 per household) nearly caught up with China (182.5 kgCO2 per household) in
2020 and is expected to surpass China in the upcoming years, given the
country's robust annual growth rate of 7.3%. Overall, this study provides an
effective data-driven tool for investigating the building decarbonization
potential in China and India, and offers valuable insights for other emerging

"Applying Data Synthesis for Longitudinal Business Data across Three

protect. Many businesses have unique characteristics, and distributions of
employment, sales, and profits are highly skewed. Attackers wishing to conduct
identification attacks often have access to much more information than for any

strike an acceptable balance between usefulness and confidentiality protection.

The role of exceptional points in quantum systems,"In the present paper, first the mathematical basic properties of the
exceptional points are discussed. Then, their role in the description of real
physical quantum systems is considered. Most interesting value is the phase
rigidity of the eigenfunctions which varies between 1 (for distant
non-overlapping states) and 0 (at the exceptional point where the resonance
states completely overlap). This variation allows the system to incorporate
environmentally induced effects. In the very neighborhood of an exceptional
point, the system can be described well by a conventional nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation. In the regime of overlapping resonances, a dynamical
phase transition takes place to which all states of the system contribute: a
few short-lived resonance states are aligned to the scattering states of the
environment by trapping the other states. The trapped resonance states show
chaotic features. Due to the alignment of a few states with the states of the
environment, observable values may be enhanced. The dynamical phase transition
allows us to understand some experimental results which remained puzzling in
the framework of conventional Hermitian quantum physics. The effects caused by
the exceptional points in physical systems allow us to manipulate them for many
different applications.",Ingrid Rotter,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.0645v1,False,True,False,False,False,505.0,Ingrid G Ellen,Baruch,Completed,2011.0,,"Observable, Physical system, Physics, Statistical physics, Quantum, Eigenfunction, Nonlinear system, Quantum mechanics, Quantum system, Resonance (particle physics), Phase transition, Quantum chaos, Eigenvalues and eigenvectors, Classical mechanics, Quantum dynamics",,,
Implementation of Automata Theory to Improve the Learning Disability,"There are various types of disability egress in world like blindness,

"Distance Maps and Plant Development #1: Uniform Production and
  Proportional Destruction","Experimental data regarding auxin and venation formation exist at both
macroscopic and molecular scales, and we attempt to unify them into a
comprehensive model for venation formation. We begin with a set of principles
to guide an abstract model of venation formation, from which we show how
patterns in plant development are related to the representation of global
distance information locally as cellular-level signals. Venation formation, in
particular, is a function of distances between cells and their locations. The
first principle, that auxin is produced at a constant rate in all cells, leads
to a (Poisson) reaction-diffusion equation. Equilibrium solutions uniquely
codify information about distances, thereby providing cells with the signal to
begin differentiation from ground to vascular. A uniform destruction hypothesis
and scaling by cell size leads to a more biologically-relevant (Helmholtz)
model, and simulations demonstrate its capability to predict leaf and root
auxin distributions and venation patterns. The mathematical development is
centered on properties of the distance map, and provides a mechanism by which
global information about shape can be presented locally to individual cells.
The principles provide the foundation for an elaboration of these models in a
companion paper \cite{plos-paper2}, and together they provide a framework for
understanding organ- and plant-scale organization.",Pavel Dimitrov; Steven W.

"A housing-demographic multi-layered nonlinear model to test regulation
  strategies","We propose a novel multi-layered nonlinear model that is able to capture and
predict the housing-demographic dynamics of the real-state market by simulating
the transitions of owners among price-based house layers. This model allows us
to determine which parameters are most effective to smoothen the severity of a
potential market crisis. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has issued
severe warnings about the current real-state bubble in the United States, the
United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Australia and Spain in the last
years. Madrid (Spain), in particular, is an extreme case of this bubble. It is,
therefore, an excellent test case to analyze housing dynamics in the context of
the empirical data provided by the Spanish National Institute of Statistics and
other sources of data. The model is able to predict the mean house occupancy,
and shows that i) the house market conditions in Madrid are unstable but not
critical; and ii) the regulation of the construction rate is more effective
than interest rate changes. Our results indicate that to accommodate the
construction rate to the total population of first-time buyers is the most
effective way to maintain the system near equilibrium conditions. In addition,
we show that to raise interest rates will heavily affect the poorest housing
bands of the population while the middle class layers remain nearly unaffected.",Ramon Huerta; Fernando Corbacho; Luis F.

respect to housing and mobility choice that will constitute the first step in
the development of a dynamic incentive system for an open interactive

Quantifying the Invisible Labor in Crowd Work,"Crowdsourcing markets provide workers with a centralized place to find paid
work. What may not be obvious at first glance is that, in addition to the work
they do for pay, crowd workers also have to shoulder a variety of unpaid
invisible labor in these markets, which ultimately reduces workers' hourly
wages. Invisible labor includes finding good tasks, messaging requesters, or
managing payments. However, we currently know little about how much time crowd
workers actually spend on invisible labor or how much it costs them
economically. To ensure a fair and equitable future for crowd work, we need to
be certain that workers are being paid fairly for all of the work they do. In
this paper, we conduct a field study to quantify the invisible labor in crowd
work. We build a plugin to record the amount of time that 100 workers on Amazon
Mechanical Turk dedicate to invisible labor while completing 40,903 tasks. If
we ignore the time workers spent on invisible labor, workers' median hourly
wage was $3.76. But, we estimated that crowd workers in our study spent 33% of
their time daily on invisible labor, dropping their median hourly wage to
$2.83. We found that the invisible labor differentially impacts workers
depending on their skill level and workers' demographics. The invisible labor
category that took the most time and that was also the most common revolved
around workers having to manage their payments. The second most time-consuming
invisible labor category involved hyper-vigilance, where workers vigilantly
watched over requesters' profiles for newly posted work or vigilantly searched
for labor. We hope that through our paper, the invisible labor in crowdsourcing
becomes more visible, and our results help to reveal the larger implications of
the continuing invisibility of labor in crowdsourcing.",Carlos Toxtli; Siddharth Suri; Saiph Savage,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00169v1,False,True,False,False,False,539.0,David M Blau,Triangle,Completed,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.1145/3476060,"Crowdsourcing, Labour economics, Payment, Wage, Work (physics), Business, Demographics, Split labor market theory, Piece work, Economics, Labor relations, Secondary labor market, Computer science, Engineering, Sociology, Microeconomics, World Wide Web, Finance, Incentive, Mechanical engineering, Demography",Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México; Microsoft (United States); Bellevue Hospital Center; Universidad del Noreste; Northeastern University,"Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA; Northeastern University &amp; Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Ciudad Universitaria, Mexico; Microsoft Research, Bellevue, WA, USA","Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA; Northeastern University &amp; Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Ciudad Universitaria, Mexico; Microsoft Research, Bellevue, WA, USA"
Spatiotemporal characteristics of agricultural food import shocks,"Ensuring food supply stability is key to food security for economies, and
food imports become increasingly important to safeguard food supplies in
economies with inadequate food production. Food import shocks have significant
impacts on targeted economies. Using import trade data of four staple crops
(maize, rice, soybean, and wheat) from 1986 to 2018, this paper identifies food
import trade shocks that occurred to economies during the period of 1995--2018.
We compare the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of import shocks
occurring to different crops and analyze the shock intensity and shock recovery
in various continents based on locally weighted polynomial regression and
Cook's distance. The results reveal higher frequencies during the 2007/2008
food crisis and relatively higher shock frequencies in North America, Africa,
and Asia. Meanwhile, there are regional differences in shock recovery, with the
majority of shocks in Asia recovering in the short term. We also find that high
import diversity and a low import dependency ratio buffer economies against
import shocks, resulting in a low shock rate and a high recovery rate. These
results contribute to our understanding of the external supply risks of food,
placing emphasis on accessibility issues in food security.",Yin-Ting Zhang; Duc Khuong Nguyen; Wei-Xing Zhou,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00919v1,False,True,False,False,False,544.0,J Bradford Jensen,Boston,Completed,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2303.00919,"Food security, Shock (circulatory), Agriculture, Economics, Supply shock, Food processing, Distribution (mathematics), Food supply, Agricultural economics, International trade, International economics, Business, Geography, Monetary economics, Biology, Monetary policy, Medicine, Mathematical analysis, Food science, Mathematics, Archaeology, Internal medicine","IPAG Business School; Vietnam National University, Hanoi; East China University of Science and Technology","Research Center for Econophysics, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China; International School, Vietnam National University, Hanoi, Vietnam; School of Mathematics, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China; School of Business, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China; IPAG Business School, Paris, France","Research Center for Econophysics, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China; International School, Vietnam National University, Hanoi, Vietnam; School of Mathematics, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China; School of Business, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China; IPAG Business School, Paris, France"

Utilizing a Mathematical Model to Estimate Abortion Decline Scenario,"Abortion is one of the biggest causes of maternal deaths, accounting for 15%
of maternal deaths in Southeast Asia. The increase in and effectiveness of
using contraception are still considered to be the effective method to reduce
abortion rate. Data pertaining to abortion incidence and effective efforts to
reduce abortion rate in Indonesia is limited and difficult to access. Meanwhile
such supporting information is necessary to enable the planning and evaluation
of abortion control programs. This paper exemplifies the use of a mathematical
model to explain an abortion decline scenario. The model employs determinants
proposed by Bongaarts, which include average reproductive period, contraceptive
prevalence and effectiveness, total fertility rate (TFR), and intended total
fertility rate (ITFR), as well as birth and abortion intervals. The data used
is from the 1991-2007 Indonesian Demography and Health Survey (Survei Demografi
dan Kesehatan Indonesia/SDKI), and the unit of analysis is women who had been
married and aged 15-49 years old. Based on the current contraceptive prevalence
level in Indonesia at 59-61%, the estimated total abortion rate is 1.9-2.2.
Based on the plot of this total abortion rate, an abortion decline scenario can
be estimated. At the current TFR level of 2.6, the required contraceptive
prevalence is 69% (9% increase) for a decrease of one abortion case per woman.
With a delay of one year in the age of the first marriage and a birth interval
of three years, it is estimated that the abortion rate will decline from 3.05
to 0.69 case per woman throughout her reproductive period. Based on the
assumption of contraceptive prevalence growth at 1-1.4%, it can be estimated
that abortion rate will reach nearly 0 between 2018 and 2022.",R.

Fully Synthetic Data for Complex Surveys,"When seeking to release public use files for confidential data, statistical
agencies can generate fully synthetic data. We propose an approach for making
fully synthetic data from surveys collected with complex sampling designs. Our
approach adheres to the general strategy proposed by Rubin (1993).
Specifically, we generate pseudo-populations by applying the weighted finite
population Bayesian bootstrap to account for survey weights, take simple random
samples from those pseudo-populations, estimate synthesis models using these
simple random samples, and release simulated data drawn from the models as
public use files. To facilitate variance estimation, we use the framework of
multiple imputation with two data generation strategies. In the first, we
generate multiple data sets from each simple random sample. In the second, we
generate a single synthetic data set from each simple random sample. We present
multiple imputation combining rules for each setting. We illustrate the
repeated sampling properties of the combining rules via simulation studies,
including comparisons with synthetic data generation based on pseudo-likelihood
methods. We apply the proposed methods to a subset of data from the American
Community Survey.",Shirley Mathur; Yajuan Si; Jerome P.

"Dirichlet Process Mixture Models for Modeling and Generating Synthetic

multivariate categorical data when units are nested within groups. Such data
arise frequently in social science settings, for example, people living in
households. The model assumes that (i) each group is a member of a group-level
latent class, and (ii) each unit is a member of a unit-level latent class
nested within its group-level latent class. This structure allows the model to
capture dependence among units in the same group. It also facilitates
simultaneous modeling of variables at both group and unit levels. We develop a
version of the model that assigns zero probability to groups and units with
physically impossible combinations of variables. We apply the model to estimate
multivariate relationships in a subset of the American Community Survey. Using
the estimated model, we generate synthetic household data that could be

Data Fusion for Correcting Measurement Errors,"Often in surveys, key items are subject to measurement errors. Given just the
data, it can be difficult to determine the distribution of this error process,
and hence to obtain accurate inferences that involve the error-prone variables.
In some settings, however, analysts have access to a data source on different
individuals with high quality measurements of the error-prone survey items. We
present a data fusion framework for leveraging this information to improve
inferences in the error-prone survey. The basic idea is to posit models about
the rates at which individuals make errors, coupled with models for the values
reported when errors are made. This can avoid the unrealistic assumption of
conditional independence typically used in data fusion. We apply the approach
on the reported values of educational attainments in the American Community
Survey, using the National Survey of College Graduates as the high quality data
source. In doing so, we account for the informative sampling design used to
select the National Survey of College Graduates. We also present a process for
assessing the sensitivity of various analyses to different choices for the
measurement error models. Supplemental material is available online.",Tracy Schifeling; Jerome P.

"Discrimination and AI in insurance: what do people find fair? Results
  from a survey","Two modern trends in insurance are data-intensive underwriting and
behavior-based insurance. Data-intensive underwriting means that insurers use
and analyze more data for estimating the chance that a consumer files a claim
and calculating the premium based on that estimation. Insurers analyze the new
datasets with artificial intelligence (AI) to discover new correlations, with
which they can estimate the policyholder's expected claims cost more precisely.
Insurers also offer behavior-based insurance. For example, some car insurers
use AI to follow the driving behavior of an individual policyholder in
real-time and decide whether to offer that policyholder a discount. Similarly,
a life insurer could track a policyholder's activity with a smart watch and
offer a discount for an active lifestyle.
  In this paper, we report on a survey of the Dutch population (N=999) in which
we asked people's opinions about examples of data-intensive underwriting and
behavior-based insurance. The main results include the following. First, if
survey respondents find an insurance practice unfair, they also find the
practice unacceptable. Second, respondents find almost all modern insurance
practices that we described unfair. Third, respondents find practices fairer if
they can influence the premium. For example, respondents find behavior-based
car insurance with a car tracker relatively fair. Fourth, if respondents do not
see the logic of using a certain consumer characteristic, then respondents find
it unfair if an insurer calculates the premium based on the characteristic.
Fifth, respondents find it unfair if an insurer offers an insurance product
only to a specific group, such as car insurance specifically for family
doctors. Sixth, respondents find it unfair if an insurance practice leads to
higher prices for poorer people. We reflect on the policy implications of the
findings.",Frederik Zuiderveen Borgesius; Marvin van Bekkum; Iris van Ooijen; Gabi Schaap; Maaike Harbers; Tjerk Timan,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12897v1,False,True,False,False,False,565.0,Philip F Cooper,Washington,Completed,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2501.12897,"Actuarial science, Business",,,
Strategic Innovation Through Outsourcing: A Theoretical Review,"Competition in the Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO) and Business
Process Outsourcing (BPO) industry is increasingly moving from being motivated
by cost savings towards strategic benefits that service providers can offer to
their clients. Innovation is one such benefit that is expected nowadays in
outsourcing engagements. The rising importance of innovation has been noticed
and acknowledged not only in the Information Systems (IS) literature, but also
in other management streams such as innovation and strategy. However, to date,
these individual strands of research remain largely isolated from each other.
Our theoretical review addresses this gap by consolidating and analyzing
research on strategic innovation in the ITO and BPO context. The article set
includes 95 papers published between 1998 to 2020 in outlets from the IS and
related management fields. We craft a four-phase framework that integrates
prior insights about (1) the antecedents of the decision to pursue strategic
innovation in outsourcing settings; (2) arrangement options that facilitate
strategic innovation in outsourcing relationships; (3) the generation of
strategic innovations; and (4) realized strategic innovation outcomes, as
assessed in the literature. We find that the research landscape to date is
skewed, with many studies focusing on the first two phases. The last two phases
remain relatively uncharted. We also discuss how innovation-oriented
outsourcing insights compare with established research on cost-oriented
outsourcing engagements.

Evaluating the Impacts of Swapping on the US Decennial Census,"To meet its dual burdens of providing useful statistics and ensuring privacy
of individual respondents, the US Census Bureau has for decades introduced some
form of ""noise"" into published statistics. Initially, they used a method known
as ""swapping"" (1990-2010). In 2020, they switched to an algorithm called
TopDown that ensures a form of Differential Privacy. While the TopDown
algorithm has been made public, no implementation of swapping has been released
and many details of the deployed swapping methodology deployed have been kept
secret. Further, the Bureau has not published (even a synthetic) ""original""
dataset and its swapped version. It is therefore difficult to evaluate the
effects of swapping, and to compare these effects to those of other privacy
technologies. To address these difficulties we describe and implement a
parameterized swapping algorithm based on Census publications, court documents,
and informal interviews with Census employees. With this implementation, we
characterize the impacts of swapping on a range of statistical quantities of
interest. We provide intuition for the types of shifts induced by swapping and
compare against those introduced by TopDown. We find that even when swapping
and TopDown introduce errors of similar magnitude, the direction in which
statistics are biased need not be the same across the two techniques. More
broadly, our implementation provides researchers with the tools to analyze and
potentially correct for the impacts of disclosure avoidance systems on the
quantities they study.",Maria Ballesteros; Cynthia Dwork; Gary King; Conlan Olson; Manish Raghavan,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01320v2,True,True,True,False,True,567.0,Felicia B Leclere,Michigan,Completed,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.1145/3709025.3712210,"Census, Computer science, Data science, Environmental health, Population, Medicine",Harvard University Press; IIT@MIT; Columbia University,"MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA; Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA; Columbia University, New York, NY, USA","MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA; Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA; Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"
"Quantifying Privacy Risks of Public Statistics to Residents of
  Subsidized Housing","As the U.S. Census Bureau implements its controversial new disclosure
avoidance system, researchers and policymakers debate the necessity of new
privacy protections for public statistics. With experiments on both published
statistics and synthetic data, we explore a particular privacy concern:
respondents in subsidized housing may deliberately not mention unauthorized
children and other household members for fear of being evicted. By combining
public statistics from the Decennial Census and the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, we demonstrate a simple, inexpensive reconstruction attack
that could identify subsidized households living in violation of occupancy
guidelines in 2010. Experiments on synthetic data suggest that a random
swapping mechanism similar to the Census Bureau's 2010 disclosure avoidance
measures does not significantly reduce the precision of this attack, while a
differentially private mechanism similar to the 2020 disclosure avoidance
system does. Our results provide a valuable example for policymakers seeking a
trustworthy, accurate census.",Ryan Steed; Diana Qing; Zhiwei Steven Wu,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04776v1,True,True,True,False,True,567.0,Felicia B Leclere,Michigan,Completed,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2407.04776,"Subsidy, Business, Internet privacy, Actuarial science, Public economics, Economics, Computer science, Market economy",,,
"Confidence-Ranked Reconstruction of Census Microdata from Published
  Statistics","A reconstruction attack on a private dataset $D$ takes as input some publicly
accessible information about the dataset and produces a list of candidate
elements of $D$. We introduce a new class of data reconstruction attacks based
on randomized methods for non-convex optimization. We empirically demonstrate
that our attacks can not only reconstruct full rows of $D$ from aggregate query
statistics $Q(D)\in \mathbb{R}^m$, but can do so in a way that reliably ranks
reconstructed rows by their odds of appearing in the private data, providing a
signature that could be used for prioritizing reconstructed rows for further
actions such as identify theft or hate crime. We also design a sequence of
baselines for evaluating reconstruction attacks. Our attacks significantly
outperform those that are based only on access to a public distribution or
population from which the private dataset $D$ was sampled, demonstrating that
they are exploiting information in the aggregate statistics $Q(D)$, and not
simply the overall structure of the distribution. In other words, the queries
$Q(D)$ are permitting reconstruction of elements of this dataset, not the
distribution from which $D$ was drawn. These findings are established both on
2010 U.S. decennial Census data and queries and Census-derived American
Community Survey datasets. Taken together, our methods and experiments

"Tax Credits and Household Behavior: The Roles of Myopic Decision-Making
  and Liquidity in a Simulated Economy","There has been a growing interest in multi-agent simulators in the domain of
economic modeling. However, contemporary research often involves developing
reinforcement learning (RL) based models that focus solely on a single type of
agents, such as households, firms, or the government. Such an approach
overlooks the adaptation of interacting agents thereby failing to capture the
complexity of real-world economic systems. In this work, we consider a
multi-agent simulator comprised of RL agents of numerous types, including
heterogeneous households, firm, central bank and government. In particular, we
focus on the crucial role of the government in distributing tax credits to
households. We conduct two broad categories of comprehensive experiments
dealing with the impact of tax credits on 1) households with varied degrees of
myopia (short-sightedness in spending and saving decisions), and 2) households
with diverse liquidity profiles. The first category of experiments examines the
impact of the frequency of tax credits (e.g. annual vs quarterly) on
consumption patterns of myopic households. The second category of experiments
focuses on the impact of varying tax credit distribution strategies on
households with differing liquidities. We validate our simulation model by
reproducing trends observed in real households upon receipt of unforeseen,
uniform tax credits, as documented in a JPMorgan Chase report. Based on the
results of the latter, we propose an innovative tax credit distribution
strategy for the government to reduce inequality among households. We
demonstrate the efficacy of this strategy in improving social welfare in our
simulation results.",Kshama Dwarakanath; Jialin Dong; Svitlana Vyetrenko,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10391v2,False,True,False,False,False,575.0,Alicia Robb,Berkeley,Completed,2007.0,https://doi.org/10.1145/3677052.3698599,"Market liquidity, Tax credit, Economics, Monetary economics, Business, Microeconomics, Public economics","University of California, Los Angeles; JPMorgan Chase & Co (United States)","AI Research, JP Morgan Chase, USA; University of California, Los Angeles, USA; AI Research, J.

"Precision Health Data: Requirements, Challenges and Existing Techniques
  for Data Security and Privacy","Precision health leverages information from various sources, including omics,
lifestyle, environment, social media, medical records, and medical insurance
claims to enable personalized care, prevent and predict illness, and precise
treatments. It extensively uses sensing technologies (e.g., electronic health
monitoring devices), computations (e.g., machine learning), and communication
(e.g., interaction between the health data centers). As health data contain
sensitive private information, including the identity of patient and carer and
medical conditions of the patient, proper care is required at all times.
Leakage of these private information affects the personal life, including
bullying, high insurance premium, and loss of job due to the medical history.
Thus, the security, privacy of and trust on the information are of utmost
importance. Moreover, government legislation and ethics committees demand the
security and privacy of healthcare data. Herein, in the light of precision
health data security, privacy, ethical and regulatory requirements, finding the
best methods and techniques for the utilization of the health data, and thus
precision health is essential. In this regard, firstly, this paper explores the
regulations, ethical guidelines around the world, and domain-specific needs.
Then it presents the requirements and investigates the associated challenges.
Secondly, this paper investigates secure and privacy-preserving machine
learning methods suitable for the computation of precision health data along
with their usage in relevant health projects. Finally, it illustrates the best
available techniques for precision health data security and privacy with a
conceptual system model that enables compliance, ethics clearance, consent

"Mobility Gaps between Low-Income and Not Low-Income Households: A Case
  Study in New York State","Understanding the travel challenges faced by low-income residents has always
been and continues to be one of the most important transportation equity
topics. This study aims to explore the mobility gaps between low-income
households (HHs) and not low-income HHs, and how the gaps vary within different
socio-demographic population groups in New York State (NYS). The latest
National Household Travel Survey data was used as the primary data source for
the analysis. The study first employed the K-prototype clustering algorithm to
categorize the HHs in NYS based on their socio-demographic attributes. Five
population groups were identified based on nine different household (HH)
features such as HH size, vehicle ownership, and elderly status of its members.
Then, the mobility differences, measured by trip frequency, trip distance,
travel time, and person miles traveled, were examined among the five population
groups. Results suggest that the individuals in low-income HHs consistently
took fewer trips and made shorter trips compared to their not low-income
counterparts in NYS. The travel distance gaps were most obvious among white HHs
with more vehicles than drivers. In addition, while the population from
low-income HHs made shorter trips on average (2.7 mi shorter per trip), they
experienced longer travel time than those from not low-income HHs (1.8 min
longer per trip). These key findings provide a deeper understanding of the
travel behavior disparities between low-income and not low-income households.
The findings could also support policymakers and transportation planners in
addressing the critical needs of residents in low-income households in NYS and
provide inputs for designing a more equitable transportation system.",Yuandong Liu; Majbah Uddin,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04018v1,False,True,False,False,False,582.0,Michael H Riordan,Baruch,Completed,2011.0,https://doi.org/10.1061/9780784484883.057,"TRIPS architecture, Equity (law), Population, Household income, Demographic economics, Travel behavior, Business, Low income, Travel survey, Socioeconomic status, Personal income, Geography, Socioeconomics, Economics, Economic growth, Transport engineering, Medicine, Environmental health, Political science, Engineering, Law, Archaeology",Oak Ridge National Laboratory; National Transportation Research Center,"National Transportation Research Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN.","National Transportation Research Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN."
"Machine learning to assess relatedness: the advantage of using
  firm-level data","The relatedness between a country or a firm and a product is a measure of the
feasibility of that economic activity. As such, it is a driver for investments
at a private and institutional level. Traditionally, relatedness is measured
using networks derived by country-level co-occurrences of product pairs, that
is counting how many countries export both. In this work, we compare networks
and machine learning algorithms trained not only on country-level data, but
also on firms, that is something not much studied due to the low availability
of firm-level data. We quantitatively compare the different measures of
relatedness, by using them to forecast the exports at the country and
firm-level, assuming that more related products have a higher likelihood to be
exported in the future. Our results show that relatedness is scale-dependent:
the best assessments are obtained by using machine learning on the same
typology of data one wants to predict. Moreover, we found that while
relatedness measures based on country data are not suitable for firms,
firm-level data are very informative also for the development of countries. In
this sense, models built on firm data provide a better assessment of
relatedness. We also discuss the effect of using parameter optimization and
community detection algorithms to identify clusters of related companies and
products, finding that a partition into a higher number of blocks decreases the
computational time while maintaining a prediction performance well above the
network-based benchmarks.",Giambattista Albora; Andrea Zaccaria,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00458v3,False,True,False,False,False,585.0,Chang-Tai Hsieh,Chicago,Completed,2009.0,https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/2095048,"Computer science, Artificial intelligence, Machine learning",Enrico Fermi Center for Study and Research; Institute for Complex Systems; Sapienza University of Rome,"Enrico Fermi Center for Study and Research, Rome; Institute for Complex Systems-CNR, UOS Sapienza, Rome; Sapienza University, Department of Physics, Rome","Enrico Fermi Center for Study and Research, Rome; Institute for Complex Systems-CNR, UOS Sapienza, Rome; Sapienza University, Department of Physics, Rome"
"Structure of global buyer-supplier networks and its implications for
  conflict minerals regulations","We investigate the structure of global inter-firm linkages using a dataset
that contains information on business partners for about 400,000 firms
worldwide, including all the firms listed on the major stock exchanges. Among
the firms, we examine three networks, which are based on customer-supplier,
licensee-licensor, and strategic alliance relationships. First, we show that
these networks all have scale-free topology and that the degree distribution
for each follows a power law with an exponent of 1.5. The shortest path length
is around six for all three networks. Second, we show through community
structure analysis that the firms comprise a community with those firms that
belong to the same industry but different home countries, indicating the
globalization of firms' production activities. Finally, we discuss what such
production globalization implies for the proliferation of conflict minerals
(i.e., minerals extracted from conflict zones and sold to firms in other
countries to perpetuate fighting) through global buyer-supplier linkages. We
show that a limited number of firms belonging to some specific industries and
countries plays an important role in the global proliferation of conflict
minerals. Our numerical simulation shows that regulations on the purchases of
conflict minerals by those firms would substantially reduce their worldwide
use.",Takayuki Mizuno; Takaaki Ohnishi; Tsutomu Watanabe,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02274v1,False,True,False,False,False,585.0,Chang-Tai Hsieh,Chicago,Completed,2009.0,https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0063-7,"Business, Globalization, Industrial organization, Production (economics), Strategic alliance, Licensee, Alliance, Economic geography, Economics, Market economy, Microeconomics, Computer science, License, Political science, Law, Operating system",National Institute of Informatics; Canon (Japan),"National Institute of Informatics, Hitotsubashi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 101-8430, Japan; The Canon Institute for Global Studies, Marunouchi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 100-6511, Japan","National Institute of Informatics, Hitotsubashi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 101-8430, Japan; The Canon Institute for Global Studies, Marunouchi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 100-6511, Japan"
The Similarity of Global Value Chains: A Network-Based Measure,"International trade has been increasingly organized in the form of global
value chains (GVCs) where different stages of production are located in
different countries. This recent phenomenon has substantial consequences for
both trade policy design at the national or regional level and business
decision making at the firm level. In this paper, we provide a new method for
comparing GVCs across countries and over time. First, we use the World
Input-Output Database (WIOD) to construct both the upstream and downstream
global value networks, where the nodes are individual sectors in different
countries and the links are the value-added contribution relationships. Second,
we introduce a network-based measure of node similarity to compare the GVCs
between any pair of countries for each sector and each year available in the
WIOD. Our network-based similarity is a better measure for node comparison than
the existing ones because it takes into account all the direct and indirect
relationships between country-sector pairs, is applicable to both directed and
weighted networks with self-loops, and takes into account externally defined
node attributes. As a result, our measure of similarity reveals the most
intensive interactions among the GVCs across countries and over time. From 1995
to 2011, the average similarity between sectors and countries have clear
increasing trends, which are temporarily interrupted by the recent economic
crisis. This measure of the similarity of GVCs provides quantitative answers to
important questions about dependency, sustainability, risk, and competition in
the global production system.",Zhen Zhu; Greg Morrison; Michelangelo Puliga; Alessandro Chessa; Massimo Riccaboni,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04392v1,False,True,False,False,False,585.0,Chang-Tai Hsieh,Chicago,Completed,2009.0,https://doi.org/10.1017/nws.2018.8,"Similarity (geometry), Value (mathematics), Production (economics), Node (physics), Construct (python library), Measure (data warehouse), Business, Competition (biology), Economics, Industrial organization, Computer science, Microeconomics, Data mining, Artificial intelligence, Ecology, Engineering, Programming language, Structural engineering, Machine learning, Image (mathematics), Biology",University of Greenwich; University of Houston; KU Leuven; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca,"IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, Italy and Linkalab, Cagliari, Italy (e-mail:; Department of International Business and Economics, University of Greenwich, SE10 9LS London, UK (e-mail:; Department of Physics, University of Houston, Houston TX 77204, USA (e-mail:; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, 55100 Lucca, Italy; Department of Managerial Economics, Strategy and Innovation, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium (e-mail:","IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, Italy and Linkalab, Cagliari, Italy (e-mail:; Department of International Business and Economics, University of Greenwich, SE10 9LS London, UK (e-mail:; Department of Physics, University of Houston, Houston TX 77204, USA (e-mail:; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, 55100 Lucca, Italy; Department of Managerial Economics, Strategy and Innovation, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium (e-mail:"
"High-resolution estimates of the foreign-born population and

understanding population dynamics, and the impact of economic and political
changes that influence migration. Using data from the 2000 decennial census and
2001-2016 American Community Survey (ACS), this study derives
highly-disaggregated estimates of the foreign-born population residing in the
United States for the period 2000-2018, and annual foreign-born entries to the
ACS population as a measure of immigration volume. These estimates are derived
from an evidence synthesis combining pooled survey data with auxiliary data on
potential biases in raw survey estimates and other trends affecting the
foreign-born population. For an individual population stratum (defined by
current age, entry year, country of origin, and calendar year) direct estimates
using survey data can have substantial sampling uncertainty. By imposing
logical and probabilistic constraints, data are pooled across survey years to
produce more precise estimates. Corrections are implemented for respondent
misreporting of demographic information, and undercount of the foreign-born

"Sources of HIV infections among MSM with a migration background: a viral
  phylogenetic case study in Amsterdam, the Netherlands","Background: Men and women with a migration background comprise an increasing
proportion of incident HIV cases across Western Europe. Several studies
indicate a substantial proportion acquire HIV post-migration.
  Methods: We used partial HIV consensus sequences with linked demographic and
clinical data from the opt-out ATHENA cohort of people with HIV in the
Netherlands to quantify population-level sources of transmission to Dutch-born
and foreign-born Amsterdam men who have sex with men (MSM) between 2010-2021.
We identified phylogenetically and epidemiologically possible transmission
pairs in local transmission chains and interpreted these in the context of
estimated infection dates, quantifying transmission dynamics between
sub-populations by world region of birth.
  Results: We estimate the majority of Amsterdam MSM who acquired their
infection locally had a Dutch-born Amsterdam MSM source (56% [53-58%]).
Dutch-born MSM were the predominant source population of infections among
almost all foreign-born Amsterdam MSM sub-populations. Stratifying by two-year
intervals indicated shifts in transmission dynamics, with a majority of
infections originating from foreign-born MSM since 2018, although uncertainty
ranges remained wide.
  Conclusions: In the context of declining HIV incidence among Amsterdam MSM,
our data suggest whilst native-born MSM have predominantly driven transmissions
in 2010-2021, the contribution from foreign-born MSM living in Amsterdam is
increasing.",Alexandra Blenkinsop; Nikos Pantazis; Evangelia Georgia Kostaki; Lysandros Sofocleous; Ard van Sighem; Daniela Bezemer; Thijs van de Laar; Marc van der Valk; Peter Reiss; Godelieve de Bree; Oliver Ratmann,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08308v1,False,True,False,False,False,586.0,Mary M Kritz,Cornell,Completed,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2401.08308,"Demography, Transmission (telecommunications), Context (archaeology), Men who have sex with men, Population, Incidence (geometry), Foreign born, Cohort, Geography, Medicine, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Virology, Sociology, Engineering, Syphilis, Optics, Internal medicine, Electrical engineering, Physics, Archaeology",,on behalf of the HIV Transmission Elimination AMsterdam Initiative,on behalf of the HIV Transmission Elimination AMsterdam Initiative

"Effect of Precursors and Radiation on Soot Formation in Turbulent
  Diffusion Flame","Soot formation in Delft flame III, a pilot stabilized turbulent diffusion
flame burning natural gas/air, is investigated using ANSYS FLUENT by
considering two different approaches for soot inception. In the first approach
soot inception is based on the formation rate of acetylene, while the second
approach considers the formation rate of two and three-ringed aromatics to
describe the soot inception [1]. Transport equations are solved for soot mass
fraction and radical nuclei concentration to describe inception, coagulation,
surface growth, and oxidation processes. The turbulent-chemistry interactions
and soot precursors are described by the steady laminar flamelet model (SLFM).
Two chemical mechanisms GRI 3.0 [2] and POLIMI [3] are used to represent the
effect of species concentration on soot formation. The radiative properties of
the medium are included based on the non-gray modeling approach by considering
four factious gases; the weighted sum of gray gas (WSGGM) approach is used to
model the absorption coefficient. The effect of soot on radiative transfer is
modeled in terms of effective absorption coefficient of the medium. A beta
probability density function (\b{eta}-PDF) in terms of normalized temperature
is used to describe the effect of turbulence on soot formation. The results
clearly elucidate the strong effect of radiation and species concentration on
soot volume fraction predictions. Due to increase in radiative heat loss with
soot, flame temperature decreases slightly. The inclusion of ethylene has less
synergic effect than that of both benzene and ethylene. Both cases have less
impact on the nucleation of soot. The increase in soot volume fraction with
soot-turbulence interaction is in consistence with the DNS predictions.",Manedhar Reddy B; Ashoke De; Rakesh Yadav,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11060v1,False,True,False,False,False,588.0,Siim Soot,Chicago,Completed,2009.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2015.01.080,"Soot, Turbulent diffusion, Chemistry, Diffusion flame, Thermodynamics, Diffusion, Turbulence, Combustion, Physical chemistry, Physics, Combustor",Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur,"Ansys Fluent India Pvt.

"Soot particle size distribution reconstruction in a turbulent sooting
  flame with the split-based extended quadrature method of moments","The Method of Moments (MOM) has largely been applied to investigate sooting
laminar and turbulent flames. However, the classical MOM is not able to
characterize a continuous particle size distribution (PSD). Without access to
information on the PSD, it is difficult to accurately take into account
particle oxidation, which is crucial for shrinking and eliminating soot
particles. Recently, the Split-based Extended Quadrature Method of Moments
(S-EQMOM) has been proposed as a numerically robust alternative to overcome
this issue (Salenbauch et al., 2019). The main advantage is that a continuous
particle number density function can be reconstructed by superimposing kernel
density functions (KDF). Moreover, the S-EQMOM primary nodes are determined
individually for each KDF, improving the moment realizability.
  In this work, the S-EQMOM is combined with a Large Eddy
Simulation/presumed-PDF flamelet/progress variable approach for predicting soot
formation in the Delft Adelaide Flame III. The target flame features low/high
sooting propensity/intermittency and comprehensive flow/scalar/soot data are
available for model validation. Simulation results are compared with the
experimental data for both the gas phase and the particulate phase. A good
quantitative agreement has been obtained especially in terms of the soot volume
fraction. The reconstructed PSD reveals predominantly unimodal/bimodal
distributions in the first/downstream portion of this flame, with particle
diameters smaller than 100 nm. By investigating the instantaneous and
statistical sooting behavior at the flame tip, it has been found that the
experimentally observed soot intermittency is linked to mixture fraction
fluctuations around its stoichiometric value that exhibit a bimodal probability
density function.",Federica Ferraro; Sandro Gierth; Steffen Salenbauch; Wang Han; Christian Hasse,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02219v2,False,True,False,False,False,588.0,Siim Soot,Chicago,Completed,2009.0,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0098382,"Physics, Intermittency, Laminar flow, Soot, Turbulence, Mechanics, Distribution function, Particle-laden flows, Probability density function, Statistical physics, Reynolds number, Thermodynamics, Statistics, Combustion, Chemistry, Mathematics, Organic chemistry",Technical University of Darmstadt; University of Edinburgh,"School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh 2 , Edinburgh EH8 3JL, Scotland, United Kingdom; Technical University of Darmstadt, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Simulation of Reactive Thermo-Fluid Systems 1 , Otto-Berndt-Straße 2, Darmstadt 64287, Germany","School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh 2 , Edinburgh EH8 3JL, Scotland, United Kingdom; Technical University of Darmstadt, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Simulation of Reactive Thermo-Fluid Systems 1 , Otto-Berndt-Straße 2, Darmstadt 64287, Germany"
Nursing Home Staff Networks and COVID-19,"Nursing homes and other long term-care facilities account for a
disproportionate share of COVID-19 cases and fatalities worldwide. Outbreaks in
U.S. nursing homes have persisted despite nationwide visitor restrictions
beginning in mid-March. An early report issued by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention identified staff members working in multiple nursing
homes as a likely source of spread from the Life Care Center in Kirkland,
Washington to other skilled nursing facilities. The full extent of staff
connections between nursing homes---and the crucial role these connections
serve in spreading a highly contagious respiratory infection---is currently
unknown given the lack of centralized data on cross-facility nursing home
employment. In this paper, we perform the first large-scale analysis of nursing
home connections via shared staff using device-level geolocation data from 30
million smartphones, and find that 7 percent of smartphones appearing in a
nursing home also appeared in at least one other facility---even after visitor
restrictions were imposed. We construct network measures of nursing home
connectedness and estimate that nursing homes have, on average, connections
with 15 other facilities. Controlling for demographic and other factors, a
home's staff-network connections and its centrality within the greater network
strongly predict COVID-19 cases. Traditional federal regulatory metrics of
nursing home quality are unimportant in predicting outbreaks, consistent with
recent research. Results suggest that eliminating staff linkages between
nursing homes could reduce COVID-19 infections in nursing homes by 44 percent.",M. Keith Chen; Judith A. Chevalier; Elisa F.

"A Latent Survival Analysis Enabled Simulation Platform For Nursing Home
  Staffing Strategy Evaluation","Nursing homes are critical facilities for caring frail older adults with
round-the-clock formal care and personal assistance. To ensure quality care for
nursing home residents, adequate staffing level is of great importance. Current
nursing home staffing practice is mainly based on experience and regulation.
The objective of this paper is to investigate the viability of experience-based
and regulation-based strategies, as well as alternative staffing strategies to
minimize labor costs subject to heterogeneous service demand of nursing home
residents under various scenarios of census. We propose a data-driven analysis
framework to model heterogeneous service demand of nursing home residents and
further identify appropriate staffing strategies by combing survival model and
computer simulation techniques as well as domain knowledge. Specifically, in
the analysis, we develop an agent-based simulation tool consisting of four main
modules, namely individual length of stay predictor, individual daily staff
time generator, facility level staffing strategy evaluator, and graphical user
interface. We use real nursing home data to validate the proposed model, and
demonstrate that the identified staffing strategy significantly reduces the
total labor cost of certified nursing assistants compared to the benchmark
strategies. Additionally, the proposed length of stay predictive model that
considers multiple discharge dispositions exhibits superior accuracy and offers
better staffing decisions than those without the consideration. Further, we
construct different census scenarios of nursing home residents to demonstrate

"Are deep learning models superior for missing data imputation in large
  surveys? Evidence from an empirical comparison","Multiple imputation (MI) is a popular approach for dealing with missing data
arising from non-response in sample surveys. Multiple imputation by chained
equations (MICE) is one of the most widely used MI algorithms for multivariate
data, but it lacks theoretical foundation and is computationally intensive.
Recently, missing data imputation methods based on deep learning models have
been developed with encouraging results in small studies. However, there has
been limited research on evaluating their performance in realistic settings
compared to MICE, particularly in big surveys. We conduct extensive simulation
studies based on a subsample of the American Community Survey to compare the
repeated sampling properties of four machine learning based MI methods: MICE
with classification trees, MICE with random forests, generative adversarial
imputation networks, and multiple imputation using denoising autoencoders. We
find the deep learning imputation methods are superior to MICE in terms of
computational time. However, with the default choice of hyperparameters in the
common software packages, MICE with classification trees consistently
outperforms, often by a large margin, the deep learning imputation methods in
terms of bias, mean squared error, and coverage under a range of realistic
settings.",Zhenhua Wang; Olanrewaju Akande; Jason Poulos; Fan Li,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09316v3,False,False,False,False,True,592.0,Adriana Perez,Washington,Completed,2009.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2103.09316,"Imputation (statistics), Missing data, Computer science, Hyperparameter, Artificial intelligence, Random forest, Deep learning, Machine learning, Multivariate statistics, Generative grammar, Data mining, Statistics, Mathematics",,,
"An Empirical Comparison of Multiple Imputation Methods for Categorical
  Data","Multiple imputation is a common approach for dealing with missing values in
statistical databases. The imputer fills in missing values with draws from
predictive models estimated from the observed data, resulting in multiple,
completed versions of the database. Researchers have developed a variety of
default routines to implement multiple imputation; however, there has been
limited research comparing the performance of these methods, particularly for
categorical data. We use simulation studies to compare repeated sampling
properties of three default multiple imputation methods for categorical data,
including chained equations using generalized linear models, chained equations
using classification and regression trees, and a fully Bayesian joint
distribution based on Dirichlet Process mixture models. We base the simulations
on categorical data from the American Community Survey. In the circumstances of
this study, the results suggest that default chained equations approaches based
on generalized linear models are dominated by the default regression tree and
Bayesian mixture model approaches. They also suggest competing advantages for
the regression tree and Bayesian mixture model approaches, making both
reasonable default engines for multiple imputation of categorical data. A

"Viability of Mobile Forms for Population Health Surveys in Low Resource
  Areas","Population health surveys are an important tool to effectively allocate
limited resources in low resource communities. In such an environment, surveys
are often done by local population with pen and paper. Data thus collected is
difficult to tabulate and analyze. We conducted a series of interviews and
experiments in the Philippines to assess if mobile forms can be a viable and
more efficient survey method. We first conducted pilot interviews and found 60%
of the local surveyors actually preferred mobile forms over paper. We then
built a software that can generate mobile forms that are easy to use, capable
of working offline, and able to track key metrics such as time to complete
questions. Our mobile form was field tested in three locations in the
Philippines with 33 surveyors collecting health survey responses from 266
subjects. The percentage of surveyors preferring mobile forms increased to 76%
after just using the form a few times. The results demonstrate our mobile form
is a viable method to conduct large scale population health surveys in a low
resource environment.",Alexander Davis; Aidan Chen; Milton Chen; James Davis,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07888v1,False,True,False,False,False,595.0,Lucas W Davis,Michigan,Completed,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1109/ghtc56179.2023.10354577,"Resource (disambiguation), Computer science, Population, Key (lock), Mobile device, Scale (ratio), Geography, Data science, Computer security, World Wide Web, Environmental health, Medicine, Cartography, Computer network","University of California, Santa Cruz","Los Gatos High School; University of California, Santa Cruz; Lynbrook Highschool","Los Gatos High School; University of California, Santa Cruz; Lynbrook Highschool"
Residential income segregation: A behavioral model of the housing market,"We represent the functioning of the housing market and study the relation
between income segregation, income inequality and house prices by introducing a
spatial Agent-Based Model (ABM). Differently from traditional models in urban
economics, we explicitly specify the behavior of buyers and sellers and the
price formation mechanism. Buyers who differ by income select among
heterogeneous neighborhoods using a probabilistic model of residential choice;
sellers employ an aspiration level heuristic to set their reservation offer
price; prices are determined through a continuous double auction. We first
provide an approximate analytical solution of the ABM, shedding light on the
structure of the model and on the effect of the parameters. We then simulate
the ABM and find that: (i) a more unequal income distribution lowers the prices
globally, but implies stronger segregation; (ii) a spike of the demand in one
part of the city increases the prices all over the city; (iii) subsidies are
more efficient than taxes in fostering social mixing.",Marco Pangallo; Jean Pierre Nadal; Annick Vignes,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00424v3,False,True,False,False,False,596.0,Jeffrey E Zabel,Boston,Completed,2006.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2019.01.010,"Economics, Microeconomics, Subsidy, Reservation, Distribution (mathematics), Income distribution, Inequality, Computer science, Mathematics, Market economy, Computer network, Mathematical analysis",Centre d'Analyse et de Mathématique Sociales; École nationale des ponts et chaussées; New College; University of Oxford,"Centre d'Analyse et de Mathématique Sociales, École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, 54 bd Raspail, Paris 75006, France; Laboratoire de Physique Statistique, École Normale Supérieure, 24 rue Lhomond, Paris 75231, France; Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, University of Oxford, Oxford OX26ED, UK; École des Ponts ParisTech, 6-8 Avenue Blaise Pascal, Champs-sur-Marne 77455, France; Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford OX13LP, UK","Centre d'Analyse et de Mathématique Sociales, École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, 54 bd Raspail, Paris 75006, France; Laboratoire de Physique Statistique, École Normale Supérieure, 24 rue Lhomond, Paris 75231, France; Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, University of Oxford, Oxford OX26ED, UK; École des Ponts ParisTech, 6-8 Avenue Blaise Pascal, Champs-sur-Marne 77455, France; Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford OX13LP, UK"
The William Kruskal Legacy: 1919--2005,"William Kruskal (Bill) was a distinguished statistician who spent virtually
his entire professional career at the University of Chicago, and who had a
lasting impact on the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and on the field of
statistics more broadly, as well as on many who came in contact with him. Bill
passed away last April following an extended illness, and on May 19, 2005, the
University of Chicago held a memorial service at which several of Bill's
colleagues and collaborators spoke along with members of his family and other
friends. This biography and the accompanying commentaries derive in part from
brief presentations on that occasion, along with recollections and input from
several others. Bill was known personally to most of an older generation of
statisticians as an editor and as an intellectual and professional leader. In
1994, Statistical Science published an interview by Sandy Zabell (Vol. 9,
285--303) in which Bill looked back on selected events in his professional
life. One of the purposes of the present biography and accompanying
commentaries is to reintroduce him to old friends and to introduce him for the

Endogenous Growth Under Multiple Uses of Data,"We model a dynamic data economy with fully endogenous growth where agents
generate data from consumption and share them with innovation and production
firms. Different from other productive factors such as labor or capital, data
are nonrival in their uses across sectors which affect both the level and
growth of economic outputs. Despite the vertical nonrivalry, the innovation
sector dominates the production sector in data usage and contribution to growth
because (i) data are dynamically nonrival and add to knowledge accumulation,
and (ii) innovations ""desensitize"" raw data and enter production as knowledge,
which allays consumers' privacy concerns. Data uses in both sectors interact to
generate spillover of allocative distortion and exhibit an apparent
substitutability due to labor's rivalry and complementarity with data.
Consequently, growth rates under a social planner and a decentralized
equilibrium differ, which is novel in the literature and has policy
implications. Specifically, consumers' failure to fully internalize knowledge
spillover when bearing privacy costs, combined with firms' market power,
underprice data and inefficiently limit their supply, leading to
underemployment in the innovation sector and a suboptimal long-run growth.
Improving data usage efficiency is ineffective in mitigating the
underutilization of data, but interventions in the data market and direct
subsidies hold promises.",Lin William Cong; Wenshi Wei; Danxia Xie; Longtian Zhang,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10027v1,False,True,False,False,False,598.0,William R Kerr,Boston,Completed,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jedc.2022.104395,"Economics, Allocative efficiency, Endogenous growth theory, Panel data, Complementarity (molecular biology), Production (economics), Spillover effect, Microeconomics, Industrial organization, Consumption (sociology), Survey data collection, Human capital, Market economy, Econometrics, Social science, Statistics, Mathematics, Sociology, Biology, Genetics",Cornell University; Central University of Finance and Economics; SC Johnson (United States); Tsinghua University; Institute of Economics,"SC Johnson College of Business, Cornell University, US; School of International Trade and Economics, Central University of Finance and Economics, China; Institute of Economics, Tsinghua University, China","SC Johnson College of Business, Cornell University, US; School of International Trade and Economics, Central University of Finance and Economics, China; Institute of Economics, Tsinghua University, China"
Innovation and informal knowledge exchanges between firms,"Firm clusters are seen as having a positive effect on innovations, what can
be interpreted as economies of scale or knowledge spillovers. The processes
underlying the success of these clusters remain difficult to isolate. We
propose in this paper a stylised agent-based model to test the role of
geographical proximity and informal knowledge exchanges between firms on the
emergence of innovations. The model is run on synthetic firm clusters.
Sensitivity analysis and systematic model exploration unveil a strong impact of
interaction distance on innovations, with a qualitative shift when spatial
interactions are more intense. Model bi-objective optimisation shows a
compromise between innovation and product diversity, suggesting trade-offs for
clusters in practice. This model provides thus a first basis to systematically
explore the interplay between firm cluster geography and innovation, from an

"Janus monolayer TaNF: a new ferrovalley material with large valley
  splitting and tunable magnetic properties","Materials with large intrinsic valley splitting and high Curie temperature
are a huge advantage for studying valleytronics and practical applications. In
this work, using first-principles calculations, a new Janus TaNF monolayer is
predicted to exhibit excellent piezoelectric properties and intrinsic valley
splitting, resulting from the spontaneous spin polarization, the spatial
inversion symmetry breaking and strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). TaNF is also
a potential two-dimensional (2D) magnetic material due to its high Curie
temperature and huge magnetic anisotropy energy. The effective control of the
band gap of TaNF can be achieved by biaxial strain, which can transform TaNF
monolayer from semiconductor to semi-metal. The magnitude of valley splitting
at the CBM can be effectively tuned by biaxial strain due to the changes of
orbital composition at the valleys. The magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) can be
manipulated by changing the energy and occupation (unoccupation) states of d
orbital compositions through biaxial strain. In addition, Curie temperature
reaches 373 K under only -3% biaxial strain, indicating that Janus TaNF
monolayer can be used at high temperatures for spintronic and valleytronic
devices.",Guibo Zheng; Shuixian Qu; Wenzhe Zhou; Fangping Ouyang,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05670v1,False,True,False,False,False,606.0,Allison G Harris,Chicago,Completed,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11467-023-1285-3,"Valleytronics, Condensed matter physics, Curie temperature, Spintronics, Materials science, Janus, Monolayer, Point reflection, Magnetic anisotropy, Anisotropy, Strain engineering, Ferromagnetism, Magnetization, Magnetic field, Physics, Nanotechnology, Optics, Quantum mechanics, Phase transition",Central South University,"State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy, and Powder Metallurgy Research Institute, Central South University, Changsha, 410083, China; School of Physics and Electronics, and Hunan Key Laboratory for Super-Microstructure and Ultrafast Process, and Hunan Key Laboratory of Nanophotonics and Devices, Central South University, Changsha, China","State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy, and Powder Metallurgy Research Institute, Central South University, Changsha, 410083, China; School of Physics and Electronics, and Hunan Key Laboratory for Super-Microstructure and Ultrafast Process, and Hunan Key Laboratory of Nanophotonics and Devices, Central South University, Changsha, China"
Mathematical Modeling of Competition in Sponsored Search Market,"Sponsored search mechanisms have drawn much attention from both academic
community and industry in recent years since the seminal papers of [13] and

of publishers, advertisers and end users in a competitive market. We first
consider the monopoly market model and provide optimal solutions for both ex
ante and ex post cases, which represents the long-term and short-term revenues
of search engines respectively. We then analyze the strategic behaviors of end
users and advertisers under duopoly and prove the existence of equilibrium for
both search engines to co-exist from ex-post perspective. To show the more
general ex ante results, we carry out extensive simulations under different
parameter settings. Our analysis and observation in this work can provide
useful insight in regulating the sponsored search market and protecting the

"A novel association and ranking approach identifies factors affecting
  educational outcomes of STEM majors","Improving undergraduate success in STEM requires identifying actionable
factors that impact student outcomes, allowing institutions to prioritize key
leverage points for change. We examined academic, demographic, and
institutional factors that might be associated with graduation rates at two
four-year colleges in the northeastern United States using a novel association
algorithm called D-basis to rank attributes associated with graduation.
Importantly, the data analyzed included tracking data from the National Student
Clearinghouse on students who left their original institutions to determine
outcomes following transfer.
  Key predictors of successful graduation include performance in introductory
STEM courses, the choice of first mathematics class, and flexibility in major
selection. High grades in introductory biology, general chemistry, and
mathematics courses were strongly correlated with graduation. At the same time,
students who switched majors - especially from STEM to non-STEM - had higher
overall graduation rates. Additionally, Pell eligibility and demographic
factors, though less predictive overall, revealed disparities in time to
graduation and retention rates.
  The findings highlight the importance of early academic support in STEM
gateway courses and the implementation of institutional policies that provide
flexibility in major selection. Enhancing student success in introductory
mathematics, biology, and chemistry courses could greatly influence graduation
rates. Furthermore, customized mathematics pathways and focused support for
STEM courses may assist institutions in optimizing student outcomes. This study
offers data-driven insights to guide strategies to increase STEM degree

weighted. The nodes are represented by the occupations (post coded at 3 digits
according to ISCO-88) and the links are weighted with the number of persons

"Modelling an electricity market oligopoly with a competitive fringe and
  generation investments","Market power behaviour often occurs in modern wholesale electricity markets.
Mixed Complementarity Problems (MCPs) have been typically used for
computational modelling of market power when it is characterised by an
oligopoly with competitive fringe. However, such models can lead to myopic and
contradictory behaviour. Previous works in the literature have suggested using
conjectural variations to overcome this modelling issue. We first show however,
that an oligopoly with competitive fringe where all firms have investment
decisions, will also lead to myopic and contradictory behaviour when modelled
using conjectural variations. Consequently, we develop an Equilibrium Problem
with Equilibrium Constraints (EPEC) to model such an electricity market
structure. The EPEC models two types of players: price-making firms, who have
market power, and price-taking firms, who do not. In addition to generation
decisions, all firms have endogenous investment decisions for multiple new
generating technologies. The results indicate that, when modelling an oligopoly
with a competitive fringe and generation investment decisions, an EPEC model
can represent a more realistic market structure and overcome the myopic
behaviour observed in MCPs. The EPEC considered found multiple equilibria for
investment decisions and firms' profits. However, market prices and consumer
costs were found to remain relatively constant across the equilibria. In
addition, the model shows how it may be optimal for price-making firms to
occasionally sell some of their electricity below marginal cost in order to
de-incentivize price-taking firms from investing further into the market. Such
strategic behaviour would not be captured by MCP or cost-minimisation models.",Mel T.

Strategic Formation and Reliability of Supply Chain Networks,"Supply chains are the backbone of the global economy. Disruptions to them can
be costly. Centrally managed supply chains invest in ensuring their resilience.
Decentralized supply chains, however, must rely upon the self-interest of their
individual components to maintain the resilience of the entire chain.
  We examine the incentives that independent self-interested agents have in
forming a resilient supply chain network in the face of production disruptions
and competition. In our model, competing suppliers are subject to yield
uncertainty (they deliver less than ordered) and congestion (lead time
uncertainty or, ""soft"" supply caps). Competing retailers must decide which
suppliers to link to based on both price and reliability. In the presence of
yield uncertainty only, the resulting supply chain networks are sparse.
Retailers concentrate their links on a single supplier, counter to the idea
that they should mitigate yield uncertainty by diversifying their supply base.
This happens because retailers benefit from supply variance. It suggests that
competition will amplify output uncertainty. When congestion is included as
well, the resulting networks are denser and resemble the bipartite expander
graphs that have been proposed in the supply chain literature, thereby,
providing the first example of endogenous formation of resilient supply chain
networks, without resilience being explicitly encoded in payoffs. Finally, we
show that a supplier's investments in improved yield can make it worse off.
This happens because high production output saturates the market, which, in
turn lowers prices and profits for participants.",Victor Amelkin; Rakesh Vohra,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08021v2,False,True,False,False,False,615.0,Kristina S Steffenson McElheran,Chicago,Completed,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1145/3391403.3399450,"Supply chain, Yield (engineering), Reliability (semiconductor), Incentive, Competition (biology), Industrial organization, Variance (accounting), Business, Strategic sourcing, Supply chain management, Microeconomics, Bullwhip effect, Computer science, Risk analysis (engineering), Economics, Marketing, Strategic planning, Power (physics), Physics, Quantum mechanics, Ecology, Materials science, Accounting, Strategic financial management, Biology, Metallurgy",University of Pennsylvania,"University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA","University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"
"Deep Learning Framework for Measuring the Digital Strategy of Companies

as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and cloud computing. However, many
companies report that their strategies did not achieve the anticipated business
results. This study is the first to apply state of the art NLP models on
unstructured data to understand the different clusters of digital strategy
patterns that companies are Adopting. We achieve this by analyzing earnings
calls from Fortune Global 500 companies between 2015 and 2019. We use
Transformer based architecture for text classification which show a better
understanding of the conversation context. We then investigate digital strategy
patterns by applying clustering analysis. Our findings suggest that Fortune 500
companies use four distinct strategies which are product led, customer

"Earning Maximization with Quality of Charging Service Guarantee for IoT
  Devices","Resonant Beam Charging (RBC) is a promising Wireless Power Transfer (WPT)
technology to provide long-range, high-power, mobile and safe wireless power
for the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The Point-to-Multipoint (PtMP) RBC
system can charge multiple receivers simultaneously similar to WiFi
communications. To guarantee the Quality of Charging Service (QoCS) for each
receiver and maximize the overall earning in the PtMP RBC service, we specify
the Charging Pricing Strategy (CPS) and develop the High Priority Charge (HPC)
scheduling algorithm to control the charging order and power allocation. Each
receiver is assigned a priority, which is updated dynamically based on its
State of Charging (SOC) and specified charging power. The receivers with high
priorities are scheduled to be charged in each time slot. We present the pseudo
code of the HPC algorithm based on quantifying the receiver's SOC, discharging
energy and various relevant parameters. Relying on simulation analysis, we
demonstrate that the HPC algorithm can achieve better QoCS and earning than the
Round-Robin Charge (RRC) scheduling algorithm. Based on the performance
evaluation, we illustrate that the methods to improve the PtMP RBC service are:
1) limiting the receiver number within a reasonable range and 2) prolonging the
charging duration as long as possible. In summary, the HPC scheduling algorithm
provides a practical strategy to maximize the earning of the PtMP RBC service
with each receiver's QoCS guarantee.",Wen Fang; Qingqing Zhang; Mingqing Liu; Qingwen Liu; Pengfei Xia,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09520v1,False,True,False,False,False,621.0,Thomas Hubbard,Chicago,Completed,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.1109/jiot.2018.2868226,"Computer science, Scheduling (production processes), Quality of service, Wireless, Wireless power transfer, Maximization, Computer network, Real-time computing, Telecommunications, Mathematical optimization, Mathematics",Tongji University,"College of Electronic and Information Engineering Tongji University, Shanghai, China","College of Electronic and Information Engineering Tongji University, Shanghai, China"

"How residence permits affect the labor market attachment of foreign
  workers: Evidence from a migration lottery in Liechtenstein","We analyze the impact of obtaining a residence permit on foreign workers'
labor market and residential attachment. To overcome the usually severe
selection issues, we exploit a unique migration lottery that randomly assigns
access to otherwise restricted residence permits in Liechtenstein (situated
between Austria and Switzerland). Using an instrumental variable approach, our
results show that lottery compliers (whose migration behavior complies with the
assignment in their first lottery) raise their employment probability in
Liechtenstein by on average 24 percentage points across outcome periods (2008
to 2018) as a result of receiving a permit. Relatedly, their activity level and
employment duration in Liechtenstein increase by on average 20 percentage
points and 1.15 years, respectively, over the outcome window. These substantial
and statistically significant effects are mainly driven by individuals not
(yet) working in Liechtenstein prior to the lottery rather than by previous
cross-border commuters. Moreover, we find both the labor market and residential
effects to be persistent even several years after the lottery with no sign of
fading out. These results suggest that granting resident permits to foreign
workers can be effective to foster labor supply even beyond the effect of
cross-border commuting from adjacent regions.",Berno Buechel; Selina Gangl; Martin Huber,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11840v1,False,True,False,False,False,628.0,Jennifer A Heerwig,Baruch,Completed,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2023.104377,"Lottery, Residence, Labour economics, Demographic economics, Economics, Outcome (game theory), Instrumental variable, Affect (linguistics), Situated, Psychology, Microeconomics, Econometrics, Communication, Artificial intelligence, Computer science",University of Fribourg; Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,"University of Fribourg, Department of Economics, Switzerland; Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Department of Economics, Germany","University of Fribourg, Department of Economics, Switzerland; Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Department of Economics, Germany"
"Gender gaps in frontier entrepreneurship? Evidence from 1901 Oklahoma
  land lottery winners","The paper investigates gender differences in entrepreneurship by exploiting a
large-scale land lottery in Oklahoma at the turn of the 20$^{\text{th}}$
century. Lottery winners claimed land in the order in which their names were
drawn, so the draw number is an approximate rank ordering of lottery wealth.
This mechanism allows for the estimation of a dose-response function, which
relates each draw number to the expected outcome under each draw. I estimate
dose-response functions on a linked dataset of lottery winners and land patent
records, and find the probability of purchasing land from the government to be
decreasing as a function of lottery wealth, which is evidence for the presence
of liquidity constraints. I find female winners were more effective in
leveraging lottery wealth to purchase additional land, as evidenced by
significantly higher median dose-responses compared to those of male winners.
For a sample of winners linked to the 1910 Census, I find that male winners
have higher median dose-responses compared to female winners in terms of farm
or home ownership. These results suggest that liquidity constraints may have
been more binding for female entrepreneurs in the market economy.",Jason Poulos,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14922v3,False,True,False,False,False,628.0,Jennifer A Heerwig,Baruch,Completed,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.1561/115.00000042,"Frontier, Lottery, Entrepreneurship, Economic geography, Political science, Demographic economics, Economics, Geography, Sociology, Economic growth, Law, Microeconomics",Harvard University,"Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School, USA","Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School, USA"
Payday loans -- blessing or growth suppressor? Machine Learning Analysis,"The upsurge of real estate involves a variety of factors that have got
influenced by many domains. Indeed, the unrecognized sector that would affect
the economy for which regulatory proposals are being drafted to keep this in

area of reference by virtue of payday loans in Toronto, Ontario in particular,
which sets out an ideology to create, evaluate and demonstrate the scenario
through research analysis. The purpose of this indexing via payday loans is the
basic - debt: income ratio which states that when the income of the person

"Credit Cycles, Securitization, and Credit Default Swaps","We present a limits-to-arbitrage model to study the impact of securitization,
leverage and credit risk protection on the cyclicity of bank credit. In a
stable bank credit situation, no cycles of credit expansion or contraction
appear. Unlevered securitization together with mis-pricing of securitized
assets increases lending cyclicality, favoring credit booms and busts. Leverage
changes the state of affairs with respect to the simple securitization. First,
the volume of real activity and banking profits increases. Second, banks sell
securities when markets decline. This selling puts further pressure on falling
prices. The mis-pricing of credit risk protection or securitized assets
influences the real economy. Trading in these contracts reduces the amount of
funding available to entrepreneurs, particularly to high-credit-risk borrowers.
This trading decreases the liquidity of the securitized assets, and especially
those based on investments with high credit risk.",Juan Ignacio Peña,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00177v1,False,True,False,False,False,640.0,Brian T Melzer,Chicago,Completed,2012.0,,"Securitization, Leverage (statistics), Business, Credit enhancement, Financial system, Credit risk, Credit default swap, Credit derivative, Market liquidity, Monetary economics, Credit history, Finance, Economics, Credit reference, Machine learning, Computer science",,,
"Modelling air pollution abatement in deep street canyons by means of air
  scrubbers","Deep street canyons are characterized by weak ventilation and recirculation
of air. In such environment, the exposure to particulate matter and other air
pollutants is enhanced, with a consequent worsening of both safety and health.
The main solution adopted by the international community is aimed at the
reduction of the emissions. In this theoretical study, we test a new solution:
the removal of air pollutants close to their sources by a network of Air
Pollution Abatement (APA) devices. The APA technology depletes gaseous and
particulate air pollutants by a portable and low-consuming scrubbing system,
that mimics the processes of wet and dry deposition. We estimate the potential
pollutant abatement efficacy of a single absorber by Computational Fluid
Dynamics (CFD) method. The presence of the scrubber effectively creates an
additional sink at the bottom of the canyon, accelerating its cleaning process
by up to 70%, when an almost perfect scrubber (90% efficiency) is simulated.
The efficacy of absorber is not proportional to its internal abatement
efficiency, but it increases rapidly at low efficiencies, then tends to
saturate. In the particular configuration of the canyon we choose (aspect ratio
of 3) the upwind corner is the most favourable for the absorber application. In
the downwind corner the maximum pollutant abatement is -24%, while in the
upwind corner the maximum abatement is twice as much at -51%. The efficacy of
the absorber increases much faster at low efficiencies: at 25% efficiency, the
abatement is already about half that obtained with the 90% efficiency. These
first results, suggest strategies for the real-world application of a network
of absorbers, and motivates further theoretical study to better characterize
the details of the air flow inside and around the absorber.",Marina De Giovanni; Gabriele Curci; Alessandro Avveduto; Lorenzo Pace; Cesare Dari Salisburgo; Franco Giammaria; Alessio Monaco; Giuseppe Spanto; Paolo Tripodi,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06088v1,False,True,False,False,False,642.0,Wayne Gray,Boston,Completed,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1506.06088,"Scrubber, Street canyon, Canyon, Environmental science, Air pollution, Pollution, Meteorology, Environmental engineering, Waste management, Engineering, Geography, Cartography, Chemistry, Ecology, Organic chemistry, Biology",,,
"Identification of Key Companies for International Profit Shifting in the
  Global Ownership Network","In the global economy, the intermediate companies owned by multinational
corporations are becoming an important policy issue as they are likely to cause
international profit shifting and diversion of foreign direct investments. The
purpose of this analysis is to call the intermediate companies with high risk
of international profit shifting as key firms and to identifying and clarify
them. For this aim, we propose a model that focuses on each affiliate's
position on the ownership structure of each multinational corporation. Based on
the information contained in the Orbis database, we constructed the Global
Ownership Network, reflecting the relationship that can give significant
influence to a firm, and analyzed for large multinational corporations listed
in Fortune Global 500. In this analysis, first, we confirmed the validity of
this model by identifying affiliates playing an important role in international
tax avoidance at a certain degree. Secondly, intermediate companies are mainly
found in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, etc., and tended to be located
in jurisdictions favorable to treaty shopping. And it was found that such key
firms are concentrated on the IN component of the bow-tie structure that the
giant weakly connected component of the Global Ownership Network consist of.
Therefore, it clarifies that the key firms are geographically located in
specific jurisdictions, and concentrates on specific components in the Global
Ownership Network. The location of key firms are related with the ease of
treaty shopping, and there is a difference in the jurisdiction where key firms
are located depending on the location of the multinational corporations.",Tembo Nakamoto; Abhijit Chakraborty; Yuichi Ikeda,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12397v1,False,True,False,False,False,655.0,Maria Borga,Washington,Completed,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-019-0158-8,"Multinational corporation, Business, Jurisdiction, Foreign direct investment, Treaty, Profit (economics), Industrial organization, Key (lock), International trade, Finance, Economics, Political science, Law, Macroeconomics, Microeconomics, Ecology, Biology",University of Hyogo; Kyoto University,"Graduate School of Simulation Studies, University of Hyogo, 7-1-28, Minatojima-minamimachi, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 6500047, Japan; Graduate school of Advanced Integrated Studies in Human Survivability, Kyoto University, 1, Yoshida-Nakaadachi-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 6068306, Japan","Graduate School of Simulation Studies, University of Hyogo, 7-1-28, Minatojima-minamimachi, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 6500047, Japan; Graduate school of Advanced Integrated Studies in Human Survivability, Kyoto University, 1, Yoshida-Nakaadachi-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 6068306, Japan"
"How should we proxy for race/ethnicity? Comparing Bayesian improved
  surname geocoding to machine learning methods","Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) is the most popular method for
proxying race/ethnicity in voter registration files that do not contain it.
This paper benchmarks BISG against a range of previously untested machine
learning alternatives, using voter files with self-reported race/ethnicity from
California, Florida, North Carolina, and Georgia. This analysis yields three
key findings. First, machine learning consistently outperforms BISG at
individual classification of race/ethnicity. Second, BISG and machine learning
methods exhibit divergent biases for estimating regional racial composition.
Third, the performance of all methods varies substantially across states. These
results suggest that pre-trained machine learning models are preferable to BISG
for individual classification. Furthermore, mixed results across states

findings in the social sciences (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004). We design a
series of templatic prompts to LLMs to write an email to a named job applicant
informing them of a hiring decision. By manipulating the applicant's first
name, we measure the effect of perceived race, ethnicity, and gender on the
probability that the LLM generates an acceptance or rejection email. We find
that the hiring decisions of LLMs in many settings are more likely to favor
White applicants over Hispanic applicants. In aggregate, the groups with the
highest and lowest acceptance rates respectively are masculine White names and
masculine Hispanic names. However, the comparative acceptance rates by group

'Entanglement' -- A new dynamic metric to measure team flow,"We introduce ""entanglement"", a novel metric to measure how synchronized
communication between team members is. This measure calculates the Euclidean
distance among team members' social network metrics timeseries. We validate the
metric with four case studies. The first case study uses entanglement of 11
medical innovation teams to predict team performance and learning behavior. The
second case looks at the e-mail communication of 113 senior executives of an
international services firm, predicting employee turnover through lack of
entanglement of an employee. The third case analyzes the individual employee
performance of 81 managers. The fourth case study predicts performance of 13
customer-dedicated teams at a big international company by comparing
entanglement in the e-mail interactions with satisfaction of their customers
measured through Net Promoter Score (NPS). While we can only speculate about
what is causing the entanglement effect, we find that it is a new and versatile
indicator for the analysis of employees' communication, analyzing the hitherto
underused temporal dimension of online social networks which could be used as a
powerful predictor of employee and team performance, employee turnover, and
customer satisfaction.",P. A. Gloor; M. P. Zylka; A. Fronzetti Colladon; M.

Did Hurricane Katrina Reduce Mortality?,"In a recent article in the American Economic Review, Tatyana Deryugina and
David Molitor (DM) analyzed the effect of Hurricane Katrina on the mortality of
elderly and disabled residents of New Orleans. The authors concluded that
Hurricane Katrina improved the eight-year survival rate of elderly and disabled
residents of New Orleans by 3% and that most of this decline in mortality was
due to declines in mortality among those who moved to places with lower
mortality. In this article, I provide a critical assessment of the evidence
provided by DM to support their conclusions. There are three main problems.
First, DM generally fail to account for the fact that people of different ages,
races or sex will have different probabilities of dying as time goes by, and
when they do allow for this, results change markedly. Second, DM do not account
for the fact that residents in New Orleans are likely to be selected
non-randomly on the basis of health because of the relatively high mortality
rate in New Orleans compared to the rest of the country. Third, there is
considerable evidence that among those who moved from New Orleans, the
destination chosen was non-random. Finally, DM never directly assessed changes
in mortality of those who moved, or stayed, in New Orleans before and after
Hurricane Katrina. These problems lead me to conclude that the evidence
presented by DM does not support their inferences.",Robert Kaestner,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03392v2,False,True,False,False,False,664.0,Narayan Sastry,Michigan,Completed,2012.0,,"Hurricane katrina, Demography, Mortality rate, Gerontology, Natural disaster, Rest (music), Geography, History, Medicine, Sociology, Meteorology, Cardiology",,,
"Design of the Millennium Villages Project Sampling Plan: a simulation
  study for a multi-module survey","The Millennium Villages Project (MVP) is a ten-year integrated rural
development project implemented in ten sub-Saharan African sites. At its
conclusion we will conduct an evaluation of its causal effect on a variety of
development outcomes, measured via household surveys in treatment and
comparison areas. Outcomes are measured by six survey modules, with sample
sizes for each demographic group determined by budget, logistics, and the
group's vulnerability. We design a sampling plan that aims to reduce effort for
survey enumerators and maximize precision for all outcomes. We propose
two-stage sampling designs, sampling households at the first stage, followed by
a second stage sample that differs across demographic groups. Two-stage designs
are usually constructed by simple random sampling (SRS) of households and
proportional within-household sampling, or probability proportional to size
sampling (PPS) of households with fixed sampling within each. No measure of
household size is proportional for all demographic groups, putting PPS schemes
at a disadvantage. The SRS schemes have the disadvantage that multiple
individuals sampled per household decreases efficiency due to intra-household
correlation. We conduct a simulation study (using both design- and model-based
survey inference) to understand these tradeoffs and recommend a sampling plan
for the Millennium Villages Project. Similar design issues arise in other
studies with surveys that target different demographic groups.",Shira Mitchell; Rebecca Ross; Susanna Makela; Elizabeth A. Stuart; Avi Feller; Alan M.

"Time Varying Risk in U.S. Housing Sector and Real Estate Investment
  Trusts Equity Return","This study examines how housing sector volatilities affect real estate
investment trust (REIT) equity return in the United States. I argue that
unexpected changes in housing variables can be a source of aggregate housing
risk, and the first principal component extracted from the volatilities of U.S.
housing variables can predict the expected REIT equity returns. I propose and
construct a factor-based housing risk index as an additional factor in asset
price models that uses the time-varying conditional volatility of housing
variables within the U.S. housing sector. The findings show that the proposed
housing risk index is economically and theoretically consistent with the
risk-return relationship of the conditional Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing
Model (ICAPM) of Merton (1973), which predicts an average maximum of 5.6
percent of risk premium in REIT equity return. In subsample analyses, the
positive relationship is not affected by sample periods' choice but shows
higher housing risk beta values for the 2009-18 sample period. The relationship
remains significant after controlling for VIX, Fama-French three factors, and a

A Distributed Trust Framework for Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning,"When training a machine learning model, it is standard procedure for the
researcher to have full knowledge of both the data and model. However, this
engenders a lack of trust between data owners and data scientists. Data owners
are justifiably reluctant to relinquish control of private information to third
parties. Privacy-preserving techniques distribute computation in order to
ensure that data remains in the control of the owner while learning takes
place. However, architectures distributed amongst multiple agents introduce an
entirely new set of security and trust complications. These include data
poisoning and model theft. This paper outlines a distributed infrastructure
which is used to facilitate peer-to-peer trust between distributed agents;
collaboratively performing a privacy-preserving workflow. Our outlined
prototype sets industry gatekeepers and governance bodies as credential
issuers. Before participating in the distributed learning workflow, malicious
actors must first negotiate valid credentials. We detail a proof of concept

What You See is What You Get: Local Labor Markets and Skill Acquisition,"This paper highlights the potential for negative dynamic consequences of
recent trends towards the formation of ""skill-hubs"". I first show evidence that
skill acquisition is biased towards skills which are in demand in local labor
markets. This fact along with large heterogeneity in outcomes by major and
recent reductions in migration rates implies a significant potential for
inefficient skill upgrading over time. To evaluate the impact of local bias in
education in the context of standard models which focus on agglomeration
effects, I develop a structural spatial model which includes educational
investment. The model focuses on two sources of externalities: productivity
through agglomeration and signaling. Both of these affect educational decisions
tilting the balance of aggregate skill composition. Signaling externalities can

"Cost-benefit Analysis And Comparisons For Different Offshore Wind Energy
  Transmission Systems","This paper investigates how to efficiently and economically deliver offshore
energy generated by offshore wind turbines to onshore. Both power cables and
hydrogen energy facilities are analyzed. Each method is examined with the
associated proposed optimal sizing model. A cost-benefit analysis is conducted,
and these methods are compared under different scenarios. Three long-distance
energy transmission methods are proposed to transmit offshore energy onshore,
considering the capital/operation costs for related energy conversion and
transmission facilities. The first method that deploys power cables only is a
benchmark method. The other two methods utilize a hydrogen supercenter (HSC)
and transmit offshore energy to and onshore substation through hydrogen
pipelines. For the second method, electrolyzers are placed at offshore wind
farms connected to HSC with low-pressure hydrogen pipelines. For the third
method, offshore wind power is distributed to the HSC and then converted into
hydrogen using electrolyzers placed at the HSC. An offshore scenario including
three wind farms located in the Gulf of Mexico and one onshore substation is
used as the base test case. Numerical simulations are conducted over a planning
period of 30 years using the proposed optimization models for each method
separately. Simulation results show that the proposed hydrogen-based methods
can effectively transmit offshore energy to the onshore substation. The
distances between the wind farms can influence the selection and configuration
of the offshore wind energy system. Moreover, the proposed study analyzes the
cost and benefits for various systems with different energy carriers. It can
also suggest which method could be the best candidate for offshore energy
delivery system under which scenario and demonstrate a promising future for
offshore wind power generation.",Jesus Silva-Rodriguez; Jin Lu; Xingpeng Li,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11208v1,False,True,False,False,False,682.0,Jooyoun Park,Michigan,Completed,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2301.11208,"Offshore wind power, Marine engineering, Submarine pipeline, Capital cost, Wind power, Benchmark (surveying), Pipeline transport, Sizing, Environmental science, Engineering, Geology, Environmental engineering, Electrical engineering, Geotechnical engineering, Art, Geodesy, Visual arts",,,
Influence of primary particle density in the morphology of agglomerates,"Agglomeration processes occur in many different realms of science such as
colloid and aerosol formation or formation of bacterial colonies. We study the
influence of primary particle density in agglomerate structure using
diffusion-controlled Monte Carlo simulations with realistic space scales
through different regimes (DLA and DLCA). The equivalence of Monte Carlo time
steps to real time scales is given by Hirsch's hydrodynamical theory of
Brownian motion. Agglomerate behavior at different time stages of the
simulations suggests that three indices (fractal exponent, coordination number
and eccentricity index) characterize agglomerate geometry. Using these indices,
we have found that the initial density of primary particles greatly influences
the final structure of the agglomerate as observed in recent experimental
works.",M. D. Camejo; D. R. Espeso; L. L.

Bayesian Agency: Linear versus Tractable Contracts,"We study principal-agent problems in which a principal commits to an
outcome-dependent payment scheme (a.k.a. contract) so as to induce an agent to
take a costly, unobservable action. We relax the assumption that the principal
perfectly knows the agent by considering a Bayesian setting where the agent's
type is unknown and randomly selected according to a given probability
distribution, which is known to the principal. Each agent's type is
characterized by her own action costs and action-outcome distributions. In the
literature on non-Bayesian principal-agent problems, considerable attention has
been devoted to linear contracts, which are simple, pure-commission payment
schemes that still provide nice approximation guarantees with respect to
principal-optimal (possibly non-linear) contracts. While in non-Bayesian
settings an optimal contract can be computed efficiently, this is no longer the
case for our Bayesian principal-agent problems. This further motivates our
focus on linear contracts, which can be optimized efficiently given their
single-parameter nature. Our goal is to analyze the properties of linear
contracts in Bayesian settings, in terms of approximation guarantees with
respect to optimal contracts and general tractable contracts (i.e.,
efficiently-computable ones). First, we study the approximation guarantees of
linear contracts with respect to optimal ones, showing that the former suffer
from a multiplicative loss linear in the number of agent's types. Nevertheless,
we prove that linear contracts can still provide a constant multiplicative
approximation $\rho$ of the optimal principal's expected utility, though at the
expense of an exponentially-small additive loss $2^{-\Omega(\rho)}$. Then, we
switch to tractable contracts, showing that, surprisingly, linear contracts
perform well among them.",Matteo Castiglioni; Alberto Marchesi; Nicola Gatti,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00319v1,False,True,False,False,False,686.0,Sandra Campo,Triangle,Completed,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1145/3465456.3467602,"Bayesian probability, Agency (philosophy), Computer science, Econometrics, Mathematics, Artificial intelligence, Sociology, Social science",Politecnico di Milano,"Politecnico di Milano, milano, Italy","Politecnico di Milano, milano, Italy"
"Mediating role of managing information technology and its impact on firm
  performance: insight from China","Purpose: Managing IT with firm performance has always been a debatable topic
in literature and practice. Prior studies examining the above relationship have
reported mixed results and have yet ignored the eminent managing IT practices.
The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the relevance of ValIT
2.0 practice in managing IT investment, and its mediating role in the firm
performance context. Design,methodology,approach:This paper developed on two
themes of literature. First managing IT as a firm's IT capability in order to
generate value from IT investment. Second IT as a firm's resource under
resource-based view offers firm's competence that deploys potentials in
achieving firm performance. The structural equation modeling with PLS
techniques used for analyzing data collected from 176 organization's IT, and
business executives in China. Findings: The results of this study show
empirical evidence that Val-IT's components (value governance, portfolio
management, and investment management) are significantly linked to the
management of IT, and it found to be a significant mediator between Val-IT
components and firm performance. Research implications: This research
contributes to the literature and practice by way of highlighting the value
generation through managing IT on firm performance. Originality: This study is
fully based on ValIT 2.0 with the firm performance where the managing IT
mediate this relationship in a country-specific study in China. This study adds
to the Chinese information system literature which suffers the lack of
empirical studies in the context of management of IT research.",Aboobucker Ilmudeen; Yukun Bao,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08934v1,False,True,False,False,False,695.0,G.

Socioeconomic biases in urban mixing patterns of US metropolitan areas,"Urban areas serve as melting pots of people with diverse socioeconomic
backgrounds, who may not only be segregated but have characteristic mobility
patterns in the city. While mobility is driven by individual needs and
preferences, the specific choice of venues to visit is usually constrained by
the socioeconomic status of people. The complex interplay between people and
places they visit, given their personal attributes and homophily leaning, is a
key mechanism behind the emergence of socioeconomic stratification patterns
ultimately leading to urban segregation at large. Here we investigate mixing
patterns of mobility in the twenty largest cities of the United States by
coupling individual check-in data from the social location platform Foursquare
with census information from the American Community Survey. We find strong
signs of stratification indicating that people mostly visit places in their own
socioeconomic class, occasionally visiting locations from higher classes. The
intensity of this `upwards bias' increases with socioeconomic status and
correlates with standard measures of racial residential segregation. Our
results indicate an even stronger socioeconomic segregation in individual
mobility than one would expect from system-level distributions, shedding
further light on uneven mobility mixing patterns in cities.",Rafiazka Millanida Hilman; Gerardo Iñiguez; Márton Karsai,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04183v1,False,True,False,False,True,704.0,Melissa N Scopilliti,Washington,Completed,2011.0,https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-022-00341-x,"Socioeconomic status, Metropolitan area, Homophily, Geography, Social stratification, Census, Social mobility, Social class, Demographic economics, Demography, Sociology, Psychology, Social psychology, Population, Political science, Economics, Social science, Archaeology, Law",Central European University,"Department of Network and Data Science, Central European University, 1100, Vienna, Austria","Department of Network and Data Science, Central European University, 1100, Vienna, Austria"
"Every Corporation Owns Its Structure: Corporate Credit Ratings via Graph
  Neural Networks","Credit rating is an analysis of the credit risks associated with a
corporation, which reflects the level of the riskiness and reliability in
investing, and plays a vital role in financial risk. There have emerged many
studies that implement machine learning and deep learning techniques which are
based on vector space to deal with corporate credit rating. Recently,
considering the relations among enterprises such as loan guarantee network,
some graph-based models are applied in this field with the advent of graph
neural networks. But these existing models build networks between corporations
without taking the internal feature interactions into account. In this paper,
to overcome such problems, we propose a novel model, Corporate Credit Rating
via Graph Neural Networks, CCR-GNN for brevity. We firstly construct individual
graphs for each corporation based on self-outer product and then use GNN to
model the feature interaction explicitly, which includes both local and global
information. Extensive experiments conducted on the Chinese public-listed
corporate rating dataset, prove that CCR-GNN outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods consistently.",Bojing Feng; Haonan Xu; Wenfang Xue; Bindang Xue,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01933v1,False,True,False,False,False,705.0,Xavier A Giroud,Boston,Completed,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-18907-4_53,"Corporation, Artificial neural network, Artificial intelligence, Graph, Credit rating, Computer science, Feature vector, Loan, Machine learning, Feature (linguistics), Reliability (semiconductor), Business, Finance, Power (physics), Theoretical computer science, Linguistics, Philosophy, Physics, Quantum mechanics",Institute of Automation; Beihang University,"School of Astronautics, Beihang University, Beijing, China; Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing, National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing, China","School of Astronautics, Beihang University, Beijing, China; Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing, National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing, China"
Dynamic Windows Scheduling with Reallocation,"We consider the Windows Scheduling problem. The problem is a restricted
version of Unit-Fractions Bin Packing, and it is also called Inventory
Replenishment in the context of Supply Chain. In brief, the problem is to
schedule the use of communication channels to clients. Each client ci is
characterized by an active cycle and a window wi. During the period of time
that any given client ci is active, there must be at least one transmission
from ci scheduled in any wi consecutive time slots, but at most one
transmission can be carried out in each channel per time slot. The goal is to
minimize the number of channels used. We extend previous online models, where
decisions are permanent, assuming that clients may be reallocated at some cost.
We assume that such cost is a constant amount paid per reallocation. That is,
we aim to minimize also the number of reallocations. We present three online
reallocation algorithms for Windows Scheduling. We evaluate experimentally
these protocols showing that, in practice, all three achieve constant amortized
reallocations with close to optimal channel usage. Our simulations also expose
interesting trade-offs between reallocations and channel usage. We introduce a
new objective function for WS with reallocations, that can be also applied to
models where reallocations are not possible. We analyze this metric for one of
the algorithms which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first online WS
protocol with theoretical guarantees that applies to scenarios where clients
may leave and the analysis is against current load rather than peak load. Using
previous results, we also observe bounds on channel usage for one of the
algorithms.",Martin Farach-Colton; Katia Leal; Miguel A.

"Skill-Based Labor Market Polarization in the Age of AI: A Comparative
  Analysis of India and the United States","This paper examines labor market polarization through a comparative analysis
of skill-based employment and wage distributions in India and the United States
during 2018-2023, with particular attention to differential automation risks
and AI preparedness. Using detailed occupation-level data, automation risk
metrics, and a series of statistical tests including wage premium analysis,
employment share tests, and wage-employment regressions, we document
significant structural differences in labor markets between developing and
developed economies. Our analysis yields four key findings. First, we find
statistically significant differences in employment distribution patterns, with
India showing disproportionate concentration in low-skill employment compared
to the US, particularly in occupations with high automation risk. Second,
regression analysis reveals that wage premiums differ systematically between
the two countries, with significantly larger skill-based wage gaps in India.
Third, we find robust evidence of a negative relationship between employment
size and wages, suggesting stronger labor supply effects in developing
economies. Fourth, analysis of occupation-specific automation risk reveals that
developing economies face a ""double vulnerability"" - concentration of
employment in both low-skill occupations and jobs with higher automation
potential, complicated by lower AI preparedness scores. These findings provide
novel empirical evidence on how development stages influence labor market
polarization patterns and carry important implications for skill development
and technology adoption policies in developing economies. Our results suggest
that traditional approaches to labor market development may need significant
modification to account for the differential impacts of AI across development
stages.",Venkat Ram Reddy Ganuthula; Krishna Kumar Balaraman,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15809v2,False,True,False,False,False,708.0,Robin M Leichenko,Baruch,Completed,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2501.15809,"Polarization (electrochemistry), Economics, Labour economics, Political science, Demographic economics, Chemistry, Physical chemistry",,,
"Business Cycle Synchronization in the EU: A Regional-Sectoral Look
  through Soft-Clustering and Wavelet Decomposition","This paper elaborates on the sectoral-regional view of the business cycle
synchronization in the EU -- a necessary condition for the optimal currency
area. We argue that complete and tidy clustering of the data improves the
decision maker's understanding of the business cycle and, by extension, the
quality of economic decisions. We define the business cycles by applying a
wavelet approach to drift-adjusted gross value added data spanning over 2000Q1
to 2021Q2. For the application of the synchronization analysis, we propose the
novel soft-clustering approach, which adjusts hierarchical clustering in
several aspects. First, the method relies on synchronicity dissimilarity
measures, noting that, for time series data, the feature space is the set of
all points in time. Then, the ``soft'' part of the approach strengthens the
synchronization signal by using silhouette measures. Finally, we add a
probabilistic sparsity algorithm to drop out the most asynchronous ``noisy''
data improving the silhouette scores of the most and less synchronous groups.
The method, hence, splits the sectoral-regional data into three groups: the
synchronous group that shapes the EU business cycle; the less synchronous group
that may hint at cycle forecasting relevant information; the asynchronous group
that may help investors to diversify through-the-cycle risks of the investment
portfolios. The results support the core-periphery hypothesis.",Saulius Jokubaitis; Dmitrij Celov,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14128v1,False,True,False,False,False,712.0,Nicholas A Bloom,Berkeley,Completed,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41549-023-00090-4,"Synchronization (alternating current), Cluster analysis, Business cycle, Computer science, Asynchronous communication, Economics, Artificial intelligence, Telecommunications, Channel (broadcasting), Keynesian economics",Vilnius University,"Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Institute of Applied Mathematics, Vilnius University, Naugarduko st. 24, LT-03225, Vilnius, Lithuania","Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Institute of Applied Mathematics, Vilnius University, Naugarduko st. 24, LT-03225, Vilnius, Lithuania"
Testing Business Cycle Theories: Evidence from the Great Recession,"Empirical business cycle studies using cross-country data usually cannot
achieve causal relationships while within-country studies mostly focus on the
bust period. We provide the first causal investigation into the boom period of
the 1999-2010 U.S. cross-metropolitan business cycle. Using a novel research
design, we show that credit expansion in private-label mortgages causes a
differentially stronger boom (2000-2006) and bust (2007-2010) cycle in the
house-related industries in the high net-export-growth areas. Most importantly,
our unique research design enables us to perform the most comprehensive tests
on theories (hypotheses) regarding the business cycle. We show that the
following theories (hypotheses) cannot explain the cause of the 1999-2010 U.S.

"Planning Optimal From the Firm Value Creation Perspective Levels of
  Operating Cash Investments","The basic financial purpose of corporation is creation of its value.
Liquidity management should also contribute to realization of this fundamental
aim. Many of the current asset management models that are found in financial
management literature assume book profit maximization as the basic financial
purpose. These book profit based models could be lacking in what relates to
another aim like maximization of enterprise value. The corporate value creation
strategy is executed with a focus on risk and uncertainty. Firms hold cash for
a variety of reasons. Generally, cash balances held in a firm can be called
considered, precautionary, speculative, transactional and intentional. The
first are the result of management anxieties. Managers fear the negative part
of the risk and hold cash to hedge against it. Second, cash balances are held
to use chances that are created by the positive part of the risk equation.
Next, cash balances are the result of the operating needs of the firm. In this
article, we analyze the relation between these types of cash balances and risk.
This article presents the discussion about relations between firm net working
investment policy and as result operating cash balances and firm value. This
article also contains propositions for marking levels of precautionary cash
balances and speculative cash balances. Application of these propositions

exceptions, political scientists have not theorized about GPTs. Drawing from
the economics literature on GPTs, we distill several propositions on how and
when GPTs affect military affairs. We call these effects general-purpose
military transformations. In particular, we argue that the impacts of GMTs on
military effectiveness are broad, delayed, and shaped by indirect productivity
spillovers. Additionally, GMTs differentially advantage those militaries that
can draw from a robust industrial base in the GPT. To illustrate the
explanatory value of our theory, we conduct a case study of the military
consequences of electricity, the prototypical GPT. Finally, we apply our
findings to artificial intelligence, which will plausibly cause a profound

many studies to assess how biomarker trajectories predict health outcomes.
Existing methods primarily focus on mean biomarker profiles, treating
variability as a nuisance. However, excess variability may indicate system
dysregulations that may be associated with poor outcomes. In this paper, we
address the long-standing problem of using variability information of multiple
longitudinal biomarkers in time-to-event analyses by formulating and studying a
Bayesian joint model. We first model multiple longitudinal biomarkers, some of
which are subject to limit-of-detection censoring. We then model the survival
times by incorporating random effects and variances from the longitudinal
component as predictors through threshold regression that admits
non-proportional hazards. We demonstrate the operating characteristics of the
proposed joint model through simulations and apply it to data from the Study of
Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) to investigate the impact of the mean

Zero-Leverage Puzzle,"In this paper, I examine why some firms have zero leverage. I fail to find
evidence that firms are unlevered because of managerial entrenchment since
these firms do not have weaker corporate governance. I reject the hypothesis
that firms become zero-leverage after prolonged periods of high market
valuation, since before levering these firms do not suffer from declining
valuations and continue to issue large amounts of equity. I find strong
evidence in favor of the financial constraints explanation of the zero-leverage
puzzle. Zero-leverage firms appear to be financially constrained using three
different measures of financial constraints. I obtain mixed evidence on the
financial flexibility hypothesis since all-equity firms increase investments
and acquisitions after levering, but the probability of their levering
decreased during the financial crisis. My results suggest that financial
constraints are the first-order the driver of zero-leverage behavior and are
more important than less obvious explanations such as managerial entrenchment.",Mykola Pinchuk,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00761v1,False,True,False,False,False,730.0,Katharina A Lewellen,Boston,Completed,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/rof/rfw065,"Leverage (statistics), Equity (law), Zero (linguistics), Equity capital, Monetary economics, Developing country, Business, Capital structure, Conservatism, Economics, Econometrics, Finance, Economic growth, Political science, Computer science, Debt, Linguistics, Philosophy, Politics, Law, Initial public offering, Machine learning",University of South Carolina; University of Alberta,University of South Carolina; Nottingham University Business School (NUBS) China; University of Alberta,University of South Carolina; Nottingham University Business School (NUBS) China; University of Alberta
Only-child matching penalty in the marriage market,"This study explores the marriage matching of only-child individuals and its
outcome. Specifically, we analyze two aspects. First, we investigate how
marital status (i.e., marriage with an only child, that with a non-only child
and remaining single) differs between only children and non-only children. This
analysis allows us to know whether people choose mates in a positive or a
negative assortative manner regarding only-child status, and to predict whether
only-child individuals benefit from marriage matching premiums or are subject
to penalties regarding partner attractiveness. Second, we measure the
premium/penalty by the size of the gap in partner's socio economic status (SES,
here, years of schooling) between only-child and non--only-child individuals.
The conventional economic theory and the observed marriage patterns of positive
assortative mating on only-child status predict that only-child individuals are
subject to a matching penalty in the marriage market, especially when their
partner is also an only child. Furthermore, our estimation confirms that among
especially women marrying an only-child husband, only children are penalized in

properties play important roles in manufacturing, integration and performance
for their potential applications. Mechanics is indispensable in the study of
mechanical properties, both experimentally and theoretically. The coupling
between the mechanical and other physical properties (thermal, electronic,
optical) is also of great interest in exploring novel applications, where
mechanics has to be combined with condensed matter physics to establish a
scalable theoretical framework. Moreover, mechanical interactions between 2D
materials and various substrate materials are essential for integrated device
applications of 2D materials, for which the mechanics of interfaces (adhesion
and friction) has to be developed for the 2D materials. Here we review recent

"Effect of infill pattern and build orientation on mechanical properties
  of FDM printed parts: An experimental modal analysis approach","Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is one of the most widely explored additive
manufacturing method that uses thermoplastic materials to manufacture products.
Mechanical properties of parts manufactured using FDM are influenced by
different process parameters involved during manufacturing as they impact the
bonding among different layers of cross-section. In this study, the effect of
infill patterns and build orientations on the mechanical properties of PLA
based parts manufactured using FDM method is studied. Six different infill
patterns (triangles, cubic, concentric, tetrahedral, lines, and zigzag) and
three different orientations (flatwise, edgewise, and upright) are considered
for rectangular beam type parts. For determining mechanical properties of parts
with different infill patterns and orientations, flexural bending test is
performed. Experimental modal analysis of manufactured parts is performed to
observe the relation of natural frequencies with elastic modulus of the parts
obtained from flexural bending test. The possibility of experimental modal
analysis as an alternative non-destructive method for testing mechanical
properties of FDM 3D printed parts is explored.",Santosh Rajkumar,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05692v1,False,True,False,False,False,749.0,Christopher J Ordowich,Washington,Completed,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2202.05692,"Bending, Infill, Materials science, Zigzag, Flexural strength, Structural engineering, Fused deposition modeling, Composite material, Modal analysis, Modal, 3D printing, Finite element method, Engineering, Geometry, Mathematics",,,
"How does stock market reflect the change in economic demand? A study on
  the industry-specific volatility spillover networks of China's stock market
  during the outbreak of COVID-19","Using the carefully selected industry classification standard, we divide 102
industry securities indices in China's stock market into four demand-oriented
sector groups and identify demand-oriented industry-specific volatility
spillover networks. The ""deman-oriented"" is a new idea of reconstructing the
structure of the networks considering the relationship between industry sectors
and the economic demand their outputs meeting. Networks with the new structure
help us improve the understanding of the economic demand change, especially
when the macroeconomic is dramatically influenced by exogenous shocks like the
outbreak of COVID-19. At the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19, in China's
stock market, spillover effects from industry indices of sectors meeting the
investment demand to those meeting the consumption demands rose significantly.
However, these spillover effects fell after the outbreak containment in China
appeared to be effective. Besides, some services sectors including utility,
transportation and information services have played increasingly important
roles in the networks of industry-specific volatility spillovers as of the
COVID-19 out broke. By implication, firstly, being led by Chinese government,
the COVID-19 is successfully contained and the work resumption is organized
with a high efficiency in China. The risk of the investment demand therefore
was controlled and eliminated relatively fast. Secondly, the intensive using of
non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) led to supply restriction in services
in China. It will still be a potential threat for the Chinese economic recovery
in the next stage.",Fu Qiao; Yan Yan,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07487v1,False,True,False,False,False,751.0,Evan T Rawley,Baruch,Completed,2014.0,,"Spillover effect, Stock market, Volatility (finance), Stock (firearms), China, Demand shock, Business, Supply and demand, Economics, Industrial organization, Monetary economics, Finance, Macroeconomics, Mechanical engineering, Paleontology, Horse, Political science, Law, Engineering, Biology",,,
"Investigating Mode Effects in Interviewer Variances Using Two
  Representative Multi-mode Surveys","This study examines whether interviewer variances remain consistent across
different modes in mixed-mode studies, using data from two distinct designs. In
the first design, when interviewers are responsible for either face-to-face or
telephone mode, we examine whether there are mode differences in interviewer
variances for 1) sensitive political questions, 2) international items, 3) and
item missing indicators on international items, using the Arab Barometer wave 6
Jordan data. In the second design, we draw on Health and Retirement Study (HRS)
2016 core survey data to examine the question on three topics when interviewers
are responsible for both modes. The topics cover 1) the CESD depression scale,
2) interviewer observations, and 3) the physical activity scale. To account for
the lack of interpenetrated designs in both data sources, we include
respondent-level covariates in our models. We find significant differences in
interviewer variances on one item (twelve items in total) in the Arab Barometer
study; whereas for HRS, the results are three out of eighteen. Overall, we find
the magnitude of the interviewer variances larger in FTF than TEL on sensitive
items. We conduct simulations to understand the power to detect mode effects in
the typically modest interviewer sample sizes.",Wenshan Yu; Michael R. Elliott; Trivellore E.

Synthetic Area Weighting for Measuring Public Opinion in Small Areas,"The comparison of subnational areas is ubiquitous but survey samples of these
areas are often biased or prohibitively small. Researchers turn to methods such
as multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to improve the efficiency
of estimates by partially pooling data across areas via random effects.
However, the random effect approach can pool observations only through
area-level aggregates. We instead propose a weighting estimator, the synthetic
area estimator, which weights on variables measured only in the survey to
partially pool observations individually. The proposed method consists of
two-step weighting: first to adjust differences across areas and then to adjust
for differences between the sample and population. Unlike MRP, our estimator
can directly use the national weights that are often estimated from pollsters
using proprietary information. Our approach also clarifies the assumptions
needed for valid partial pooling, without imposing an outcome model. We apply
the proposed method to estimate the support for immigration policies at the
congressional district level in Florida. Our empirical results show that small
area estimation models with insufficient covariates can mask opinion
heterogeneities across districts.",Shiro Kuriwaki; Soichiro Yamauchi,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05829v1,False,True,False,False,False,755.0,Trivellore E Raghunathan,Michigan,Completed,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2105.05829,"Weighting, Public opinion, Computer science, Geography, Political science, Physics, Law, Acoustics, Politics",,,

"Impact of the Three-Child Policy and Delayed Retirement on the Transfer
  of Surplus Rural Labor under Xi Jinping's New Population Vision: A
  Re-examination of China's Lewis Turning Point","Chinese-style modernization involves the modernization of a large population,
requiring top-level design in terms of scale and structure. The population
perspective in Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics
for a New Era serves as the fundamental guide for population policies. The
three-child policy and delayed retirement will affect the supply of labor in
China and challenge the previous assessments of China's Lewis Turning Point.
This study examines the rural surplus labor transfer from 2013 to 2022 based on
urban and rural data. The results indicate that China's overall wage levels
have continuously increased, the urban-rural income gap has narrowed, and the
transfer of surplus rural labor has slowed. China has passed the first turning
point and entered a transitional phase. Factors such as the level of
agricultural mechanization, urbanization rate, and urban-rural income gap are
more significant in influencing the transfer of surplus labor than the normal
working-age population ratio. The delayed retirement policy has a more
immediate impact on the supply and transfer of rural surplus labor than the
three-child policy. Additionally, delayed retirement can offset the negative
impact of the reduced relative surplus labor supply caused by the three-child
policy, although the three-child policy could increase the future absolute
surplus labor supply.",Jun Dai; Guanqing Shi; Xiaoke Xie; Aitong Xie,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14914v2,False,True,False,False,False,774.0,Amy B Martin,Triangle,Completed,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2409.14914,"China, Economics, Turning point, Labour economics, Point (geometry), Population ageing, Population, Political science, Law, Sociology, Demography, Art, Geometry, Mathematics, Period (music), Aesthetics",,,

are less attached to employment and come from low-income population. The
correlation between non-attrition and employment is positive and statistically
significant, though small. Also, wage estimates are biased upwards. Observed

"Using Deep Learning and Google Street View to Estimate the Demographic
  Makeup of the US","The United States spends more than $1B each year on initiatives such as the
American Community Survey (ACS), a labor-intensive door-to-door study that
measures statistics relating to race, gender, education, occupation,
unemployment, and other demographic factors. Although a comprehensive source of
data, the lag between demographic changes and their appearance in the ACS can
exceed half a decade. As digital imagery becomes ubiquitous and machine vision
techniques improve, automated data analysis may provide a cheaper and faster
alternative. Here, we present a method that determines socioeconomic trends
from 50 million images of street scenes, gathered in 200 American cities by
Google Street View cars. Using deep learning-based computer vision techniques,
we determined the make, model, and year of all motor vehicles encountered in
particular neighborhoods. Data from this census of motor vehicles, which
enumerated 22M automobiles in total (8% of all automobiles in the US), was used
to accurately estimate income, race, education, and voting patterns, with
single-precinct resolution. (The average US precinct contains approximately
1000 people.) The resulting associations are surprisingly simple and powerful.
For instance, if the number of sedans encountered during a 15-minute drive
through a city is higher than the number of pickup trucks, the city is likely
to vote for a Democrat during the next Presidential election (88% chance);
otherwise, it is likely to vote Republican (82%). Our results suggest that
automated systems for monitoring demographic trends may effectively complement
labor-intensive approaches, with the potential to detect trends with fine
spatial resolution, in close to real time.",Timnit Gebru; Jonathan Krause; Yilun Wang; Duyun Chen; Jia Deng; Erez Lieberman Aiden; Li Fei-Fei,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06683v2,False,True,False,False,True,776.0,Philippe .

Fine-Grained Car Detection for Visual Census Estimation,"Targeted socioeconomic policies require an accurate understanding of a
country's demographic makeup. To that end, the United States spends more than 1
billion dollars a year gathering census data such as race, gender, education,
occupation and unemployment rates. Compared to the traditional method of
collecting surveys across many years which is costly and labor intensive,
data-driven, machine learning driven approaches are cheaper and faster--with
the potential ability to detect trends in close to real time. In this work, we
leverage the ubiquity of Google Street View images and develop a computer
vision pipeline to predict income, per capita carbon emission, crime rates and
other city attributes from a single source of publicly available visual data.
We first detect cars in 50 million images across 200 of the largest US cities
and train a model to predict demographic attributes using the detected cars. To
facilitate our work, we have collected the largest and most challenging
fine-grained dataset reported to date consisting of over 2600 classes of cars
comprised of images from Google Street View and other web sources, classified
by car experts to account for even the most subtle of visual differences. We
use this data to construct the largest scale fine-grained detection system

Endogenous Labour Flow Networks,"In the last decade, the study of labour dynamics has led to the introduction
of labour flow networks (LFNs) as a way to conceptualise job-to-job
transitions, and to the development of mathematical models to explore the
dynamics of these networked flows. To date, LFN models have relied upon an
assumption of static network structure. However, as recent events (increasing
automation in the workplace, the COVID-19 pandemic, a surge in the demand for
programming skills, etc.) have shown, we are experiencing drastic shifts to the
job landscape that are altering the ways individuals navigate the labour
market. Here we develop a novel model that emerges LFNs from agent-level
behaviour, removing the necessity of assuming that future job-to-job flows will
be along the same paths where they have been historically observed. This model,
informed by microdata for the United Kingdom, generates empirical LFNs with a
high level of accuracy. We use the model to explore how shocks impacting the
underlying distributions of jobs and wages alter the topology of the LFN. This
framework represents a crucial step towards the development of models that can

"Local Labor Market Effects of Mergers and Acquisitions in Developing
  Countries: Evidence from Brazil","I use matched employer-employee records merged with corporate tax information
from 2003 to 2017 to estimate labor market-wide effects of mergers and
acquisitions in Brazil. Labor markets are defined by pairs of commuting zone
and industry sector. In the following year of a merger, market size falls by
10.8%. The employment adjustment is concentrated in merging firms. For the
firms not involved in M&As, I estimate a 1.07% decline in workers earnings and
a positive, although not significant, increase in their size. Most mergers have
a predicted impact of zero points in concentration, measured by the
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). I spillover firms, earnings decline similarly
for mergers with high and low predicted changes in HHI. Contrary to the recent

Hedonic Prices and Quality Adjusted Price Indices Powered by AI,"Accurate, real-time measurements of price index changes using electronic
records are essential for tracking inflation and productivity in today's
economic environment. We develop empirical hedonic models that can process
large amounts of unstructured product data (text, images, prices, quantities)
and output accurate hedonic price estimates and derived indices. To accomplish
this, we generate abstract product attributes, or ``features,'' from text
descriptions and images using deep neural networks, and then use these
attributes to estimate the hedonic price function. Specifically, we convert
textual information about the product to numeric features using large language
models based on transformers, trained or fine-tuned using product descriptions,
and convert the product image to numeric features using a residual network
model. To produce the estimated hedonic price function, we again use a
multi-task neural network trained to predict a product's price in all time
periods simultaneously. To demonstrate the performance of this approach, we
apply the models to Amazon's data for first-party apparel sales and estimate
hedonic prices. The resulting models have high predictive accuracy, with $R^2$
ranging from $80\%$ to $90\%$. Finally, we construct the AI-based hedonic
Fisher price index, chained at the year-over-year frequency. We contrast the

Cluster detection and risk estimation for spatio-temporal health data,"In epidemiological disease mapping one aims to estimate the spatio-temporal
pattern in disease risk and identify high-risk clusters, allowing health
interventions to be appropriately targeted. Bayesian spatio-temporal models are
used to estimate smoothed risk surfaces, but this is contrary to the aim of
identifying groups of areal units that exhibit elevated risks compared with
their neighbours. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new Bayesian
hierarchical modelling approach for simultaneously estimating disease risk and
identifying high-risk clusters in space and time. Inference for this model is
based on Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, using the freely available R
package CARBayesST that has been developed in conjunction with this paper. Our

"On two non-existence results for Cameron-Liebler $k$-sets in
  $\mathrm{PG}(n,q)$","This paper focuses on non-existence results for Cameron-Liebler $k$-sets. A
Cameron-Liebler $k$-set is a collection of $k$-spaces in $\mathrm{PG}(n,q)$ or
$\mathrm{AG}(n,q)$ admitting a certain parameter $x$, which is dependent on the
size of this collection. One of the main research questions remains the
(non-)existence of Cameron-Liebler $k$-sets with parameter $x$. This paper
improves two non-existence results. First we show that the parameter of a
non-trivial Cameron-Liebler $k$-set in $\mathrm{PG}(n,q)$ should be larger than
$q^{n-\frac{5k}{2}-1}$, which is an improvement of an earlier known lower
bound. Secondly, we prove a modular equality on the parameter $x$ of
Cameron-Liebler $k$-sets in $\mathrm{PG}(n,q)$ with
$x<\frac{q^{n-k}-1}{q^{k+1}-1}$, $n\geq 2k+1$, $n-k+1\geq 7$ and $n-k$ even. In
the affine case we show a similar result for $n-k+1\geq 3$ and $n-k$ even. This

Large-Scale Analysis of New Employee Network Dynamics,"The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digital transformations across
industries, but also introduced new challenges into workplaces, including the
difficulties of effectively socializing with colleagues when working remotely.
This challenge is exacerbated for new employees who need to develop workplace
networks from the outset. In this paper, by analyzing a large-scale telemetry
dataset of more than 10,000 Microsoft employees who joined the company in the
first three months of 2022, we describe how new employees interact and
telecommute with their colleagues during their ``onboarding'' period. Our
results reveal that although new hires are gradually expanding networks over
time, there still exists significant gaps between their network statistics and
those of tenured employees even after the six-month onboarding phase. We also
observe that heterogeneity exists among new employees in how their networks
change over time, where employees whose job tasks do not necessarily require
extensive and diverse connections could be at a disadvantaged position in this
onboarding process. By investigating how web-based people recommendations in
organizational knowledge base facilitate new employees naturally expand their
networks, we also demonstrate the potential of web-based applications for
addressing the aforementioned socialization challenges. Altogether, our
findings provide insights on new employee network dynamics in remote and hybrid

Personalized Subsidy Rules,"Subsidies are commonly used to encourage behaviors that can lead to short- or
long-term benefits. Typical examples include subsidized job training programs
and provisions of preventive health products, in which both behavioral
responses and associated gains can exhibit heterogeneity. This study uses the
marginal treatment effect (MTE) framework to study personalized assignments of
subsidies based on individual characteristics. First, we derive the optimality
condition for a welfare-maximizing subsidy rule by showing that the welfare can
be represented as a function of the MTE. Next, we show that subsidies generally
result in better welfare than directly mandating the encouraged behavior
because subsidy rules implicitly target individuals through unobserved
heterogeneity in the behavioral response. When there is positive selection,
that is, when individuals with higher returns are more likely to select the
encouraged behavior, the optimal subsidy rule achieves the first-best welfare,
which is the optimal welfare if a policy-maker can observe individuals' private
information. We then provide methods to (partially) identify the optimal
subsidy rule when the MTE is identified and unidentified. Particularly,
positive selection allows for the point identification of the optimal subsidy
rule even when the MTE curve is not. As an empirical application, we study the
optimal wage subsidy using the experimental data from the Jordan New
Opportunities for Women pilot study.",Yu-Chang Chen; Haitian Xie,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13545v2,False,True,False,False,False,800.0,Isaac N McFarlin,Michigan,Completed,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2202.13545,"Subsidy, Welfare, Economics, Selection (genetic algorithm), Wage, Point (geometry), Identification (biology), Deadweight loss, Public economics, Microeconomics, Computer science, Labour economics, Mathematics, Machine learning, Botany, Geometry, Market economy, Biology",,,

"Accounting for survey design in Bayesian disaggregation of survey-based
  areal estimates of proportions: an application to the American Community
  Survey","Understanding the effects of social determinants of health on health outcomes
requires data on characteristics of the neighborhoods in which subjects live.
However, estimates of these characteristics are often aggregated over space and
time in a fashion that diminishes their utility. Take, for example, estimates
from the American Community Survey (ACS), a multi-year nationwide survey
administered by the U.S. Census Bureau: estimates for small municipal areas are
aggregated over 5-year periods, whereas 1-year estimates are only available for
municipal areas with populations $>$65,000. Researchers may wish to use ACS
estimates in studies of population health to characterize neighborhood-level
exposures. However, 5-year estimates may not properly characterize temporal
changes or align temporally with other data in the study, while the coarse
spatial resolution of the 1-year estimates diminishes their utility in
characterizing neighborhood exposure. To circumvent this issue, in this paper
we propose a modeling framework to disaggregate estimates of proportions
derived from sampling surveys which explicitly accounts for the survey design
effect. We illustrate the utility of our model by applying it to the ACS data,

practice, this works well for a wide range of tabulations. Nevertheless, in
situations that exhibit heterogeneity among geographies and/or sparsity in the
data, the Gaussian assumptions may be problematic and lead to underperformance.
To remedy these situations, we propose a multivariate hierarchical Bayesian

"Capitalizing on a Crisis: A Computational Analysis of all Five Million
  British Firms During the Covid-19 Pandemic","The Covid-19 pandemic brought unprecedented changes to business ownership in
the UK which affects a generation of entrepreneurs and their employees.
Nonetheless, the impact remains poorly understood. This is because research on
capital accumulation has typically lacked high-quality, individualized,
population-level data. We overcome these barriers to examine who benefits from
economic crises through a computationally orientated lens of firm creation.
Leveraging a comprehensive cache of administrative data on every UK firm and
all nine million people running them, combined with probabilistic algorithms,
we conduct individual-level analyses to understand who became Covid
entrepreneurs. Using these techniques, we explore characteristics of
entrepreneurs--such as age, gender, region, business experience, and
industry--which potentially predict Covid entrepreneurship. By employing an
automated time series model selection procedure to generate counterfactuals, we
show that Covid entrepreneurs were typically aged 35-49 (40.4%), men (73.1%),
and had previously held roles in existing firms (59.4%). For most industries,
growth was disproportionately concentrated around London. It was therefore
existing corporate elites who were most able to capitalize on the Covid crisis
and not, as some hypothesized, young entrepreneurs who were setting up their
first businesses. In this respect, the pandemic will likely impact future
wealth inequalities. Our work offers methodological guidance for future
policymakers during economic crises and highlights the long-term consequences

Structure-Preserving 3D Garment Modeling with Neural Sewing Machines,"3D Garment modeling is a critical and challenging topic in the area of
computer vision and graphics, with increasing attention focused on garment
representation learning, garment reconstruction, and controllable garment
manipulation, whereas existing methods were constrained to model garments under
specific categories or with relatively simple topologies. In this paper, we
propose a novel Neural Sewing Machine (NSM), a learning-based framework for
structure-preserving 3D garment modeling, which is capable of learning
representations for garments with diverse shapes and topologies and is
successfully applied to 3D garment reconstruction and controllable
manipulation. To model generic garments, we first obtain sewing pattern
embedding via a unified sewing pattern encoding module, as the sewing pattern
can accurately describe the intrinsic structure and the topology of the 3D
garment. Then we use a 3D garment decoder to decode the sewing pattern
embedding into a 3D garment using the UV-position maps with masks. To preserve
the intrinsic structure of the predicted 3D garment, we introduce an
inner-panel structure-preserving loss, an inter-panel structure-preserving
loss, and a surface-normal loss in the learning process of our framework. We
evaluate NSM on the public 3D garment dataset with sewing patterns with diverse
garment shapes and categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed NSM is capable of representing 3D garments under diverse garment
shapes and topologies, realistically reconstructing 3D garments from 2D images
with the preserved structure, and accurately manipulating the 3D garment
categories, shapes, and topologies, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods

"FloodGenome: Interpretable Machine Learning for Decoding Features
  Shaping Property Flood Risk Predisposition in Cities","Understanding the fundamental characteristics that shape the inherent flood
risk disposition of urban areas is critical for integrated urban design
strategies for flood risk reduction. Flood risk disposition specifies an
inherent and event-independent magnitude of property flood risk and measures
the extent to which urban areas are susceptible to property damage if exposed
to a weather hazard. This study presents FloodGenome as an interpretable
machine learning model for evaluation of the extent to which various
hydrological, topographic, and built-environment features and their
interactions shape flood risk disposition in urban areas. Using flood damage
claims data from the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program covering the period
2003 through 2023 across four metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), the
analysis computes building damage ratios and flood claim counts by employing
k-means clustering for classifying census block groups (CBGs) into distinct
property flood risk disposition levels. Then a random forest model is created
to specify property flood risk levels of CBGs based on various intertwined
hydrological, topographic, and built-environment features. The model
transferability analysis results show consistent performance across MSAs,
revealing the universality of underlying features that shape city property
flood risks. The FloodGenome model is then used to:(1) evaluate the extent to
which future urban development would exacerbate flood risk disposition of urban
areas; and (2) specify property flood risk levels at finer spatial resolution
providing critical insights for flood risk management processes. The
FloodGenome model and the findings provide novel tools and insights for

"Collision of Environmental Injustice and Sea Level Rise: Assessment of
  Risk Inequality in Flood-induced Pollutant Dispersion from Toxic Sites in
  Texas","Global sea-level rise causes increasing threats of coastal flood and
subsequent pollutant dispersion. However, there are still few studies on the
disparity arising from such threats and the extent to which different
communities could be exposed to flood-induced pollution dispersion from toxic
sites under future sea level rise. To address this gap, this study selects
Texas (a U.S. state with a large number of toxic sites and significant flood
hazards) as the study area and investigates impacts of flood-induced pollutant
dispersion on different communities under current (2018) and future (2050)
flood hazard scenarios.The results show, currently, north coastline in Texas
bears higher threats and vulnerable communities (i.e., low income, minorities
and unemployed) are disproportionally exposed to these threats. In addition,
the future sea-level rise and the exacerbated flood hazards will put additional
threats on more (about 10%) Texas residents, among which vulnerable communities
will still be disproportionately exposed to the increased threats. Our study
reveals the facts that potential coastal pollutant dispersion will further
aggravate the environmental injustice issues at the intersection of toxic sites
and flood hazards for vulnerable populations and exacerbate risk inequalities.

"Effect of State and Local Sexual Orientation Anti-Discrimination Laws on
  Labor Market Differentials","This paper presents the first quasi-experimental research examining the
effect of both local and state anti-discrimination laws on sexual orientation
on the labor supply and wages of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) workers. To
do so, we use the American Community Survey data on household composition to
infer sexual orientation and combine this with a unique panel dataset on local
anti-discrimination laws. Using variation in law implementation across
localities over time and between same-sex and different-sex couples, we find
that anti-discrimination laws significantly reduce gaps in labor force
participation rate, employment, and the wage gap for gay men relative to
straight men. These laws also significantly reduce the labor force
participation rate, employment, and wage premium for lesbian women relative to
straight women. One explanation for the reduced labor supply and wage premium
is that lesbian couples begin to have more children in response to the laws.
Finally, we present evidence that state anti-discrimination laws significantly
and persistently increased support for same-sex marriage. This research shows
that anti-discrimination laws can be an effective policy tool for reducing
labor market inequalities across sexual orientation and improving sentiment
toward LGB Americans.",Scott Delhommer; Domonkos F.

Open Collaboration for Innovation: Principles and Performance,"The principles of open collaboration for innovation (and production), once
distinctive to open source software, are now found in many other ventures. Some
of these ventures are internet-based: Wikipedia, online forums and communities.
Others are off-line: in medicine, science, and everyday life. Such ventures
have been affecting traditional firms, and may represent a new organizational
form. Despite the impact of such ventures, questions remain about their
operating principles and performance. Here we define open collaboration (OC),
the underlying set of principles, and propose that it is a robust engine for
innovation and production. First, we review multiple OC ventures and identify
four defining principles. In all instances, participants create goods and
services of economic value, they exchange and reuse each other's work, they
labor purposefully with just loose coordination, and they permit anyone to
contribute and consume. These principles distinguish OC from other
organizational forms, such as firms or cooperatives. Next, we turn to
performance. To understand the performance of OC, we develop a computational
model, combining innovation theory with recent evidence on human cooperation.
We identify and investigate three elements that affect performance: the
cooperativeness of participants, the diversity of their needs, and the degree
to which the goods are rival (subtractable). Through computational experiments,
we find that OC performs well even in seemingly harsh environments: when
cooperators are a minority, free riders are present, diversity is lacking, or
goods are rival. We conclude that OC is viable and likely to expand into new
domains. The findings also inform the discussion on new organizational forms,
collaborative and communal.",Sheen Levine; Michael Prietula,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7541v1,False,True,False,False,False,834.0,Yue M Zhou,Michigan,Completed,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2013.0872,"Cooperativeness, Open innovation, Knowledge management, Business, Value (mathematics), Diversity (politics), Goods and services, Set (abstract data type), Industrial organization, New Ventures, Marketing, Reuse, Production (economics), Absorptive capacity, Cannibalization, Resource (disambiguation), Economics, Computer science, Microeconomics, Entrepreneurship, Sociology, Anthropology, Ecology, Temperament, Biology, Psychology, Social psychology, Machine learning, Market economy, Programming language, Personality, Finance, Computer network",Columbia University; Emory University,"Columbia University, New York, New York 10027; Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322","Columbia University, New York, New York 10027; Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322"
"The Link Between Health Insurance Coverage and Citizenship Among
  Immigrants: Bayesian Unit-Level Regression Modeling of Categorical Survey
  Data Observed with Measurement Error","Social scientists are interested in studying the impact that citizenship
status has on health insurance coverage among immigrants in the United States.
This can be done using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation
(SIPP); however, two primary challenges emerge. First, statistical models must
account for the survey design in some fashion to reduce the risk of bias due to
informative sampling. Second, it has been observed that survey respondents
misreport citizenship status at nontrivial rates. This too can induce bias
within a statistical model. Thus, we propose the use of a weighted
pseudo-likelihood mixture of categorical distributions, where the mixture
component is determined by the latent true response variable, in order to model
the misreported data. We illustrate through an empirical simulation study that
this approach can mitigate the two sources of bias attributable to the sample
design and misreporting. Importantly, our misreporting model can be further
used as a component in a deeper hierarchical model. With this in mind, we
conduct an analysis of the relationship between health insurance coverage and
citizenship status using data from the SIPP.",Paul A. Parker; Scott H. Holan; James D.

"WCLD: Curated Large Dataset of Criminal Cases from Wisconsin Circuit
  Courts","Machine learning based decision-support tools in criminal justice systems are
subjects of intense discussions and academic research. There are important open
questions about the utility and fairness of such tools. Academic researchers
often rely on a few small datasets that are not sufficient to empirically study
various real-world aspects of these questions. In this paper, we contribute
WCLD, a curated large dataset of 1.5 million criminal cases from circuit courts
in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. We used reliable public data from 1970 to 2020
to curate attributes like prior criminal counts and recidivism outcomes. The
dataset contains large number of samples from five racial groups, in addition
to information like sex and age (at judgment and first offense). Other
attributes in this dataset include neighborhood characteristics obtained from
census data, detailed types of offense, charge severity, case decisions,
sentence lengths, year of filing etc. We also provide pseudo-identifiers for
judge, county and zipcode. The dataset will not only enable researchers to more
rigorously study algorithmic fairness in the context of criminal justice, but
also relate algorithmic challenges with various systemic issues. We also

"Colocation of skill related suppliers -- Revisiting coagglomeration
  using firm-to-firm network data","Strong local clusters help firms compete on global markets. One explanation
for this is that firms benefit from locating close to their suppliers and
customers. However, the emergence of global supply chains shows that physical
proximity is not necessarily a prerequisite to successfully manage
customer-supplier relations anymore. This raises the question when firms need
to colocate in value chains and when they can coordinate over longer distances.
We hypothesize that one important aspect is the extent to which supply chain
partners exchange not just goods but also know-how. To test this, we build on
an expanding literature that studies the drivers of industrial coagglomeration
to analyze when supply chain connections lead firms to colocation. We exploit
detailed micro-data for the Hungarian economy between 2015 and 2017, linking
firm registries, employer-employee matched data and firm-to-firm transaction
data from value-added tax records. This allows us to observe colocation, labor
flows and value chain connections at the level of firms, as well as construct
aggregated coagglomeration patterns, skill relatedness and input-output
connections between pairs of industries. We show that supply chains are more
likely to support coagglomeration when the industries involved are also skill
related. That is, input-output and labor market channels reinforce each other,
but supplier connections only matter for colocation when industries have
similar labor requirements, suggesting that they employ similar types of
know-how. We corroborate this finding by analyzing the interactions between
firms, showing that supplier relations are more geographically constrained
between companies that operate in skill related industries.",Sándor Juhász; Zoltán Elekes; Virág Ilyés; Frank Neffke,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07071v1,False,True,False,False,False,859.0,Pinar Celikkol Geylani,Penn State,Completed,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2405.07071,"Business, Industrial organization, Knowledge management, Computer science, Marketing",,,
"Financing Costs, Per-Shipment Costs and Shipping Frequency: Firm-Level
  Evidence from Bangladesh","In international trade, firms face lengthy ordering-producing-delivery times
and make shipping frequency decisions based on the per-shipment costs and
financing costs. In this paper, I develop a model of importer-exporter
procurement where the importer procures international inputs from exporting
firms in developing countries. The exporters are credit constrained for working
capital, incur the per-shipment fixed costs, and get paid after goods are
delivered to the importer. The model shows that the shipping frequency
increases for high financing costs in origin and destination. Furthermore,
longer delivery times increase shipping frequency as well as procurement costs.
The model also shows that the higher per-shipment fixed costs reduce the
shipping frequency, in line with previous literature. Reduced transaction costs
lower the exporter's demand for financial services through shipping frequency
adjustment, mitigating the financial frictions of the firm. Then, I empirically
investigate whether the conclusions regarding the effect of per-shipment fixed
costs on shipping frequency from the theoretical model and in the existing
literature extend to developing countries. My estimation method addresses
several biases. First, I deal with aggregation bias with the firm, product, and
country-level analysis. Second, I consider the Poisson Pseudo Maximum
Likelihood (PPML) estimation method to deal with heteroscedasticity bias from
the OLS estimation of log-linear models. Third, I fix the distance
non-linearity of Bangladeshi exports. Finally, I consider the effect of
financing cost on shipping frequency to address omitted variable bias. Using
transaction-level export data from Bangladesh, I find that 10% higher
per-shipment costs reduce the shipping frequency by 3.45%. The findings are
robust to different specifications and subsamples.",Md Deluair Hossen,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04223v1,False,True,False,False,False,860.0,Jonathan I Dingel,Chicago,Completed,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2303.04223,"Business, Fixed cost, Transaction cost, Variable cost, Procurement, Estimation, Product (mathematics), Probit, Developing country, Finance, Industrial organization, Economics, Monetary economics, Econometrics, Microeconomics, Marketing, Geometry, Mathematics, Management, Economic growth",,,
Fertility and its Meaning: Evidence from Search Behavior,"Fertility choices are linked to the different preferences and constraints of
individuals and couples, and vary importantly by socio-economic status, as well
by cultural and institutional context. The meaning of childbearing and
child-rearing, therefore, differs between individuals and across groups. In
this paper, we combine data from Google Correlate and Google Trends for the
U.S. with ground truth data from the American Community Survey to derive new
insights into fertility and its meaning. First, we show that Google Correlate
can be used to illustrate socio-economic differences on the circumstances
around pregnancy and birth: e.g., searches for ""flying while pregnant"" are
linked to high income fertility, and ""paternity test"" are linked to non-marital
fertility. Second, we combine several search queries to build predictive models
of regional variation in fertility, explaining about 75% of the variance.

"High Accurate and Explainable Multi-Pill Detection Framework with Graph
  Neural Network-Assisted Multimodal Data Fusion","Due to the significant resemblance in visual appearance, pill misuse is
prevalent and has become a critical issue, responsible for one-third of all
deaths worldwide. Pill identification, thus, is a crucial concern needed to be
investigated thoroughly. Recently, several attempts have been made to exploit
deep learning to tackle the pill identification problem. However, most
published works consider only single-pill identification and fail to
distinguish hard samples with identical appearances. Also, most existing pill
image datasets only feature single pill images captured in carefully controlled
environments under ideal lighting conditions and clean backgrounds. In this
work, we are the first to tackle the multi-pill detection problem in real-world
settings, aiming at localizing and identifying pills captured by users in a
pill intake. Moreover, we also introduce a multi-pill image dataset taken in
unconstrained conditions. To handle hard samples, we propose a novel method for
constructing heterogeneous a priori graphs incorporating three forms of
inter-pill relationships, including co-occurrence likelihood, relative size,
and visual semantic correlation. We then offer a framework for integrating a
priori with pills' visual features to enhance detection accuracy. Our
experimental results have proved the robustness, reliability, and
explainability of the proposed framework. Experimentally, it outperforms all
detection benchmarks in terms of all evaluation metrics. Specifically, our
proposed framework improves COCO mAP metrics by 9.4% over Faster R-CNN and
12.0% compared to vanilla YOLOv5. Our study opens up new opportunities for
protecting patients from medication errors using an AI-based pill

"Image-based Contextual Pill Recognition with Medical Knowledge Graph
  Assistance","Identifying pills given their captured images under various conditions and
backgrounds has been becoming more and more essential. Several efforts have
been devoted to utilizing the deep learning-based approach to tackle the pill
recognition problem in the literature. However, due to the high similarity
between pills' appearance, misrecognition often occurs, leaving pill
recognition a challenge. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a novel
approach named PIKA that leverages external knowledge to enhance pill
recognition accuracy. Specifically, we address a practical scenario (which we
call contextual pill recognition), aiming to identify pills in a picture of a
patient's pill intake. Firstly, we propose a novel method for modeling the
implicit association between pills in the presence of an external data source,
in this case, prescriptions. Secondly, we present a walk-based graph embedding
model that transforms from the graph space to vector space and extracts
condensed relational features of the pills. Thirdly, a final framework is
provided that leverages both image-based visual and graph-based relational
features to accomplish the pill identification task. Within this framework, the
visual representation of each pill is mapped to the graph embedding space,
which is then used to execute attention over the graph representation,
resulting in a semantically-rich context vector that aids in the final
classification. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use external
prescription data to establish associations between medicines and to classify
them using this aiding information. The architecture of PIKA is lightweight and
has the flexibility to incorporate into any recognition backbones. The
experimental results show that by leveraging the external knowledge graph, PIKA
can improve the recognition accuracy from 4.8% to 34.1% in terms of F1-score,
compared to baselines.",Anh Duy Nguyen; Thuy Dung Nguyen; Huy Hieu Pham; Thanh Hung Nguyen; Phi Le Nguyen,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02432v2,False,True,False,False,False,869.0,Emily G Collins,Michigan,Completed,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-8234-7_28,"Computer science, Pill, Graph, Artificial intelligence, Embedding, Feature learning, Machine learning, Theoretical computer science, Medicine, Pharmacology",Hanoi University of Science and Technology; VinUniversity,"Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam; College of Engineering and Computer Science, VinUniversity, Hanoi, Vietnam","Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam; College of Engineering and Computer Science, VinUniversity, Hanoi, Vietnam"
Synthetic Census Data Generation via Multidimensional Multiset Sum,"The US Decennial Census provides valuable data for both research and policy
purposes. Census data are subject to a variety of disclosure avoidance
techniques prior to release in order to preserve respondent confidentiality.
While many are interested in studying the impacts of disclosure avoidance
methods on downstream analyses, particularly with the introduction of
differential privacy in the 2020 Decennial Census, these efforts are limited by
a critical lack of data: The underlying ""microdata,"" which serve as necessary
input to disclosure avoidance methods, are kept confidential.
  In this work, we aim to address this limitation by providing tools to
generate synthetic microdata solely from published Census statistics, which can
then be used as input to any number of disclosure avoidance algorithms for the
sake of evaluation and carrying out comparisons. We define a principled
distribution over microdata given published Census statistics and design
algorithms to sample from this distribution. We formulate synthetic data
generation in this context as a knapsack-style combinatorial optimization
problem and develop novel algorithms for this setting. While the problem we
study is provably hard, we show empirically that our methods work well in
practice, and we offer theoretical arguments to explain our performance.
Finally, we verify that the data we produce are ""close"" to the desired ground
truth.",Cynthia Dwork; Kristjan Greenewald; Manish Raghavan,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10095v1,False,True,True,False,True,874.0,Nicholas Nagle,Atlanta,Completed,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2404.10095,"Multiset, Census, Geography, Computer science, Mathematics, Data mining, Combinatorics, Demography, Sociology, Population",,,
"The 2010 Census Confidentiality Protections Failed, Here's How and Why","Using only 34 published tables, we reconstruct five variables (census block,
sex, age, race, and ethnicity) in the confidential 2010 Census person records.
Using the 38-bin age variable tabulated at the census block level, at most
20.1% of reconstructed records can differ from their confidential source on
even a single value for these five variables. Using only published data, an
attacker can verify that all records in 70% of all census blocks (97 million
people) are perfectly reconstructed. The tabular publications in Summary File 1
thus have prohibited disclosure risk similar to the unreleased confidential
microdata. Reidentification studies confirm that an attacker can, within blocks
with perfect reconstruction accuracy, correctly infer the actual census
response on race and ethnicity for 3.4 million vulnerable population uniques
(persons with nonmodal characteristics) with 95% accuracy, the same precision
as the confidential data achieve and far greater than statistical baselines.
The flaw in the 2010 Census framework was the assumption that aggregation
prevented accurate microdata reconstruction, justifying weaker disclosure
limitation methods than were applied to 2010 Census public microdata. The
framework used for 2020 Census publications defends against attacks that are
based on reconstruction, as we also demonstrate here. Finally, we show that
alternatives to the 2020 Census Disclosure Avoidance System with similar
accuracy (enhanced swapping) also fail to protect confidentiality, and those
that partially defend against reconstruction attacks (incomplete suppression
implementations) destroy the primary statutory use case: data for redistricting

"An Approximate Monte Carlo Simulation Method for Estimating Uncertainty
  and Constructing Confidence Intervals for 2020 Census Statistics","To protect the confidentiality of the 2020 Census, the U.S. Census Bureau
adopted a statistical disclosure limitation framework based on the principles
of differential privacy. A key component was the TopDown Algorithm, which
applied differentially-private noise to an extensive series of counts from the
confidential 2020 Census data and transformed the resulting noisy measurements
into privacy-protected microdata which were then tabulated to produce official
data products. Though the codebase is publicly available, currently there is no
way to estimate the uncertainty for statistics included in the published data
products that accounts for both the noisy measurements and the post-processing
performed within the TopDown Algorithm. We propose an approximate Monte Carlo
Simulation method that allows for the estimation of statistical quantities like
mean squared error, bias, and variance, as well as the construction of
confidence intervals. The method uses the output of the production iteration of
the TopDown Algorithm as the input to additional iterations, allowing for
statistical quantities to be estimated without impacting the formal privacy
protections of the 2020 Census. The results show that, in general, the
quantities estimated by this approximate method closely match their intended
targets and that the resulting confidence intervals are statistically valid.",Robert Ashmead; Michael B.

augment survey data with auxiliary information on a local level. Here, we
propose an alternative microdata dissemination strategy that leverages the
utility of the original microdata with additional privacy safeguards through
synthetically generated data using generative models. We back our proposal with

"When the System does not Fit: Coping Strategies of Employment
  Consultants","Case and knowledge management systems are spread at the frontline across
public agencies. However, such systems are dedicated for the collaboration
within the agency rather than for the face-to-face interaction with the
clients. If used as a collaborative resource at the frontline, case and
knowledge management systems might disturb the service provision by displaying
unfiltered internal information, disclosing private data of other clients, or
revealing the limits of frontline employees' competence (if they cannot explain
something) or their authority (if they cannot override something). Observation
in the German Public Employment Agency shows that employment consultants make
use of various coping strategies during face-to-face consultations to extend
existing boundaries set by the case and knowledge management systems and by the
rules considering their usage. The analysis of these coping strategies unveils
the forces that shape the conduct of employment consultants during their
contacts with clients: the consultants' own understanding of work, the actual
and the perceived needs of the clients, and the political mission as well as
the internal rules of the employment agency. The findings form a twofold
contribution: First, they contribute to the discourse on work in employment
agencies by illustrating how the complexities of social welfare apparatus
demonstrate themselves in singular behavioural patterns. Second, they
contribute to the discourse on screen-level bureaucracy by depicting the
consultants as active and conscious mediators rather than passive interfaces

"A multiplicative masking method for preserving the skewness of the
  original micro-records","Masking methods for the safe dissemination of microdata consist of distorting
the original data while preserving a pre-defined set of statistical properties
in the microdata. For continuous variables, available methodologies rely
essentially on matrix masking and in particular on adding noise to the original
values, using more or less refined procedures depending on the extent of
information that one seeks to preserve. Almost all of these methods make use of
the critical assumption that the original datasets follow a normal distribution
and/or that the noise has such a distribution. This assumption is, however,
restrictive in the sense that few variables follow empirically a Gaussian
pattern: the distribution of household income, for example, is positively

"COVID-19's Unequal Toll: An assessment of small business impact
  disparities with respect to ethnorace in metropolitan areas in the US using
  mobility data","Early in the pandemic, counties and states implemented a variety of
non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) focused on mobility, such as national
lockdowns or work-from-home strategies, as it became clear that restricting
movement was essential to containing the epidemic. Due to these restrictions,
businesses were severely affected and in particular, small, urban restaurant
businesses. In addition to that, COVID-19 has also amplified many of the
socioeconomic disparities and systemic racial inequities that exist in our
society. The overarching objective of this study was to examine the changes in
small urban restaurant visitation patterns following the COVID-19 pandemic and
associated mobility restrictions, as well as to uncover potential disparities
across different racial/ethnic groups in order to understand inequities in the
impact and recovery. Specifically, the two key objectives were: 1) to analyze
the overall changes in restaurant visitation patterns in US metropolitan areas
during the pandemic compared to a pre-pandemic baseline, and 2) to investigate
differences in visitation pattern changes across Census Block Groups with
majority Asian, Black, Hispanic, White, and American Indian populations,
identifying any disproportionate effects. Using aggregated geolocated cell
phone data from SafeGraph, we document the overall changes in small urban
restaurant businesses' visitation patterns with respect to racial composition
at a granularity of Census Block Groups. Our results show clear indications of
reduced visitation patterns after the pandemic, with slow recoveries. Via
visualizations and statistical analyses, we show that reductions in visitation
patterns were the highest for small urban restaurant businesses in majority
Asian neighborhoods.",Saad Mohammad Abrar; Kazi Tasnim Zinat; Naman Awasthi; Vanessa Frias-Martinez,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11121v1,False,True,False,False,False,893.0,Marc Rubin,Washington,Completed,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2405.11121,"Metropolitan area, Toll, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, Regional science, Geography, Business, Economic geography, Economic growth, Political science, Economics, Medicine, Virology, Outbreak, Disease, Archaeology, Pathology, Infectious disease (medical specialty), Immunology",,,
"Early life exposure to measles and later-life outcomes: Evidence from
  the introduction of a vaccine","Until the mid 1960s, the UK experienced regular measles epidemics, with the
vast majority of children being infected in early childhood. The introduction
of a measles vaccine substantially reduced its incidence. The first part of
this paper examines the long-term human capital and health effects of this
change in the early childhood disease environment. The second part investigates
interactions between the vaccination campaign and individuals' endowments as
captured using molecular genetic data, shedding light on complementarities
between public health investments and individual endowments. We use two
identification approaches, based on the nationwide introduction of the vaccine
in 1968 and local vaccination trials in 1966. Our results show that exposure to
the vaccination in early childhood positively affects adult height, but only
among those with high genetic endowments for height. We find no effects on
years of education; neither a direct effect, nor evidence of complementarities.",Gerard J. van den Berg; Stephanie von Hinke; Nicolai Vitt,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10558v1,False,True,False,False,False,898.0,Jason Fletcher,Wisconsin,Completed,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2301.10558,"Measles, Vaccination, Early childhood, Human capital, Incidence (geometry), Environmental health, Demography, Medicine, Immunology, Psychology, Economic growth, Economics, Developmental psychology, Sociology, Physics, Optics",,,
Sustainable Venture Capital,"Sustainability initiatives are set to benefit greatly from the growing
involvement of venture capital, in the same way that other technological
endeavours have been enabled and accelerated in the post-war period. With the
spoils increasingly being shared between shareholders and other stakeholders,
this requires a more nuanced view than the finance-first methodologies deployed
to date. Indeed, it is possible for a venture-backed sustainability startup to
deliver outstanding results to society in general without returning a cent to
investors, though the most promising outcomes deliver profit with purpose,
satisfying all stakeholders in ways that make existing 'extractive' venture
capital seem hollow.
  To explore this nascent area, a review of related research was conducted and
social entrepreneurs & investors interviewed to construct a questionnaire
assessing the interests and intentions of current & future ecosystem
participants. Analysis of 114 responses received via several sampling methods
revealed statistically significant relationships between investing preferences

"A Quantitative Framework for Network Resilience Evaluation using Dynamic
  Bayesian Network","Measuring and evaluating network resilience has become an important aspect
since the network is vulnerable to both uncertain disturbances and malicious
attacks. Networked systems are often composed of many dynamic components and
change over time, which makes it difficult for existing methods to access the
changeable situation of network resilience. This paper establishes a novel
quantitative framework for evaluating network resilience using the Dynamic
Bayesian Network. The proposed framework can be used to evaluate the network's
multi-stage resilience processes when suffering various attacks and recoveries.
First, we define the dynamic capacities of network components and establish the
network's five core resilience capabilities to describe the resilient
networking stages including preparation, resistance, adaptation, recovery, and
evolution; the five core resilience capabilities consist of rapid response
capability, sustained resistance capability, continuous running capability,
rapid convergence capability, and dynamic evolution capability. Then, we employ
a two-time slices approach based on the Dynamic Bayesian Network to quantify
five crucial performances of network resilience based on core capabilities
proposed above. The proposed approach can ensure the time continuity of
resilience evaluation in time-varying networks. Finally, our proposed
evaluation framework is applied to different attacks and recovery conditions in
typical simulations and real-world network topology. Results and comparisons
with extant studies indicate that the proposed method can achieve a more
accurate and comprehensive evaluation and can be applied to network scenarios
under various attack and recovery intensities.",Shanqing Jiang; Lin Yang; Guang Cheng; Xianming Gao; Tao Feng; Yuyang Zhou,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09040v1,False,True,False,False,False,907.0,Lisa K Bates,Chicago,Completed,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comcom.2022.07.042,"Computer science, Resilience (materials science), Dynamic Bayesian network, Bayesian network, Dynamic network analysis, Bayesian probability, Data mining, Artificial intelligence, Computer network, Physics, Thermodynamics",Southeast University,"Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration, Ministry of Education, Nanjing, China; School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China; National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Information System Security, Beijing, China","Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration, Ministry of Education, Nanjing, China; School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China; National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Information System Security, Beijing, China"
"Resilience-based performance modeling and decision optimization for
  transportation network","This research presented a novel resilience-based framework to support
resilience planning regarding pre-disaster mitigation and post-disaster
recovery.
  First, the author proposes a new performance metric for transportation
network, weighted number of independent pathways (WIPW), integrating the
network topology, redundancy level, traffic patterns, structural reliability of
network components, and functionality of the network during community's
post-disaster recovery in a systematical way. To the best of our knowledge,
WIPW is the only performance metric that permits risk mitigation alternatives
for improving transportation network resilience to be compared on a common
basis. Based on the WIPW, a decision methodology of prioritizing transportation
network retrofit projects is developed.
  Second, our studies extend from pre-disaster mitigation to post-hazard
recovery, in which this research presents two metrics to evaluate the
restoration over the horizon after disasters . That is, total recovery time and
the skew of the recovery trajectory. Both metrics are involved in the
multi-objective stochastic optimization problem of restoration scheduling. The
metrics provided a new dimension to evaluate the relative efficiency of
alternative network recovery strategies. The author then develops a restoration
scheduling methodology for network post-disaster recovery that minimizes the
overall network recovery time and optimizes the recovery trajectory, which
ultimately will reduce economic losses due to network service disruption.",Weili Zhang,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03761v1,False,True,False,False,False,907.0,Lisa K Bates,Chicago,Completed,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2015.08.059,"Network planning and design, Computer science, Resilience (materials science), Stochastic programming, Operations research, Natural disaster, Humanitarian Logistics, Economic shortage, Flow network, Plan (archaeology), Emergency management, Mathematical optimization, Operations management, Economics, Engineering, Mathematics, History, Computer network, Linguistics, Physics, Philosophy, Archaeology, Government (linguistics), Meteorology, Thermodynamics, Economic growth",University of Tehran; Brunel University of London,Brunel Business School Brunel University London UK; School of Industrial Engineering; College of Engineering; University of Tehran; Tehran Iran,Brunel Business School Brunel University London UK; School of Industrial Engineering; College of Engineering; University of Tehran; Tehran Iran
"Twin Estimates of the Effects of Prenatal Environment, Child Biology,
  and Parental Bias on Sex Differences in Early Age Mortality","Sex differences in early age mortality have been explained in prior
literature by differences in biological make-up and gender discrimination in
the allocation of household resources. Studies estimating the effects of these
factors have generally assumed that offspring sex ratio is random, which is
implausible in view of recent evidence that the sex of a child is partly
determined by prenatal environmental factors. These factors may also affect
child health and survival in utero or after birth, which implies that
conventional approaches to explaining sex differences in mortality are likely
to yield biased estimates. We propose a methodology for decomposing these
differences into the effects of prenatal environment, child biology, and
parental preferences. Using a large sample of twins, we compare mortality rates
in male-female twin pairs in India, a region known for discriminating against
daughters, and sub-Saharan Africa, a region where sons and daughters are
thought to be valued by their parents about equally. We find that: (1) prenatal
environment positively affects the mortality of male children; (2) biological
make-up of the latter contributes to their excess mortality, but its effect has
been previously overestimated; and (3) parental discrimination against female
children in India negatively affects their survival; but failure to control for
the effects of prenatal and biological factors leads conventional approaches to
underestimating its effect by 237 percent during infancy, and 44 percent during
childhood.",Roland Pongou,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05712v1,False,True,False,False,False,932.0,William R Walker,Berkeley,Completed,2017.0,,"Offspring, Demography, Affect (linguistics), Child mortality, In utero, Sex ratio, Pregnancy, Infant mortality, Prenatal exposure, Biology, Psychology, Fetus, Population, Genetics, Communication, Sociology",,,
"Mapping Informal Settlements in Developing Countries with
  Multi-resolution, Multi-spectral Data","Detecting and mapping informal settlements encompasses several of the United
Nations sustainable development goals. This is because informal settlements are
home to the most socially and economically vulnerable people on the planet.
Thus, understanding where these settlements are is of paramount importance to
both government and non-government organizations (NGOs), such as the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), who can use this information to deliver
effective social and economic aid. We propose two effective methods for
detecting and mapping the locations of informal settlements. One uses only
low-resolution (LR), freely available, Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite
imagery with noisy annotations, whilst the other is a deep learning approach
that uses only costly very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. To our
knowledge, we are the first to map informal settlements successfully with
low-resolution satellite imagery. We extensively evaluate and compare the
proposed methods. Please find additional material at

"Code Red: The Business Impact of Code Quality -- A Quantitative Study of
  39 Proprietary Production Codebases","Code quality remains an abstract concept that fails to get traction at the
business level. Consequently, software companies keep trading code quality for
time-to-market and new features. The resulting technical debt is estimated to
waste up to 42% of developers' time. At the same time, there is a global
shortage of software developers, meaning that developer productivity is key to
software businesses. Our overall mission is to make code quality a business
concern, not just a technical aspect. Our first goal is to understand how code
quality impacts 1) the number of reported defects, 2) the time to resolve
issues, and 3) the predictability of resolving issues on time. We analyze 39
proprietary production codebases from a variety of domains using the CodeScene
tool based on a combination of source code analysis, version-control mining,
and issue information from Jira. By analyzing activity in 30,737 files, we find
that low quality code contains 15 times more defects than high quality code.
Furthermore, resolving issues in low quality code takes on average 124% more
time in development. Finally, we report that issue resolutions in low quality
code involve higher uncertainty manifested as 9 times longer maximum cycle
times. This study provides evidence that code quality cannot be dismissed as a
technical concern. With 15 times fewer defects, twice the development speed,
and substantially more predictable issue resolution times, the business
advantage of high quality code should be unmistakably clear.",Adam Tornhill; Markus Borg,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04374v1,False,True,False,False,False,987.0,Kyle L Handley,Michigan,Completed,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2203.04374,"Computer science, Quality (philosophy), Code (set theory), Software quality, Predictability, Source code, Production (economics), Code review, Software, Software development, Database, Programming language, Set (abstract data type), Philosophy, Epistemology, Economics, Macroeconomics, Physics, Quantum mechanics",,,

census operations. The American Statistical Association 2020 Census Quality
Indicators Task Force selected the authors to conduct the evaluation using
nonpublic operations data provided by the Census Bureau.
  The evaluation focused on the quality of state-level population counts
released by the Census Bureau for congressional apportionment. The authors
first partitioned the census enumeration process into five operation phases.
Within each phase, one or more activities considered to be critical to census
data quality were identified. Operational data from each activity were then
analyzed to assess the risk of error, particularly as they related to similar
activities in the 2010 census.
  Overall, the evaluation found that census operations relied on higher risk
activities at a higher rate in 2020 than in 2010, suggesting that the risk of
error may be higher in 2020 than in 2010. However, the available data were
insufficient to determine whether the apportionment counts are of lower quality

"Zero-Shot ECG Classification with Multimodal Learning and Test-time
  Clinical Knowledge Enhancement","Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are non-invasive diagnostic tools crucial for
detecting cardiac arrhythmic diseases in clinical practice. While ECG
Self-supervised Learning (eSSL) methods show promise in representation learning
from unannotated ECG data, they often overlook the clinical knowledge that can
be found in reports. This oversight and the requirement for annotated samples
for downstream tasks limit eSSL's versatility. In this work, we address these
issues with the Multimodal ECG Representation Learning (MERL}) framework.
Through multimodal learning on ECG records and associated reports, MERL is
capable of performing zero-shot ECG classification with text prompts,
eliminating the need for training data in downstream tasks. At test time, we
propose the Clinical Knowledge Enhanced Prompt Engineering (CKEPE) approach,
which uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to exploit external expert-verified
clinical knowledge databases, generating more descriptive prompts and reducing
hallucinations in LLM-generated content to boost zero-shot classification.
Based on MERL, we perform the first benchmark across six public ECG datasets,
showing the superior performance of MERL compared against eSSL methods.
Notably, MERL achieves an average AUC score of 75.2% in zero-shot
classification (without training data), 3.2% higher than linear probed eSSL
methods with 10\% annotated training data, averaged across all six datasets.

An efficient counting method for the colored triad census,"The triad census is an important approach to understand local structure in
network science, providing comprehensive assessments of the observed relational
configurations between triples of actors in a network. However, researchers are
often interested in combinations of relational and categorical nodal
attributes. In this case, it is desirable to account for the label, or color,
of the nodes in the triad census. In this paper, we describe an efficient
algorithm for constructing the colored triad census, based, in part, on
existing methods for the classic triad census. We evaluate the performance of
the algorithm using empirical and simulated data for both undirected and
directed graphs. The results of the simulation demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm reduces computational time many-fold over the naive approach. We also
apply the colored triad census to the Zachary karate club network dataset. We
simultaneously show the efficiency of the algorithm, and a way to conduct a
statistical test on the census by forming a null distribution from 1,000
realizations of a mixing-matrix conditioned graph and comparing the observed
colored triad counts to the expected. From this, we demonstrate the method's
utility in our discussion of results about homophily, heterophily, and
bridging, simultaneously gained via the colored triad census. In sum, the
proposed algorithm for the colored triad census brings novel utility to social
network analysis in an efficient package.",Jeffrey Lienert; Laura Koehly; Felix Reed-Tsochas; Christopher Steven Marcum,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01481v2,False,True,False,False,False,997.0,Merle Ederhof,Michigan,Completed,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.04.003,"Colored, Triad (sociology), Computer science, Census, Psychology, Medicine, Environmental health, Population, Sociology, Psychoanalysis, Anthropology",National Human Genome Research Institute; National Institutes of Health; University of Oxford,"Oxford Martin School; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, United States; Saïd Business School, University of Oxford, United Kingdom","Oxford Martin School; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, United States; Saïd Business School, University of Oxford, United Kingdom"
House Price Modeling with Digital Census,"Urban house prices are strongly associated with local socioeconomic factors.
In literature, house price modeling is based on socioeconomic variables from
traditional census, which is not real-time, dynamic and comprehensive. Inspired
by the emerging concept of ""digital census"" - using large-scale digital records
of human activities to measure urban population dynamics and socioeconomic
conditions, we introduce three typical datasets, namely 311 complaints, crime
complaints and taxi trips, into house price modeling. Based on the individual
housing sales data in New York City, we provide comprehensive evidence that
these digital census datasets can substantially improve the modeling
performances on both house price levels and changes, regardless whether
traditional census is included or not. Hence, digital census can serve as both
effective alternatives and complements to traditional census for house price
modeling.",Enwei Zhu; Stanislav Sobolevsky,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03834v1,False,True,False,False,False,997.0,Merle Ederhof,Michigan,Completed,2019.0,,"Census, House price, Socioeconomic status, TRIPS architecture, Geography, Scale (ratio), Population, Econometrics, Regional science, Computer science, Economics, Cartography, Demography, Sociology, Parallel computing",,,
"Intervention scenarios to enhance knowledge transfer in a network of
  firm","We investigate a multi-agent model of firms in an R\&D network. Each firm is
characterized by its knowledge stock $x_{i}(t)$, which follows a non-linear
dynamics. It can grow with the input from other firms, i.e., by knowledge
transfer, and decays otherwise. Maintaining interactions is costly. Firms can
leave the network if their expected knowledge growth is not realized, which may
cause other firms to also leave the network. The paper discusses two bottom-up
intervention scenarios to prevent, reduce, or delay cascades of firms leaving.
The first one is based on the formalism of network controllability, in which
driver nodes are identified and subsequently incentivized, by reducing their
costs. The second one combines node interventions and network interventions. It
proposes the controlled removal of a single firm and the random replacement of
firms leaving. This allows to generate small cascades, which prevents the
occurrence of large cascades. We find that both approaches successfully
mitigate cascades and thus improve the resilience of the R\&D network.",Frank Schweitzer; Yan Zhang; Giona Casiraghi,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14249v1,False,True,False,False,False,1000.0,Douglas V Almond,Baruch,Completed,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2020.00382,"Knowledge transfer, Knowledge management, Intervention (counseling), Business, Computer science, Psychology, Psychiatry",ETH Zurich,"Chair of Systems Design, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland","Chair of Systems Design, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"
"Relatedness, Knowledge Diffusion, and the Evolution of Bilateral Trade","During the last decades two important contributions have reshaped our
understanding of international trade. First, countries trade more with those
with whom they share history, language, and culture, suggesting that trade is
limited by information frictions. Second, countries are more likely to start
exporting products that are similar to their current exports, suggesting that
knowledge diffusion among related industries is a key constrain shaping the
diversification of exports. But does knowledge about how to export to a
destination also diffuses among related products and geographic neighbors? Do
countries need to learn how to trade each product to each destination? Here, we
use bilateral trade data from 2000 to 2015 to show that countries are more
likely to increase their exports of a product to a destination when: (i) they
export related products to it, (ii) they export the same product to the
neighbor of a destination, (iii) they have neighbors who export the same
product to that destination. Then, we explore the magnitude of these effects
for new, nascent, and experienced exporters, (exporters with and without
comparative advantage in a product) and also for groups of products with
different level of technological sophistication. We find that the effects of
product and geographic relatedness are stronger for new exporters, and also,
that the effect of product relatedness is stronger for more technologically
sophisticated products. These findings support the idea that international
trade is shaped by information frictions that are reduced in the presence of
related products and experienced geographic neighbors.",Bogang Jun; Aamena Alshamsi; Jian Gao; Cesar A Hidalgo,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05392v1,False,True,False,False,False,1027.0,Andrew J Cassey,Seattle,Completed,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00191-019-00638-7,"Sophistication, Diversification (marketing strategy), Destinations, Product (mathematics), Bilateral trade, International trade, Developing country, Business, Country of origin, Gravity model of trade, Product differentiation, Economics, International economics, Marketing, Tourism, Microeconomics, Geography, Geometry, Mathematics, Archaeology, Sociology, Cournot competition, Economic growth, China, Social science",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Collective Learning Group, MIT Media Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA","Collective Learning Group, MIT Media Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA"
Predicting Exporters with Machine Learning,"In this contribution, we exploit machine learning techniques to evaluate
whether and how close firms are to becoming successful exporters. First, we
train and test various algorithms using financial information on both exporters
and non-exporters in France in 2010-2018. Thus, we show that we are able to
predict the distance of non-exporters from export status. In particular, we
find that a Bayesian Additive Regression Tree with Missingness In Attributes
(BART-MIA) performs better than other techniques with an accuracy of up to
0.90. Predictions are robust to changes in definitions of exporters and in the
presence of discontinuous exporting activity. Eventually, we discuss how our
exporting scores can be helpful for trade promotion, trade credit, and
assessing aggregate trade potential. For example, back-of-the-envelope
estimates show that a representative firm with just below-average exporting
scores needs up to 44% more cash resources and up to 2.5 times more capital to
get to foreign markets.",Francesca Micocci; Armando Rungi,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02512v2,False,True,False,False,False,1027.0,Andrew J Cassey,Seattle,Completed,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3882811,"Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Computer science, Business",IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca,Scuola IMT Alti Studi Lucca; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca,Scuola IMT Alti Studi Lucca; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca

multinational firms to get a favorable salary. However, if the host country

Bayesian Semiparametric Hierarchical Empirical Likelihood Spatial Models,"We introduce a general hierarchical Bayesian framework that incorporates a
flexible nonparametric data model specification through the use of empirical
likelihood methodology, which we term semiparametric hierarchical empirical
likelihood (SHEL) models. Although general dependence structures can be readily
accommodated, we focus on spatial modeling, a relatively underdeveloped area in
the empirical likelihood literature. Importantly, the models we develop
naturally accommodate spatial association on irregular lattices and irregularly
spaced point-referenced data. We illustrate our proposed framework by means of
a simulation study and through three real data examples. First, we develop a
spatial Fay-Herriot model in the SHEL framework and apply it to the problem of
small area estimation in the American Community Survey. Next, we illustrate the
SHEL model in the context of areal data (on an irregular lattice) through the
North Carolina sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) dataset. Finally, we analyze
a point-referenced dataset from the North American Breeding Bird survey that
considers dove counts for the state of Missouri. In all cases, we demonstrate

"Bayesian binomial mixture models for estimating abundance in ecological
  monitoring studies","Investigation of species abundance has become a vital component of many
ecological monitoring studies. The primary objective of these studies is to
understand how specific species are distributed across the study domain, as
well as quantification of the sampling efficiency for detecting these species.
To achieve these goals, preselected locations are sampled during scheduled
visits, in which the number of species observed at each location is recorded.
This results in spatially referenced replicated count data that are often
unbalanced in structure and exhibit overdispersion. Motivated by the Baltimore
Ecosystem Study, we propose Bayesian hierarchical binomial mixture models,
including Binomial Conway-Maxwell Poisson (Bin-CMP) mixture models, that
formally account for varying levels of spatial dispersion. Our proposed models
also allow for variable selection of model covariates and grouping of
dispersion parameters through the implementation of reversible jump Markov
chain Monte Carlo methodology. Finally, using demographic covariates from the
American Community Survey, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through estimation of abundance for the American Robin (Turdus migratorius) in
the Baltimore Ecosystem Study.",Guohui Wu; Scott H. Holan; Charles H. Nilon; Christopher K.

"Small Area Estimation via Multivariate Fay-Herriot Models with Latent
  Spatial Dependence","The Fay-Herriot model is a standard model for direct survey estimators in
which the true quantity of interest, the superpopulation mean, is latent and
its estimation is improved through the use of auxiliary covariates. In the
context of small area estimation, these estimates can be further improved by
borrowing strength across spatial region or by considering multiple outcomes
simultaneously. We provide here two formulations to perform small area
estimation with Fay-Herriot models that include both multivariate outcomes and
latent spatial dependence. We consider two model formulations, one in which the
outcome-by-space dependence structure is separable and one that accounts for
the cross dependence through the use of a generalized multivariate conditional
autoregressive (GMCAR) structure. The GMCAR model is shown in a state-level
example to produce smaller mean square prediction errors, relative to
equivalent census variables, than the separable model and the state-of-the-art
multivariate model with unstructured dependence between outcomes and no spatial
dependence. In addition, both the GMCAR and the separable models give smaller
mean squared prediction error than the state-of-the-art model when conducting
small area estimation on county level data from the American Community Survey.",Aaron T. Porter; Christopher K. Wikle; Scott H.

"Conjugate Modeling Approaches for Small Area Estimation with
  Heteroscedastic Structure","Small area estimation has become an important tool in official statistics,
used to construct estimates of population quantities for domains with small
sample sizes. Typical area-level models function as a type of heteroscedastic
regression, where the variance for each domain is assumed to be known and
plugged in following a design-based estimate. Recent work has considered
hierarchical models for the variance, where the design-based estimates are used
as an additional data point to model the latent true variance in each domain.
These hierarchical models may incorporate covariate information, but can be
difficult to sample from in high-dimensional settings. Utilizing recent
distribution theory, we explore a class of Bayesian hierarchical models for
small area estimation that smooth both the design-based estimate of the mean
and the variance. In addition, we develop a class of unit-level models for
heteroscedastic Gaussian response data. Importantly, we incorporate both
covariate information as well as spatial dependence, while retaining a
conjugate model structure that allows for efficient sampling. We illustrate our
methodology through an empirical simulation study as well as an application
using data from the American Community Survey.",Paul A. Parker; Scott H.

Economic decision making: application of the theory of complex systems,"In this chapter the complex systems are discussed in the context of economic
and business policy and decision making. It will be showed and motivated that
social systems are typically chaotic, non-linear and/or non-equilibrium and
therefore complex systems. It is discussed that the rapid change in global
consumer behaviour is underway, that further increases the complexity in
business and management. For policy making under complexity, following
principles are offered: openness and international competition, tolerance and
variety of ideas, self-reliability and low dependence on external help. The
chapter contains four applications that build on the theoretical motivation of
complexity in social systems. The first application demonstrates that small
economies have good prospects to gain from the global processes underway, if
they can demonstrate production flexibility, reliable business ethics and good
risk management. The second application elaborates on and discusses the
opportunities and challenges in decision making under complexity from macro and
micro economic perspective. In this environment, the challenges for corporate
management are being also permanently changed: the balance between short term
noise and long term chaos whose attractor includes customers, shareholders and
employees must be found. The emergence of chaos in economic relationships is
demonstrated by a simple system of differential equations that relate the
stakeholders described above. The chapter concludes with two financial
applications: about debt and risk management. The non-equilibrium economic
establishment leads to additional problems by using excessive borrowing;
unexpected downturns in economy can more easily kill companies. Finally, the
demand for quantitative improvements in risk management is postulated.",Robert Kitt,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1277v2,False,True,False,False,False,1091.0,Jie He,Atlanta,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-8691-1_4,"Flexibility (engineering), Context (archaeology), Risk analysis (engineering), Openness to experience, Economics, Complex adaptive system, Variety (cybernetics), Management science, Competition (biology), Risk management, Business, Industrial organization, Computer science, Finance, Psychology, Paleontology, Social psychology, Ecology, Management, Artificial intelligence, Biology",Tallinn University of Technology,"Department of Mechanics and Applied Mathematics, Institute of Cybernetics, Tallinn University of Technology, Akadeemia tee 21, 12618, Tallinn, Estonia","Department of Mechanics and Applied Mathematics, Institute of Cybernetics, Tallinn University of Technology, Akadeemia tee 21, 12618, Tallinn, Estonia"
"The interplay between migrants and natives as a determinant of migrants'
  assimilation: A coevolutionary approach","We study the migrants' assimilation, which we conceptualize as forming human
capital productive on the labor market of a developed host country, and we link
the observed frequent lack of assimilation with the relative deprivation that
the migrants start to feel when they move in social space towards the natives.
In turn, we presume that the native population is heterogenous and consists of
high-skill and low-skill workers. The presence of assimilated migrants might
shape the comparison group of the natives, influencing the relative deprivation
of the low-skill workers and, in consequence, the choice to form human capital
and become highly skilled. To analyse this interrelation between assimilation
choices of migrants and skill formation of natives, we construct a
coevolutionary model of the open-to-migration economy. Showing that the economy
might end up in a non-assimilation equilibrium, we discuss welfare consequences
of an assimilation policy funded from tax levied on the native population. We
identify conditions under which such costly policy can bring the migrants to
assimilation and at the same time increase the welfare of the natives, even
though the incomes of the former take a beating.",Jakub Bielawski; Marcin Jakubek,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02657v1,False,True,False,False,False,1092.0,Christian Dippel,UCLA,Completed,2017.0,,"Assimilation (phonology), Human capital, Welfare, Economics, Population, Cultural assimilation, Demographic economics, Immigration, Labour economics, Sociology, Geography, Economic growth, Market economy, Philosophy, Linguistics, Demography, Archaeology",,,
"Sparse Models and Methods for Optimal Instruments with an Application to
  Eminent Domain","We develop results for the use of Lasso and Post-Lasso methods to form
first-stage predictions and estimate optimal instruments in linear instrumental
variables (IV) models with many instruments, $p$. Our results apply even when
$p$ is much larger than the sample size, $n$. We show that the IV estimator
based on using Lasso or Post-Lasso in the first stage is root-n consistent and
asymptotically normal when the first-stage is approximately sparse; i.e. when
the conditional expectation of the endogenous variables given the instruments
can be well-approximated by a relatively small set of variables whose
identities may be unknown. We also show the estimator is semi-parametrically
efficient when the structural error is homoscedastic. Notably our results allow
for imperfect model selection, and do not rely upon the unrealistic ""beta-min""
conditions that are widely used to establish validity of inference following
model selection. In simulation experiments, the Lasso-based IV estimator with a
data-driven penalty performs well compared to recently advocated
many-instrument-robust procedures. In an empirical example dealing with the
effect of judicial eminent domain decisions on economic outcomes, the
Lasso-based IV estimator outperforms an intuitive benchmark.
  In developing the IV results, we establish a series of new results for Lasso
and Post-Lasso estimators of nonparametric conditional expectation functions
which are of independent theoretical and practical interest. We construct a
modification of Lasso designed to deal with non-Gaussian, heteroscedastic
disturbances which uses a data-weighted $\ell_1$-penalty function. Using
moderate deviation theory for self-normalized sums, we provide convergence
rates for the resulting Lasso and Post-Lasso estimators that are as sharp as
the corresponding rates in the homoscedastic Gaussian case under the condition
that $\log p = o(n^{1/3})$.",Alexandre Belloni; Daniel Chen; Victor Chernozhukov; Christian Hansen,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.4345v5,False,True,False,False,False,1099.0,Daniel L Chen,Triangle,Completed,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.3982/ecta9626,"Domain (mathematical analysis), Computer science, Econometrics, Mathematics, Mathematical analysis",,,
"Artificial Intelligence in the Service of Entrepreneurial Finance:

tradition, its potential in Entrepreneurship has been intensively explored only
recently. In this context, Entrepreneurial Finance is a particularly fertile
ground for future Artificial Intelligence proliferation. To support the latter,
the study provides a bibliometric review of Artificial Intelligence
applications in (1) entrepreneurial finance literature, and (2) corporate
finance literature with implications for Entrepreneurship. Rigorous search and
screening procedures of the scientific database Web of Science Core Collection
resulted in the identification of 1890 relevant journal articles subjected to
analysis. The bibliometric analysis gives a rich insight into the knowledge
field's conceptual, intellectual, and social structure, indicating nascent and
underdeveloped research directions. As far as we were able to identify, this is
the first study to map and bibliometrically analyze the academic field
concerning the relationship between Artificial Intelligence, Entrepreneurship,
and Finance, and the first review that deals with Artificial Intelligence
methods in Entrepreneurship. According to the results, Artificial Neural

Bounds for Approximate Regret-Matching Algorithms,"A dominant approach to solving large imperfect-information games is
Counterfactural Regret Minimization (CFR). In CFR, many regret minimization
problems are combined to solve the game. For very large games, abstraction is
typically needed to render CFR tractable. Abstractions are often manually
tuned, possibly removing important strategic differences in the full game and
harming performance. Function approximation provides a natural solution to
finding good abstractions to approximate the full game. A common approach to
incorporating function approximation is to learn the inputs needed for a regret
minimizing algorithm, allowing for generalization across many regret
minimization problems. This paper gives regret bounds when a regret minimizing
algorithm uses estimates instead of true values. This form of analysis is the
first to generalize to a larger class of $(\Phi, f)$-regret matching
algorithms, and includes different forms of regret such as swap, internal, and
external regret. We demonstrate how these results give a slightly tighter bound
for Regression Regret-Matching (RRM), and present a novel bound for combining
regression with Hedge.",Ryan D'Orazio; Dustin Morrill; James R.

A Novel Microdata Privacy Disclosure Risk Measure,"A tremendous amount of individual-level data is generated each day, of use to
marketing, decision makers, and machine learning applications. This data often
contain private and sensitive information about individuals, which can be
disclosed by adversaries. An adversary can recognize the underlying
individual's identity for a data record by looking at the values of
quasi-identifier attributes, known as identity disclosure, or can uncover
sensitive information about an individual through attribute disclosure. In
Statistical Disclosure Control, multiple disclosure risk measures have been
proposed. These share two drawbacks: they do not consider identity and
attribute disclosure concurrently in the risk measure, and they make
restrictive assumptions on an adversary's knowledge by assuming certain
attributes are quasi-identifiers and there is a clear boundary between
quasi-identifiers and sensitive information. In this paper, we present a novel
disclosure risk measure that addresses these limitations, by presenting a
single combined metric of identity and attribute disclosure risk, and providing
flexibility in modeling adversary's knowledge. We have developed an efficient
algorithm for computing the proposed risk measure and evaluated the feasibility
and performance of our approach on a real-world data set from the domain of
social work.",Marmar Orooji; Gerald M.

"Comparing the Utility and Disclosure Risk of Synthetic Data with Samples
  of Microdata","Most statistical agencies release randomly selected samples of Census
microdata, usually with sample fractions under 10% and with other forms of
statistical disclosure control (SDC) applied. An alternative to SDC is data
synthesis, which has been attracting growing interest, yet there is no clear
consensus on how to measure the associated utility and disclosure risk of the
data. The ability to produce synthetic Census microdata, where the utility and
associated risks are clearly understood, could mean that more timely and
wider-ranging access to microdata would be possible.
  This paper follows on from previous work by the authors which mapped
synthetic Census data on a risk-utility (R-U) map. The paper presents a
framework to measure the utility and disclosure risk of synthetic data by
comparing it to samples of the original data of varying sample fractions,
thereby identifying the sample fraction which has equivalent utility and risk
to the synthetic data. Three commonly used data synthesis packages are compared

"Studying Preferences and Concerns about Information Disclosure in Email
  Notifications","The proliferation of network-connected devices and applications has resulted
in people receiving dozens, or hundreds, of notifications per day. When people
are in the presence of others, each notification poses some risk of accidental
information disclosure; onlookers may see notifications appear above the lock
screen of a mobile phone, on the periphery of a desktop or laptop display, or
projected onscreen during a presentation. In this paper, we quantify the
prevalence of these accidental disclosures in the context of email
notifications, and we study people's relevant preferences and concerns. Our
results are compiled from an exploratory retrospective survey of 131
respondents, and a separate contextual-labeling study in which 169 participants
labeled 1,040 meeting-email pairs. We find that, for 53% of people, at least 1
in 10 email notifications poses an information disclosure risk. We also find
that the real or perceived severity of these risks depend both on user
characteristics and attributes of the meeting or email (e.g. the number of
recipients or attendees). We conclude by exploring machine learning algorithms

Survey on Privacy-Preserving Techniques for Data Publishing,"The exponential growth of collected, processed, and shared microdata has
given rise to concerns about individuals' privacy. As a result, laws and
regulations have emerged to control what organisations do with microdata and
how they protect it. Statistical Disclosure Control seeks to reduce the risk of
confidential information disclosure by de-identifying them. Such
de-identification is guaranteed through privacy-preserving techniques. However,
de-identified data usually results in loss of information, with a possible
impact on data analysis precision and model predictive performance. The main
goal is to protect the individuals' privacy while maintaining the
interpretability of the data, i.e. its usefulness. Statistical Disclosure
Control is an area that is expanding and needs to be explored since there is
still no solution that guarantees optimal privacy and utility. This survey
focuses on all steps of the de-identification process. We present existing
privacy-preserving techniques used in microdata de-identification, privacy
measures suitable for several disclosure types and, information loss and
predictive performance measures. In this survey, we discuss the main challenges

"Assessing the protection provided by misclassification-based disclosure
  limitation methods for survey microdata","Government statistical agencies often apply statistical disclosure limitation
techniques to survey microdata to protect the confidentiality of respondents.
There is a need for valid and practical ways to assess the protection provided.
This paper develops some simple methods for disclosure limitation techniques
which perturb the values of categorical identifying variables. The methods are
applied in numerical experiments based upon census data from the United Kingdom
which are subject to two perturbation techniques: data swapping (random and
targeted) and the post randomization method. Some simplifying approximations to
the measure of risk are found to work well in capturing the impacts of these
techniques. These approximations provide simple extensions of existing risk
assessment methods based upon Poisson log-linear models. A numerical experiment
is also undertaken to assess the impact of multivariate misclassification with
an increasing number of identifying variables. It is found that the
misclassification dominates the usual monotone increasing relationship between
this number and risk so that the risk eventually declines, implying less
sensitivity of risk to choice of identifying variables. The methods developed
in this paper may also be used to obtain more realistic assessments of risk
which take account of the kinds of measurement and other nonsampling errors
commonly arising in surveys.",Natalie Shlomo; Chris Skinner,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.2905v1,False,True,False,False,False,1157.0,Kristine M Witkowski,Michigan,Completed,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1214/09-aoas317,"Categorical variable, Microdata (statistics), Computer science, Poisson distribution, Econometrics, Confidentiality, Data mining, Estimator, Randomized response, Risk assessment, Statistics, Risk analysis (engineering), Actuarial science, Data science, Mathematics, Machine learning, Census, Computer security, Medicine, Population, Demography, Sociology, Business",University of Southampton,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON SOUTHAMPTON, SO17 1BJ UNITED KINGDOM; University of Southampton","SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON SOUTHAMPTON, SO17 1BJ UNITED KINGDOM; University of Southampton"

"Populist Discourse and Entrepreneurship: The Role of Political Ideology
  and Institutions","Using institutional economic theory as our guiding framework, we develop a
model to describe how populist discourse by a nation's political leader
influences entrepreneurship. We hypothesize that populist discourse reduces
entrepreneurship by creating regime uncertainty concerning the future stability
of the institutional environment, resulting in entrepreneurs anticipating
higher future transaction costs. Our model highlights two important factors
that moderate the relationship. First, is the strength of political checks and
balances, which we hypothesize weakens the negative relationship between
populist discourse and entrepreneurship by providing entrepreneurs with greater
confidence that the actions of a populist will be constrained. Second, the
political ideology of the leader moderates the relationship between populist
discourse and entrepreneurship. The anti-capitalistic rhetoric of left-wing
populism will create greater regime uncertainty than right-wing populism, which
is often accompanied by rhetoric critical of free trade and foreigners but also
supportive of business interests. The effect of centrist populism, which is
accompanied by a mix of contradictory and often moderate ideas that make it
difficult to discern future transaction costs, will have a weaker negative
effect on entrepreneurship than either left-wing or right-wing populism. We
empirically test our model using a multi-level design and a dataset comprised
of more than 780,000 individuals in 33 countries over the period 2002-2016. Our
analysis largely supports our theory regarding the moderating role of ideology.
Still, surprisingly, our findings suggest that the negative effect of populism
on entrepreneurship is greater in nations with stronger checks and balances.",Daniel L. Bennett; Christopher J. Boudreaux; Boris N.

Suicide ideation of individuals in online social networks,"Suicide explains the largest number of death tolls among Japanese adolescents
in their twenties and thirties. Suicide is also a major cause of death for
adolescents in many other countries. Although social isolation has been
implicated to influence the tendency to suicidal behavior, the impact of social
isolation on suicide in the context of explicit social networks of individuals
is scarcely explored. To address this question, we examined a large data set
obtained from a social networking service dominant in Japan. The social network
is composed of a set of friendship ties between pairs of users created by
mutual endorsement. We carried out the logistic regression to identify users'
characteristics, both related and unrelated to social networks, which
contribute to suicide ideation. We defined suicide ideation of a user as the
membership to at least one active user-defined community related to suicide. We
found that the number of communities to which a user belongs to, the
intransitivity (i.e., paucity of triangles including the user), and the
fraction of suicidal neighbors in the social network, contributed the most to
suicide ideation in this order. Other characteristics including the age and
gender contributed little to suicide ideation. We also found qualitatively the
same results for depressive symptoms.",Naoki Masuda; Issei Kurahashi; Hiroko Onari,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0561v3,False,True,False,False,False,1188.0,David A Boulifard,Chicago,Completed,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0062262,"Suicidal ideation, Social isolation, Context (archaeology), Friendship, Social network (sociolinguistics), Suicide prevention, Social support, Set (abstract data type), Poison control, Psychology, Psychiatry, Computer security, Medicine, Social psychology, Social media, Medical emergency, World Wide Web, Geography, Computer science, Archaeology, Programming language",iAnalysis (Japan); The University of Tokyo,"iAnalysis LLC, 2-2-15 Minamiaoyama, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Mathematical Informatics, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan","iAnalysis LLC, 2-2-15 Minamiaoyama, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Mathematical Informatics, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"
"Enhanced Suicidal Ideation Detection from Social Media Using a
  CNN-BiLSTM Hybrid Model","Suicidal ideation detection is crucial for preventing suicides, a leading
cause of death worldwide. Many individuals express suicidal thoughts on social
media, offering a vital opportunity for early detection through advanced
machine learning techniques. The identification of suicidal ideation in social
media text is improved by utilising a hybrid framework that integrates
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory
(BiLSTM), enhanced with an attention mechanism. To enhance the interpretability
of the model's predictions, Explainable AI (XAI) methods are applied, with a
particular focus on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), are incorporated. At
first, the model managed to reach an accuracy of 92.81%. By applying
fine-tuning and early stopping techniques, the accuracy improved to 94.29%. The
SHAP analysis revealed key features influencing the model's predictions, such
as terms related to mental health struggles. This level of transparency boosts
the model's credibility while helping mental health professionals understand
and trust the predictions. This work highlights the potential for improving the
accuracy and interpretability of detecting suicidal tendencies, making a
valuable contribution to the progress of mental health monitoring systems. It
emphasizes the significance of blending powerful machine learning methods with

Network Pruning via Resource Reallocation,"Channel pruning is broadly recognized as an effective approach to obtain a
small compact model through eliminating unimportant channels from a large
cumbersome network. Contemporary methods typically perform iterative pruning
procedure from the original over-parameterized model, which is both tedious and
expensive especially when the pruning is aggressive. In this paper, we propose
a simple yet effective channel pruning technique, termed network Pruning via
rEsource rEalLocation (PEEL), to quickly produce a desired slim model with
negligible cost. Specifically, PEEL first constructs a predefined backbone and
then conducts resource reallocation on it to shift parameters from less
informative layers to more important layers in one round, thus amplifying the
positive effect of these informative layers. To demonstrate the effectiveness
of PEEL , we perform extensive experiments on ImageNet with ResNet-18,
ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3-small and EfficientNet-B0. Experimental
results show that structures uncovered by PEEL exhibit competitive performance
with state-of-the-art pruning algorithms under various pruning settings. Our

Contrastive Pre-training for Imbalanced Corporate Credit Ratings,"Corporate credit rating reflects the level of corporate credit and plays a
crucial role in modern financial risk control. But real-world credit rating

inspried by the recent advances of pre-train techniques in self-supervised
representation learning, we propose a novel framework named Contrastive
Pre-training for Corporate Credit Rating (CP4CCR), which utilizes the
self-surpervision for getting over class imbalance. Specifically, we propose
to, in the first phase, exert constrastive self-superivised pre-training
without label information, which want to learn a better class-agnostic
initialization. During this phase, two self-supervised task are developed
within CP4CCR: (i) Feature Masking (FM) and (ii) Feature Swapping(FS). In the
second phase, we can train any standard corporate redit rating model
initialized by the pre-trained network. Extensive experiments conducted on the

evidence that the C-spread is cointegrated with both this credit spread and the

scenario investigated here, each user is willing to coordinate its actions only
when an incentive exists and benefits of cooperation are fairly allocated. The
users are first allowed to negotiate for the use of a simple Han-Kobayashi type
scheme with fixed power split. Conditions for which users have incentives to
cooperate are identified. Then, two different approaches are used to solve the
associated bargaining problem. First, the Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) is
used as a tool to get fair information rates and the operating point is
obtained as a result of an optimization problem. Next, a dynamic
alternating-offer bargaining game (AOBG) from bargaining theory is introduced
to model the bargaining process and the rates resulting from negotiation are
characterized. The relationship between the NBS and the equilibrium outcome of
the AOBG is studied and factors that may affect the bargaining outcome are
discussed. Finally, under certain high signal-to-noise ratio regimes, the
bargaining problem for the generalized degrees of freedom is studied.",Xi Liu; Elza Erkip,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.3574v1,False,True,False,False,False,1273.0,Sebastian Heise,Baruch,Completed,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1109/tit.2011.2120410,"Bargaining problem, Outcome (game theory), Negotiation, Bargaining power, Computer science, Channel (broadcasting), Game theory, Mathematical economics, Microeconomics, Complete information, Incentive, Interference (communication), Mathematical optimization, Economics, Mathematics, Telecommunications, Political science, Law",New York University; SUNY Polytechnic Institute,"Polytech.

"Impacts of Differential Privacy on Fostering more Racially and
  Ethnically Diverse Elementary Schools","In the face of increasingly severe privacy threats in the era of data and AI,
the US Census Bureau has recently adopted differential privacy, the de facto
standard of privacy protection for the 2020 Census release. Enforcing
differential privacy involves adding carefully calibrated random noise to
sensitive demographic information prior to its release. This change has the
potential to impact policy decisions like political redistricting and other
high-stakes practices, partly because tremendous federal funds and resources
are allocated according to datasets (like Census data) released by the US
government. One under-explored yet important application of such data is the
redrawing of school attendance boundaries to foster less demographically
segregated schools. In this study, we ask: how differential privacy might
impact diversity-promoting boundaries in terms of resulting levels of
segregation, student travel times, and school switching requirements?
Simulating alternative boundaries using differentially-private student counts
across 67 Georgia districts, we find that increasing data privacy requirements
decreases the extent to which alternative boundaries might reduce segregation
and foster more diverse and integrated schools, largely by reducing the number
of students who would switch schools under boundary changes. Impacts on travel
times are minimal. These findings point to a privacy-diversity tradeoff local
educational policymakers may face in forthcoming years, particularly as
computational methods are increasingly poised to facilitate attendance boundary
redrawings in the pursuit of less segregated schools.",Keyu Zhu; Nabeel Gillani; Pascal Van Hentenryck,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07762v1,True,True,False,False,False,1310.0,Salvatore Saporito,Cornell,Completed,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2305.07762,"Differential privacy, Diversity (politics), Attendance, Census, Government (linguistics), Face (sociological concept), Gerrymandering, Survey data collection, Boundary (topology), Business, Political science, Internet privacy, Public relations, Politics, Computer science, Sociology, Law, Data mining, Mathematical analysis, Population, Linguistics, Philosophy, Social science, Demography, Statistics, Mathematics, Democracy",,,
Federated Learning and Free-riding in a Competitive Market,"Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative technique for training large-scale
models while protecting user data privacy. Despite its substantial benefits,
the free-riding behavior raises a major challenge for the formation of FL,
especially in competitive markets. Our paper explores this under-explored issue
on how the free-riding behavior in a competitive market affects firms'
incentives to form FL. Competing firms can improve technologies through forming
FL to increase the performance of their products, which in turn, affects
consumers' product selection and market size. The key complication is whether
the free-riding behavior discourages information contribution by participating
firms and results in the decomposition of FL, and even free riding does not
discourage information contribution, this does not necessarily mean that a firm
wants to form FL in a competitive market because free riding may reshape the
competition positions of each participating firm and thus forming FL may not be
profitable. We build a parsimonious game theoretical model that captures these
interactions and our analyses show several new findings. First, even in the
presence of the free-riding behavior, competing firms under FL find it optimal
to contribute all its available information. Second, the firm with less amount
of information always finds it profitable to free ride; whether its rival (with
more amount of information) have an incentive to form FL only when the level of
competition or when the gap in information volume is not high. Third, when FL
is formed, there exists an ""All-Win"" situation in which all stakeholders
(participating firms, consumers, and social planner) benefit. Last, subsidizing
by the free-riding firm can align its rival's incentive to form FL only when
the level of competition is intermediate.",Jiajun Meng; Jing Chen; Dongfang Zhao; Lin Liu,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12723v1,False,True,False,False,False,1314.0,Ildiko Magyari,Baruch,Completed,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2410.12723,"Free riding, Business, Industrial organization, Free market, Microeconomics, Economics, Political science, Politics, Law, Incentive",,,
Fair Compensation,"We introduce a novel framework that considers how a firm could fairly
compensate its workers. A firm has a group of workers, each of whom has varying
productivities over a set of tasks. After assigning workers to tasks, the firm
must then decide how to distribute its output to the workers. We first consider
three compensation rules and various fairness properties they may satisfy. We
show that among efficient and symmetric rules: the Egalitarian rule is the only
rule that does not decrease a worker's compensation when every worker becomes
weakly more productive (Group Productivity Monotonicity); the Shapley Value
rule is the only rule that, for any two workers, equalizes the impact one
worker has on the other worker's compensation (Balanced Impact); and the
Individual Contribution rule is the only rule that is invariant to the removal
of workers and their assigned tasks (Consistency). We introduce other rules and
axioms, and relate each rule to each axiom.",John E.

Using Deep Learning to Generate Complete Log Statements,"Logging is a practice widely adopted in several phases of the software
lifecycle. For example, during software development log statements allow
engineers to verify and debug the system by exposing fine-grained information
of the running software. While the benefits of logging are undisputed, taking
proper decisions about where to inject log statements, what information to log,
and at which log level (e.g., error, warning) is crucial for the logging
effectiveness. In this paper, we present LANCE (Log stAtemeNt reCommEnder), the
first approach supporting developers in all these decisions. LANCE features a
Text-To-Text-Transfer-Transformer (T5) model that has been trained on 6,894,456
Java methods. LANCE takes as input a Java method and injects in it a full log
statement, including a human-comprehensible logging message and properly
choosing the needed log level and the statement location. Our results show that
LANCE is able to (i) properly identify the location in the code where to inject
the statement in 65.9% of Java methods requiring it; (ii) selecting the proper
log level in 66.2% of cases; and (iii) generate a completely correct log
statement including a meaningful logging message in 15.2% of cases.",Antonio Mastropaolo; Luca Pascarella; Gabriele Bavota,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04837v2,False,True,False,False,False,1329.0,Lance Freeman,Baruch,Completed,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1145/3510003.3511561,"Statement (logic), Computer science, Debugging, Java, Logging, Software, Code (set theory), Programming language, Software engineering, Data mining, Database, Ecology, Set (abstract data type), Political science, Law, Biology",Università della Svizzera italiana,"Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland","Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland"
"FreeMan: Towards Benchmarking 3D Human Pose Estimation under Real-World
  Conditions","Estimating the 3D structure of the human body from natural scenes is a
fundamental aspect of visual perception. 3D human pose estimation is a vital
step in advancing fields like AIGC and human-robot interaction, serving as a
crucial technique for understanding and interacting with human actions in
real-world settings. However, the current datasets, often collected under
single laboratory conditions using complex motion capture equipment and
unvarying backgrounds, are insufficient. The absence of datasets on variable
conditions is stalling the progress of this crucial task. To facilitate the
development of 3D pose estimation, we present FreeMan, the first large-scale,
multi-view dataset collected under the real-world conditions. FreeMan was
captured by synchronizing 8 smartphones across diverse scenarios. It comprises
11M frames from 8000 sequences, viewed from different perspectives. These
sequences cover 40 subjects across 10 different scenarios, each with varying
lighting conditions. We have also established an semi-automated pipeline
containing error detection to reduce the workload of manual check and ensure
precise annotation. We provide comprehensive evaluation baselines for a range
of tasks, underlining the significant challenges posed by FreeMan. Further
evaluations of standard indoor/outdoor human sensing datasets reveal that
FreeMan offers robust representation transferability in real and complex

"Advancing Ischemic Stroke Diagnosis: A Novel Two-Stage Approach for
  Blood Clot Origin Identification","An innovative two-stage methodology for categorizing blood clot origins is
presented in this paper, which is important for the diagnosis and treatment of
ischemic stroke. First, a background classifier based on MobileNetV3 segments
big whole-slide digital pathology images into numerous tiles to detect the
presence of cellular material. After that, different pre-trained image
classification algorithms are fine-tuned to determine the origin of blood
clots. Due to complex blood flow dynamics and limitations in conventional
imaging methods such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), and ultrasound, identifying the sources of blood clots is a challenging
task. Although these techniques are useful for identifying blood clots, they
are not very good at determining how they originated. To address these
challenges, our method makes use of robust computer vision models that have
been refined using information from whole-slide digital pathology images. Out
of all the models tested, the PoolFormer \cite{yu2022metaformer} performs
better than the others, with 93.4\% accuracy, 93.4\% precision, 93.4\% recall,
and 93.4\% F1-score. Moreover, it achieves the good weighted multi-class
logarithmic loss (WMCLL) of 0.4361, which emphasizes how effective it is in
this particular application. These encouraging findings suggest that our
approach can successfully identify the origin of blood clots in a variety of
vascular locations, potentially advancing ischemic stroke diagnosis and
treatment approaches.",Koushik Sivarama Krishnan; P. J.

User Engagement and the Toxicity of Tweets,"Twitter is one of the most popular online micro-blogging and social
networking platforms. This platform allows individuals to freely express
opinions and interact with others regardless of geographic barriers. However,
with the good that online platforms offer, also comes the bad. Twitter and
other social networking platforms have created new spaces for incivility. With
the growing interest on the consequences of uncivil behavior online,
understanding how a toxic comment impacts online interactions is imperative. We
analyze a random sample of more than 85,300 Twitter conversations to examine
differences between toxic and non-toxic conversations and the relationship
between toxicity and user engagement. We find that toxic conversations, those
with at least one toxic tweet, are longer but have fewer individual users
contributing to the dialogue compared to the non-toxic conversations. However,
within toxic conversations, toxicity is positively associated with more
individual Twitter users participating in conversations. This suggests that
overall, more visible conversations are more likely to include toxic replies.
  Additionally, we examine the sequencing of toxic tweets and its impact on
conversations. Toxic tweets often occur as the main tweet or as the first
reply, and lead to greater overall conversation toxicity. We also find a
relationship between the toxicity of the first reply to a toxic tweet and the
toxicity of the conversation, such that whether the first reply is toxic or
non-toxic sets the stage for the overall toxicity of the conversation,
following the idea that hate can beget hate.",Nazanin Salehabadi; Anne Groggel; Mohit Singhal; Sayak Saha Roy; Shirin Nilizadeh,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03856v1,False,True,False,False,False,1359.0,Alesha Istvan,Texas,Completed,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2211.03856,"Conversation, Toxicity, Social media, Internet privacy, World Wide Web, Psychology, Computer science, Communication, Medicine, Internal medicine",,,
Understanding the Bystander Effect on Toxic Twitter Conversations,"In this study, we explore the power of group dynamics to shape the toxicity
of Twitter conversations. First, we examine how the presence of others in a
conversation can potentially diffuse Twitter users' responsibility to address a
toxic direct reply. Second, we examine whether the toxicity of the first direct
reply to a toxic tweet in conversations establishes the group norms for
subsequent replies. By doing so, we outline how bystanders and the tone of
initial responses to a toxic reply are explanatory factors which affect whether
others feel uninhibited to post their own abusive or derogatory replies. We
test this premise by analyzing a random sample of more than 156k tweets
belonging to ~9k conversations. Central to this work is the social
psychological research on the ""bystander effect"" documenting that the presence
of bystanders has the power to alter the dynamics of a social situation. If the
first direct reply reaffirms the divisive tone, other replies may follow suit.
We find evidence of a bystander effect, with our results showing that an
increased number of users participating in the conversation before receiving a
toxic tweet is negatively associated with the number of Twitter users who
responded to the toxic reply in a non-toxic way. We also find that the initial
responses to toxic tweets within conversations is of great importance. Posting
a toxic reply immediately after a toxic comment is negatively associated with
users posting non-toxic replies and Twitter conversations becoming increasingly
toxic.",Ana Aleksandric; Mohit Singhal; Anne Groggel; Shirin Nilizadeh,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10764v1,False,True,False,False,False,1359.0,Alesha Istvan,Texas,Completed,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2211.10764,"Bystander effect, Conversation, Tone (literature), Premise, Psychology, Social psychology, Social media, Affect (linguistics), Power (physics), Explanatory power, Computer science, Communication, World Wide Web, Epistemology, Art, Philosophy, Physics, Literature, Quantum mechanics",,,
Equity in the Distribution of Regulatory PM2.5 Monitors,"Unequal exposure to air pollution by race and socioeconomic status is
well-documented in the U.S. However, there has been relatively little research
on inequities in the collection of PM2.5 data, creating a critical gap in
understanding which neighborhood exposures are represented in these datasets.
In this study we use multilevel models with random intercepts by county and
state, stratified by urbanicity to investigate the association between six key
environmental justice (EJ) attributes (%AIAN, %Asian %Black, %Hispanic, %White,
%Poverty) and proximity to the nearest regulatory monitor at the census
tract-level across the contiguous 48 states. We also separately stratify our
models by EPA region. Our results show that most EJ attributes exhibit weak or
statistically insignificant associations with monitor proximity, except in
rural areas where higher poverty levels are significantly linked to greater
monitor distances ($\beta$ = 0.6, 95%CI = [0.49, 0.71]). While the US EPA's
siting criteria may be effective in ensuring equitable monitor distribution in
some contexts, the low density of monitors in rural areas may impact the

"Global Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on the Atmospheric Concentrations
  of Nitrogen Dioxide and Ozone","Social-distancing to combat the COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread
reductions in air pollutant emissions. Quantifying these changes requires a
business as usual counterfactual that accounts for the synoptic and seasonal
variability of air pollutants. We use a machine learning algorithm driven by
information from the NASA GEOS-CF model to assess changes in nitrogen dioxide
(NO$_{2}$) and ozone (O$_{3}$) at 5,756 observation sites in 46 countries from
January through June 2020. Reductions in NO$_{2}$ correlate with timing and
intensity of COVID-19 restrictions, ranging from 60% in severely affected
cities (e.g., Wuhan, Milan) to little change (e.g., Rio de Janeiro, Taipei). On
average, NO$_{2}$ concentrations were 18% lower than business as usual from
February 2020 onward. China experienced the earliest and steepest decline, but
concentrations since April have mostly recovered and remained within 5% to the
business as usual estimate. NO$_{2}$ reductions in Europe and the US have been
more gradual with a halting recovery starting in late March. We estimate that
the global NO$_{x}$ (NO+NO$_{2}$) emission reduction during the first 6 months
of 2020 amounted to 2.9 TgN, equivalent to 5.1% of the annual anthropogenic
total. The response of surface O$_{3}$ is complicated by competing influences
of non-linear atmospheric chemistry. While surface O$_{3}$ increased by up to
50% in some locations, we find the overall net impact on daily average O$_{3}$
between February - June 2020 to be small. However, our analysis indicates a
flattening of the O$_{3}$ diurnal cycle with an increase in night time ozone
due to reduced titration and a decrease in daytime ozone, reflecting a
reduction in photochemical production. The O$_{3}$ response is dependent on
season, time scale, and environment, with declines in surface O$_{3}$
forecasted if NO$_{x}$ emission reductions continue.",Christoph A. Keller; Mat. J. Evans; K. Emma Knowland; Christa A. Hasenkopf; Sruti Modekurty; Robert A. Lucchesi; Tomohiro Oda; Bruno B.

this quasi-density, we develop a rejection sampling procedure that adaptively

police can only count and describe the crimes that come to their attention. To
address this, our study combines information from police-based residential

novel large-scale macroeconometric model, we shed light on regional disparities
of inequality responses to a national uncertainty shock. The results suggest
that income inequality decreases in most states, with a pronounced degree of
heterogeneity in terms of shapes and magnitudes of the dynamic responses. By
contrast, some few states, mostly located in the West and South census region,
display increasing levels of income inequality over time. We find that this
directional pattern in responses is mainly driven by the income composition and
labor market fundamentals. In addition, forecast error variance decompositions
allow for a quantitative assessment of the importance of uncertainty shocks in
explaining income inequality. The findings highlight that volatility shocks
account for a considerable fraction of forecast error variance for most states
considered. Finally, a regression-based analysis sheds light on the driving
forces behind differences in state-specific inequality responses.",Manfred M.

"Lady and the Tramp Nextdoor: Online Manifestations of Economic
  Inequalities in the Nextdoor Social Network","From health to education, income impacts a huge range of life choices.
Earlier research has leveraged data from online social networks to study
precisely this impact. In this paper, we ask the opposite question: do
different levels of income result in different online behaviors? We demonstrate
it does. We present the first large-scale study of Nextdoor, a popular
location-based social network. We collect 2.6 Million posts from 64,283
neighborhoods in the United States and 3,325 neighborhoods in the United
Kingdom, to examine whether online discourse reflects the income and income
inequality of a neighborhood. We show that posts from neighborhoods with
different incomes indeed differ, e.g. richer neighborhoods have a more positive
sentiment and discuss crimes more, even though their actual crime rates are
much lower. We then show that user-generated content can predict both income
and inequality. We train multiple machine learning models and predict both
income (R-squared=0.841) and inequality (R-squared=0.77).",Waleed Iqbal; Vahid Ghafouri; Gareth Tyson; Guillermo Suarez-Tangil; Ignacio Castro,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05232v2,False,True,False,False,False,1403.0,Marina Gindelsky,Washington,Completed,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2304.05232,"Inequality, Economic inequality, Scale (ratio), Demographic economics, Sociology, Economics, Geography, Mathematics, Mathematical analysis, Cartography",,,
Mechanical Model of Personal Income Distribution,"A microeconomic model is developed, which accurately predicts the shape of
personal income distribution (PID) in the United States and the evolution of
the shape over time. The underlying concept is borrowed from geo-mechanics and

the resolution of empirical and definitional problems associated with personal
income measurements. It also serves as a firm fundament for definitions of
income inequality as secondary derivatives from personal income distribution.

"XGBoost Learning of Dynamic Wager Placement for In-Play Betting on an
  Agent-Based Model of a Sports Betting Exchange","We present first results from the use of XGBoost, a highly effective machine
learning (ML) method, within the Bristol Betting Exchange (BBE), an open-source
agent-based model (ABM) designed to simulate a contemporary sports-betting
exchange with in-play betting during track-racing events such as horse races.
We use the BBE ABM and its array of minimally-simple bettor-agents as a
synthetic data generator which feeds into our XGBoost ML system, with the
intention that XGBoost discovers profitable dynamic betting strategies by
learning from the more profitable bets made by the BBE bettor-agents. After
this XGBoost training, which results in one or more decision trees, a
bettor-agent with a betting strategy determined by the XGBoost-learned decision
tree(s) is added to the BBE ABM and made to bet on a sequence of races under
various conditions and betting-market scenarios, with profitability serving as
the primary metric of comparison and evaluation. Our initial findings presented
here show that XGBoost trained in this way can indeed learn profitable betting
strategies, and can generalise to learn strategies that outperform each of the
set of strategies used for creation of the training data. To foster further
research and enhancements, the complete version of our extended BBE, including
the XGBoost integration, has been made freely available as an open-source

"Firm dynamics in a closed, conserved economy: A model of size
  distribution of employment and related statistics","We address the issue of the distribution of firm size. To this end we propose
a model of firms in a closed, conserved economy populated with
zero-intelligence agents who continuously move from one firm to another. We
then analyze the size distribution and related statistics obtained from the
model. Our ultimate goal is to reproduce the well known statistical features
obtained from the panel study of the firms i.e., the power law in size (in
terms of income and/or employment), the Laplace distribution in the growth
rates and the slowly declining standard deviation of the growth rates
conditional on the firm size. First, we show that the model generalizes the
usual kinetic exchange models with binary interaction to interactions between
an arbitrary number of agents. When the number of interacting agents is in the
order of the system itself, it is possible to decouple the model. We provide
some exact results on the distributions. Our model easily reproduces the power
law. The fluctuations in the growth rate falls with increasing size following a
power law (with an exponent 1 whereas the data suggests that the exponent is
around 1/6). However, the distribution of the difference of the firm-size in
this model has Laplace distribution whereas the real data suggests that the
difference of the log sizes has the same distribution.",Anindya S.

"Cognitive Endurance, Talent Selection, and the Labor Market Returns to
  Human Capital","Cognitive endurance -- the ability to sustain performance on a
cognitively-demanding task over time -- is thought to be a crucial productivity
determinant. However, a lack of data on this variable has limited researchers'
ability to understand its role for success in college and the labor market.
This paper uses college-admission-exam records from 15 million Brazilian high
school students to measure cognitive endurance based on changes in performance
throughout the exam. By exploiting exogenous variation in the order of exam
questions, I show that students are 7.1 percentage points more likely to
correctly answer a given question when it appears at the beginning of the day
versus the end (relative to a sample mean of 34.3%). I develop a method to
decompose test scores into fatigue-adjusted ability and cognitive endurance. I
then merge these measures into a higher-education census and the earnings
records of the universe of Brazilian formal-sector workers to quantify the
association between endurance and long-run outcomes. I find that cognitive
endurance has a statistically and economically significant wage return.
Controlling for fatigue-adjusted ability and other student characteristics, a
one-standard-deviation higher endurance predicts a 5.4% wage increase. This
wage return to endurance is sizable, equivalent to a third of the wage return
to ability. I also document positive associations between endurance and college
attendance, college quality, college graduation, firm quality, and other
outcomes. Finally, I show how systematic differences in endurance across
students interact with the exam design to determine the sorting of students to
colleges. I discuss the implications of these findings for the use of cognitive
assessments for talent selection and investments in interventions that build
cognitive endurance.",Germán Reyes,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02575v1,False,True,False,False,False,1449.0,Erica Palmer,Texas,Completed,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2301.02575,"Wage, Human capital, Earnings, Cognition, Endurance training, Psychology, Demographic economics, Labour economics, Economics, Medicine, Finance, Physical therapy, Neuroscience, Economic growth",,,
"When invariants matter: The role of I1 and I2 in neural network models
  of incompressible hyperelasticity","For the formulation of machine learning-based material models, the usage of
invariants of deformation tensors is attractive, since this can a priori
guarantee objectivity and material symmetry. In this work, we consider
incompressible, isotropic hyperelasticity, where two invariants I1 and I2 are
required for depicting a deformation state. First, we aim at enhancing the
understanding of the invariants. We provide an explicit representation of the
set of invariants that are admissible, i.e. for which (I1, I2) a deformation
state does indeed exist. Furthermore, we prove that uniaxial and equi-biaxial
deformation correspond to the boundary of the set of admissible invariants.
Second, we study how the experimentally-observed behaviour of different
materials can be captured by means of neural network models of incompressible
hyperelasticity, depending on whether both I1 and I2 or solely one of the
invariants, i.e. either only I1 or only I2, are taken into account. To this
end, we investigate three different experimental data sets from the literature.
In particular, we demonstrate that considering only one invariant, either I1 or
I2, can allow for good agreement with experiments in case of small
deformations. In contrast, it is necessary to consider both invariants for
precise models at large strains, for instance when rubbery polymers are
deformed. Moreover, we show that multiaxial experiments are strictly required
for the parameterisation of models considering I2. Otherwise, if only data from
uniaxial deformation is available, significantly overly stiff responses could
be predicted for general deformation states. On the contrary, I1-only models
can make qualitatively correct predictions for multiaxial loadings even if
parameterised only from uniaxial data, whereas I2-only models are completely
incapable in even qualitatively capturing experimental stress data at large
deformations.",Franz Dammaß; Karl A.

Sustained Online Amplification of COVID-19 Elites in the United States,"The ongoing, fluid nature of the COVID-19 pandemic requires individuals to
regularly seek information about best health practices, local community
spreading, and public health guidelines. In the absence of a unified response
to the pandemic in the United States and clear, consistent directives from
federal and local officials, people have used social media to collectively
crowdsource COVID-19 elites, a small set of trusted COVID-19 information
sources. We take a census of COVID-19 crowdsourced elites in the United States
who have received sustained attention on Twitter during the pandemic. Using a
mixed methods approach with a panel of Twitter users linked to public U.S.
voter registration records, we find that journalists, media outlets, and
political accounts have been consistently amplified around COVID-19, while
epidemiologists, public health officials, and medical professionals make up
only a small portion of all COVID-19 elites on Twitter. We show that COVID-19
elites vary considerably across demographic groups, and that there are notable
racial, geographic, and political similarities and disparities between various
groups and the demographics of their elites. With this variation in mind, we
discuss the potential for using the disproportionate online voice of
crowdsourced COVID-19 elites to equitably promote timely public health

  Chains","I study the role of industries' position in supply chains in shaping the

destination-specific final demand shocks and destination exposure shares to
show that shocks amplify upstream. Quantitatively, upstream industries respond
to final demand shocks up to three times as much as final goods producers, in
line with the bullwhip effect. To organize the reduced form results, I develop
a tractable production network model with inventories and study how the
properties of the network and the cyclicality of inventories interact to
determine whether final demand shocks amplify or dissipate upstream. I test the
mechanism by directly estimating the model-implied relationship between output
growth and demand shocks, mediated by network position and inventories. I find
evidence of the role of inventories in explaining heterogeneous output
elasticities. Finally, I use the model to quantitatively study how inventories

"Do Black and Indigenous Communities Receive their Fair Share of Vaccines
  Under the 2018 CDC Guidelines","A major focus of debate about rationing guidelines for COVID-19 vaccines is
whether and how to prioritize access for minority populations that have been
particularly affected by the pandemic, and been the subject of historical and
structural disadvantage, particularly Black and Indigenous individuals. We
simulate the 2018 CDC Vaccine Allocation guidelines using data from the
American Community Survey under different assumptions on total vaccine supply.
Black and Indigenous individuals combined receive a higher share of vaccines
compared to their population share for all assumptions on total vaccine supply.
However, their vaccine share under the 2018 CDC guidelines is considerably
lower than their share of COVID-19 deaths and age-adjusted deaths. We then
simulate one method to incorporate disadvantage in vaccine allocation via a
reserve system. In a reserve system, units are placed into categories and units
reserved for a category give preferential treatment to individuals from that
category. Using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) as a proxy for disadvantage,
we show that a 40% high-ADI reserve increases the number of vaccines allocated
to Black or Indigenous individuals, with a share that approaches their COVID-19
death share when there are about 75 million units. Our findings illustrate that
whether an allocation is equitable depends crucially on the benchmark and
highlight the importance of considering the expected distribution of outcomes
from implementing vaccine allocation guidelines.",Parag A. Pathak; Harald Schmidt; Adam Solomon; Edwin Song; Tayfun Sönmez; M.

"The price elasticity of Gleevec in patients with Chronic Myeloid
  Leukemia enrolled in Medicare Part D: Evidence from a regression
  discontinuity design","Objective To assess the price elasticity of branded imatinib in chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML) patients on Medicare Part D to determine if high
out-of-pocket payments (OOP) are driving the substantial levels of
non-adherence observed in this population.
  Data sources and study setting We use data from the TriNetX Diamond Network
(TDN) United States database for the period from first availability in 2011
through the end of patent exclusivity following the introduction of generic
imatinib in early 2016.
  Study design We implement a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to
separately estimate the effect of Medicare Part D enrollment at age 65 on
adherence and OOP in newly-diagnosed CML patients initiating branded imatinib.
The corresponding price elasticity of demand (PED) is estimated and results are
assessed across a variety of specifications and robustness checks.
  Data collection/extraction methods Data from eligible patients following the
application of inclusion and exclusion criteria were analyzed.
  Principal findings Our analysis suggests that there is a significant increase
in initial OOP of $232 (95% Confidence interval (CI): $102 to $362) for
individuals that enrolled in Part D due to expanded eligibility at age 65. The
relatively smaller and non-significant decrease in adherence of only 6
percentage points (95% CI: -0.21 to 0.08) led to a PED of -0.02 (95% CI:
-0.056, 0.015).
  Conclusion This study provides evidence regarding the financial impact of
coinsurance-based benefit designs on Medicare-age patients with CML initiating
branded imatinib. Results indicate that factors besides high OOP are driving
the substantial non-adherence observed in this population and add to the
growing literature on PED for specialty drugs.",Samantha E.

"Conclusions from a NAIVE Bayes Operator Predicting the Medicare 2011
  Transaction Data Set","Introduction: The United States Federal Government operates one of the worlds
largest medical insurance programs, Medicare, to ensure payment for clinical
services for the elderly, illegal aliens and those without the ability to pay
for their care directly. This paper evaluates the Medicare 2011 Transaction
Data Set which details the transfer of funds from Medicare to private and
public clinical care facilities for specific clinical services for the
operational year 2011. Methods: Data mining was conducted to establish the
relationships between reported and computed transaction values in the data set
to better understand the drivers of Medicare transactions at a programmatic
level. Results: The models averaged 88 for average model accuracy and 38 for
average Kappa during training. Some reported classes are highly independent
from the available data as their predictability remains stable regardless of
redaction of supporting and contradictory evidence. DRG or procedure type
appears to be unpredictable from the available financial transaction values.
Conclusions: Overlay hypotheses such as charges being driven by the volume
served or DRG being related to charges or payments is readily false in this
analysis despite 28 million Americans being billed through Medicare in 2011 and
the program distributing over 70 billion in this transaction set alone. It may
be impossible to predict the dependencies and data structures the payer of last
resort without data from payers of first and second resort. Political concerns
about Medicare would be better served focusing on these first and second order

a window of opportunity for the development of the domestic agricultural

"(Unintended) Consequences of export restrictions on medical goods during

posed by the Covid-19 pandemic by restricting their export of medical supplies.
Such measures are meant to increase the domestic availability of critical
goods, and are commonly used in times of crisis. Yet, not much is known about
their impact, especially on countries imposing them. Here we show that export
bans are, by and large, counterproductive. Using a model of shock diffusion
through the network of international trade, we simulate the impact of
restrictions under different scenarios. We observe that while they would be
beneficial to a country implementing them in isolation, their generalized use
makes most countries worse off relative to a no-ban scenario. As a corollary,
we estimate that prices increase in many countries imposing the restrictions.
We also find that the cost of restraining from export bans is small, even when
others continue to implement them. Finally, we document a change in countries'
position within the international trade network, suggesting that export bans
have geopolitical implications.",Marco Grassia; Giuseppe Mangioni; Stefano Schiavo; Silvio Traverso,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11941v1,False,True,False,False,False,1518.0,Sharat Ganapati,Georgetown,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1093/comnet/cnab045,"Pandemic, Position (finance), Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Unintended consequences, Shock (circulatory), Business, Corollary, International trade, Geopolitics, International economics, Economics, Political science, Mathematics, Finance, Politics, Pure mathematics, Internal medicine, Medicine, Disease, Pathology, Infectious disease (medical specialty), Law",University of Catania; University of Trento; University of Genoa,"Dip.

"FlexLLM: A System for Co-Serving Large Language Model Inference and
  Parameter-Efficient Finetuning","Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) is a widely used technique to adapt
large language models for different tasks. Service providers typically create
separate systems for users to perform PEFT model finetuning and inference
tasks. This is because existing systems cannot handle workloads that include a
mix of inference and PEFT finetuning requests. As a result, shared GPU
resources are underutilized, leading to inefficiencies. To address this
problem, we present FlexLLM, the first system that can serve inference and
parameter-efficient finetuning requests in the same iteration. Our system
leverages the complementary nature of these two tasks and utilizes shared GPU
resources to run them jointly, using a method called co-serving. To achieve
this, FlexLLM introduces a novel token-level finetuning mechanism, which breaks
down the finetuning computation of a sequence into smaller token-level
computations and uses dependent parallelization and graph pruning, two static
compilation optimizations, to minimize the memory overhead and latency for
co-serving. Compared to existing systems, FlexLLM's co-serving approach reduces
the activation GPU memory overhead by up to 8x, and the end-to-end GPU memory
requirement of finetuning by up to 36% while maintaining a low inference
latency and improving finetuning throughput. For example, under a heavy
inference workload, FlexLLM can still preserve more than 80% of the peak
finetuning throughput, whereas existing systems cannot make any progress with
finetuning. The source code of FlexLLM is publicly available at

Transaction Cost Analytics for Corporate Bonds,"The electronic platform has been increasingly popular for executing large
corporate bond orders by asset managers, who in turn have to assess the quality
of their executions via Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA). One of the challenges
in TCA is to build a realistic benchmark for the expected transaction cost and
to characterize the price impact of each individual trade with given bond
characteristics and market conditions.
  Taking the viewpoint of retail investors, this paper presents an analytical
methodology for TCA of corporate bond trading. Our analysis is based on the
TRACE Enhanced dataset; and starts with estimating the initiator of a bond
transaction, followed by estimating the bid-ask spread and the mid-price
dynamics. With these estimations, the first part of our study is to identify
key features for corporate bonds and to compute the expected average trading
cost. This part is on the time scale of weekly transactions, and is by applying
and comparing several regularized regression models. The second part of our
study is using the estimated mid-price dynamics to investigate the amplitude of
its price impact and the decay pattern of individual bond transaction. This
part is on the time scale of each transaction of liquid corporate bonds, and is
by applying a transient impact model to estimate the price impact kernel using
a non-parametric method.
  Our benchmark model allows for identifying abnormal transactions and for
enhancing counter-party selections. A key discovery of our study is the price
impact asymmetry between customer-buy orders and consumer-sell orders.",Xin Guo; Charles-Albert Lehalle; Renyuan Xu,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09140v4,False,True,False,False,False,1528.0,Youngsuk Yook,Fed Board,Completed,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.1080/14697688.2022.2054723,"Corporate bond, Bond, Transaction cost, Price discovery, Database transaction, Benchmark (surveying), Transaction data, Computer science, Econometrics, Business, Financial economics, Economics, Futures contract, Finance, Database, Geodesy, Geography","University of Southern California; University of Oxford; University of California, Berkeley; Imperial College London","Epstein Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Southern California Los Angeles, CA, USA; Imperial College London, London, UK; Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA; Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK; Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","Epstein Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Southern California Los Angeles, CA, USA; Imperial College London, London, UK; Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA; Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK; Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"
"Liquidity Stress Testing in Asset Management -- Part 2. Modeling the
  Asset Liquidity Risk","This article is part of a comprehensive research project on liquidity risk in
asset management, which can be divided into three dimensions. The first
dimension covers liability liquidity risk (or funding liquidity) modeling, the
second dimension focuses on asset liquidity risk (or market liquidity)
modeling, and the third dimension considers the asset-liability management of
the liquidity gap risk (or asset-liability matching). The purpose of this
research is to propose a methodological and practical framework in order to
perform liquidity stress testing programs, which comply with regulatory
guidelines (ESMA, 2019, 2020) and are useful for fund managers. The review of
the academic literature and professional research studies shows that there is a
lack of standardized and analytical models. The aim of this research project is
then to fill the gap with the goal of developing mathematical and statistical
approaches, and providing appropriate answers.
  In this second article focused on asset liquidity risk modeling, we propose a
market impact model to estimate transaction costs. After presenting a toy model
that helps to understand the main concepts of asset liquidity, we consider a
two-regime model, which is based on the power-law property of price impact.
Then, we define several asset liquidity measures such as liquidity cost,
liquidation ratio and shortfall or time to liquidation in order to assess the
different dimensions of asset liquidity. Finally, we apply this asset liquidity
framework to stocks and bonds and discuss the issues of calibrating the
transaction cost model.",Thierry Roncalli; Amina Cherief; Fatma Karray-Meziou; Margaux Regnault,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08377v1,False,True,False,False,False,1528.0,Youngsuk Yook,Fed Board,Completed,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3849496,"Liquidity risk, Market liquidity, Business, Asset (computer security), Stress testing (software), Consumption-based capital asset pricing model, Asset management, Capital asset pricing model, Financial system, Finance, Computer science, Computer security, Programming language",Université d'Évry Val-d'Essonne; Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques; École Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Économique,Amundi Asset Management; National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) - National School for Statistical and Economic Administration (ENSAE); University of Evry,Amundi Asset Management; National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) - National School for Statistical and Economic Administration (ENSAE); University of Evry

measurement tools, management tools and monitoring tools. In terms of
measurement tools, we focus on the computation of the redemption coverage ratio
(RCR), which is the central instrument of liquidity stress testing programs. We
also study the redemption liquidation policy and the different implementation
methodologies, and we show how reverse stress testing can be developed. In
terms of liquidity management tools, we study the calibration of liquidity
buffers, the pros and cons of special arrangements (redemption suspensions,

Bertrand oligopoly in insurance markets with Value at Risk Constraints,"Since 2016 the operation of insurance companies in the European Union is
regulated by the Solvency II directive. According to the EU directive the
capital requirement should be calculated as a 99.5\% of Value at Risk. In this

equilibrium premiums and capitals. We discuss the case of the oligopoly
insurance market using Bertrand's model, assuming profit maximizing insurance
companies facing Value at Risk constraints. First we analyze companies'
decision on premium level. The companies strategic behavior can result positive
as well as negative expected profit for companies. The desired situation where
competition eliminate positive profit and lead the market to zero-profit state
is rare. Later we examine ex post and ax ante capital adjustments. Capital
adjustment does not rule out market anomalies, although somehow changes them.
Possibility of capital adjustment can lead the market to a situation where all

Recognizing crime types as components of a whole, we employ CoDA to explore

countries based on their crime profiles, identifying three distinct clusters
largely aligning with geographical locations. This clustering is visualized
through t-SNE and geographic mapping, revealing regional similarities. Further
analysis using Robust Principal Component Analysis on identified crime clusters
reveals insightful relationships between specific crime types, such as
homicide, smuggling, and financial crimes, and how their prevalence varies
across countries. The findings reveals distinct crime patterns across Europe,
highlighting regional commonalities while also highlighting divergences like
Norway and Latvia that deviate from their expected geographical
classifications. Moreover, the study identifies specific crime groups; for
example, it pairs countries high in corruption and smuggling, such as Austria,
with those countries that exhibit a higher relevance to homicide and smuggling,
such as Luxembourg. It also points to the presence of financial crimes like

A Benchmark for Crime Surveillance Video Analysis with Large Models,"Anomaly analysis in surveillance videos is a crucial topic in computer
vision. In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
outperformed task-specific models in various domains. Although MLLMs are
particularly versatile, their abilities to understand anomalous concepts and

field not providing MLLM-style QAs and efficient algorithms to assess the

crime surveillance video analysis with large models denoted as UCVL, including
1,829 videos and reorganized annotations from the UCF-Crime and UCF-Crime
Annotation datasets. We design six types of questions and generate diverse QA
pairs. Then we develop detailed instructions and use OpenAI's GPT-4o for
accurate assessment. We benchmark eight prevailing MLLMs ranging from 0.5B to
40B parameters, and the results demonstrate the reliability of this bench.

"Extinction dynamics from meta-stable coexistences in an evolutionary

different types. Stochasticity, however, drives the loss of such coexistences.
This extinction is usually accompanied by population size fluctuations. We
investigate the most probable extinction trajectory under such fluctuations by
mapping a stochastic evolutionary model to a problem of classical mechanics
using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. Our results show that
more abundant types in a coexistence can be more likely to go extinct first

hottest skills needed in the field. The article introduces a new method for
analyzing job advertisements using social network analysis to identify the most
critical skills required by employers in the market. In this research, to form
the communication network of skills, first 5763 skills were collected from the
LinkedIn social network, then the relationship between skills was collected and
searched in 7777 computer science job advertisements, and finally, the balanced
communication network of skills was formed. The study analyzes the formed
communication network of skills in the computer science job market and
identifies four distinct communities of skills: Generalists, Infrastructure and

employers value both hard and soft skills, such as programming languages and
teamwork. Communication skills were found to be the most important skill in the
labor market. Additionally, certain skills were highlighted based on their
centrality indices, including communication, English, SQL, Git, and business

"Machine-learning classifiers for logographic name matching in public
  health applications: approaches for incorporating phonetic, visual, and
  keystroke similarity in large-scale probabilistic record linkage","Approximate string-matching methods to account for complex variation in
highly discriminatory text fields, such as personal names, can enhance
probabilistic record linkage. However, discriminating between matching and
non-matching strings is challenging for logographic scripts, where similarities
in pronunciation, appearance, or keystroke sequence are not directly encoded in
the string data. We leverage a large Chinese administrative dataset with known
match status to develop logistic regression and Xgboost classifiers integrating
measures of visual, phonetic, and keystroke similarity to enhance
identification of potentially-matching name pairs. We evaluate three methods of
leveraging name similarity scores in large-scale probabilistic record linkage,
which can adapt to varying match prevalence and information in supporting
fields: (1) setting a threshold score based on predicted quality of
name-matching across all record pairs; (2) setting a threshold score based on
predicted discriminatory power of the linkage model; and (3) using empirical
score distributions among matches and nonmatches to perform Bayesian adjustment
of matching probabilities estimated from exact-agreement linkage. In
experiments on holdout data, as well as data simulated with varying name error
rates and supporting fields, a logistic regression classifier incorporated via
the Bayesian method demonstrated marked improvements over exact-agreement
linkage with respect to discriminatory power, match probability estimation, and
accuracy, reducing the total number of misclassified record pairs by 21% in
test data and up to an average of 93% in simulated datasets. Our results
demonstrate the value of incorporating visual, phonetic, and keystroke
similarity for logographic name matching, as well as the promise of our
Bayesian approach to leverage name-matching within large-scale record linkage.",Philip A. Collender; Zhiyue Tom Hu; Charles Li; Qu Cheng; Xintong Li; Yue You; Song Liang; Changhong Yang; Justin V.

Resource Allocation for 5G-UAV Based Emergency Wireless Communications,"For unforeseen natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and
floods, etc., the traditional communication infrastructure is unavailable or
seriously disrupted along with persistent secondary disasters. Under such
circumstances, it is highly demanded to deploy emergency wireless communication
(EWC) networks to restore connectivity in accident/incident areas. The emerging
fifth-generation (5G)/beyond-5G (B5G) wireless communication system, like
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted networks and intelligent reflecting
surface (IRS) based communication systems, are expected to be designed or
re-farmed for supporting temporary high quality communications in post-disaster
areas. However, the channel characteristics of post-disaster areas quickly
change as the secondary disaster resulted topographical changes, imposing new
but critical challenges for EWC networks. In this paper, we propose a novel
heterogeneous $\mathcal{F}$ composite fading channel model for EWC networks
which accurately models and characterizes the composite fading channel with
reflectors, path-loss exponent, fading, and shadowing parameters in 5G-UAV
based EWC networks. Based on the model, we develop the optimal power allocation
scheme with the simple closed-form expression and the numerical results based
optimal joint bandwidth-power allocation scheme. We derive the corresponding
capacities and compare the energy efficiency between IRS and traditional relay
based 5G-UAVs. Numerical results show that the new heterogeneous
Fisher-Snedecor $\mathcal{F}$ composite fading channel adapted resource
allocation schemes can achieve higher capacity and energy efficiency than those
of traditional channel model adapted resource allocation schemes, thus
providing better communications service for post-disaster areas.",Zhuohui Yao; Wenchi Cheng; Wei Zhang; Hailin Zhang,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17094v1,False,True,False,False,False,1652.0,Ishuwar Seetharam,Stanford,Completed,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1109/jsac.2021.3088684,"Fading, Computer science, Wireless, Channel (broadcasting), Wireless network, Computer network, Resource allocation, Telecommunications, Topology (electrical circuits), Engineering, Electrical engineering",UNSW Sydney; Xidian University,"School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xian, China","School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xian, China"

Second, probabilistic frameworks are fundamentally restricted by their
underlying assumption of hazard independence, which directly contradicts the
observed reality of cascading and compound disasters. By relying on fixed
expert parameters and treating hazards as independent phenomena, these models
dangerously misrepresent the true risk landscape. This work addresses this
challenge by developing the Multi-Hazard Bayesian Hierarchical Model (MH-BHM),
which reconceptualizes the classical risk equation beyond its deterministic
origins. The model's core theoretical contribution lies in reformulating a
classical risk formula as a fully probabilistic model that naturally
accommodates hazard interactions through its hierarchical structure while
preserving the traditional hazard-exposure-vulnerability framework. Using
tropical cyclone damage data (1952-2020) from the Philippines as a test case,
with out-of-sample validation on recent events (2020-2022), the model
demonstrates significant empirical advantages. Key findings include a reduction
in damage prediction error by 61% compared to a single-hazard model, and 80%
compared to a benchmark deterministic model. This corresponds to an improvement
in damage estimation accuracy of USD 0.8 billion and USD 2 billion,
respectively. The improved accuracy enables more effective disaster risk
management across multiple domains, from optimized insurance pricing and
national resource allocation to local adaptation strategies, fundamentally
improving society's capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters.",Mary Lai O.

The evolution of the game of baccarat,"The game of baccarat has evolved from a parlor game played by French
aristocrats in the first half of the 19th century to a casino game that
generated over US\$41 billion in revenue for the casinos of Macau in 2013. The
parlor game was originally a three-person zero-sum game. Later in the 19th
century it was simplified to a two-person zero-sum game. Early in the 20th
century the parlor game became a casino game, no longer zero-sum. In the mid
20th century, the strategic casino game became a nonstrategic game, with
players competing against the house instead of against each other. We argue
that this evolution was motivated by both economic and game-theoretic
considerations.",S. N.

  The STAGE Lab Quantum Casino provides an entertaining and approachable
experience for people of all ages to become familiar with quantum physics. By
using core concepts of quantum physics as tools and strategies to overcome
challenges that arise in gameplay, players gain an intuitive understanding of
these concepts. These games provide players with a first-hand experience of the
following quantum physics concepts: measurement, superposition, encryption,
decoherence, and entanglement. Instead of teaching the concepts through a
traditional classroom pedagogy, these games aim to invoke curiosity, spark
moments of playfulness, and catalyze play-centric learning modalities. This

"Dynamic Fraud Detection: Integrating Reinforcement Learning into Graph
  Neural Networks","Financial fraud refers to the act of obtaining financial benefits through
dishonest means. Such behavior not only disrupts the order of the financial
market but also harms economic and social development and breeds other illegal
and criminal activities. With the popularization of the internet and online
payment methods, many fraudulent activities and money laundering behaviors in
life have shifted from offline to online, posing a great challenge to
regulatory authorities. How to efficiently detect these financial fraud
activities has become an urgent issue that needs to be resolved. Graph neural
networks are a type of deep learning model that can utilize the interactive
relationships within graph structures, and they have been widely applied in the
field of fraud detection. However, there are still some issues. First,
fraudulent activities only account for a very small part of transaction
transfers, leading to an inevitable problem of label imbalance in fraud
detection. At the same time, fraudsters often disguise their behavior, which
can have a negative impact on the final prediction results. In addition,
existing research has overlooked the importance of balancing neighbor
information and central node information. For example, when the central node
has too many neighbors, the features of the central node itself are often
neglected. Finally, fraud activities and patterns are constantly changing over
time, so considering the dynamic evolution of graph edge relationships is also
very important.",Yuxin Dong; Jianhua Yao; Jiajing Wang; Yingbin Liang; Shuhan Liao; Minheng Xiao,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09892v1,False,True,False,False,False,1668.0,Jung Ho Choi,Stanford,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1109/docs63458.2024.10704268,"Reinforcement learning, Computer science, Artificial intelligence, Graph, Artificial neural network, Machine learning, Theoretical computer science",University of Utah; Seattle University; Columbia University; Phoenix (United States); Wake Forest University; Northeastern University; The Ohio State University; Trine University,"Ohio State University,Columbus,USA; Northeastern University,Seattle,USA; Columbia University,New York,USA; University of Utah,Salt Lake City,USA; Trine University,Phoenix,USA; Wake Forest University,Winston-Salem,USA","Ohio State University,Columbus,USA; Northeastern University,Seattle,USA; Columbia University,New York,USA; University of Utah,Salt Lake City,USA; Trine University,Phoenix,USA; Wake Forest University,Winston-Salem,USA"
TradingAgents: Multi-Agents LLM Financial Trading Framework,"Significant progress has been made in automated problem-solving using
societies of agents powered by large language models (LLMs). In finance,
efforts have largely focused on single-agent systems handling specific tasks or
multi-agent frameworks independently gathering data. However, multi-agent
systems' potential to replicate real-world trading firms' collaborative
dynamics remains underexplored. TradingAgents proposes a novel stock trading
framework inspired by trading firms, featuring LLM-powered agents in
specialized roles such as fundamental analysts, sentiment analysts, technical
analysts, and traders with varied risk profiles. The framework includes Bull
and Bear researcher agents assessing market conditions, a risk management team
monitoring exposure, and traders synthesizing insights from debates and
historical data to make informed decisions. By simulating a dynamic,
collaborative trading environment, this framework aims to improve trading
performance. Detailed architecture and extensive experiments reveal its
superiority over baseline models, with notable improvements in cumulative
returns, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, highlighting the potential of
multi-agent LLM frameworks in financial trading. TradingAgents is available at

"An empirical test for Eurozone contagion using an asset-pricing model
  with heavy-tailed stochastic volatility","This paper proposes an empirical test of financial contagion in European
equity markets during the tumultuous period of 2008-2011. Our analysis shows
that traditional GARCH and Gaussian stochastic-volatility models are unable to
explain two key stylized features of global markets during presumptive
contagion periods: shocks to aggregate market volatility can be sudden and
explosive, and they are associated with specific directional biases in the
cross-section of country-level returns. Our model repairs this deficit by
assuming that the random shocks to volatility are heavy-tailed and correlated
cross-sectionally, both with each other and with returns. The fundamental
conclusion of our analysis is that great care is needed in modeling volatility
if one wishes to characterize the relationship between volatility and contagion
that is predicted by economic theory.
  In analyzing daily data, we find evidence for significant contagion effects
during the major EU crisis periods of May 2010 and August 2011, where contagion
is defined as excess correlation in the residuals from a factor model
incorporating global and regional market risk factors. Some of this excess
correlation can be explained by quantifying the impact of shocks to aggregate
volatility in the cross-section of expected returns - but only, it turns out,
if one is extremely careful in accounting for the explosive nature of these
shocks. We show that global markets have time-varying cross-sectional
sensitivities to these shocks, and that high sensitivities strongly predict
periods of financial crisis. Moreover, the pattern of temporal changes in
correlation structure between volatility and returns is readily interpretable
in terms of the major events of the periods in question.",Nicholas G. Polson; James G.

"Long-Term Employment Effects of the Minimum Wage in Germany: New Data
  and Estimators","We study the long-term effects of the 2015 German minimum wage introduction
and its subsequent increases on regional employment. Using data from two waves
of the Structure of Earnings Survey allows us to estimate models that account
for changes in the minimum wage bite over time. While the introduction mainly
affected the labour market in East Germany, the raises are also increasingly
affecting low-wage regions in West Germany, such that around one third of
regions have changed their (binary) treatment status over time. We apply
different specifications and extensions of the classic
difference-in-differences approach as well as a set of new estimators that
enables for unbiased effect estimation with a staggered treatment adoption and
heterogeneous treatment effects. Our results indicate a small negative effect
on dependent employment of 0.5 percent, no significant effect on employment
subject to social security contributions, and a significant negative effect of
about 2.4 percent on marginal employment until the first quarter of 2022. The
extended specifications suggest additional effects of the minimum wage
increases, as well as stronger negative effects on total dependent and marginal
employment for those regions that were strongly affected by the minimum wage in
2015 and 2019.",Marco Caliendo; Nico Pestel; Rebecca Olthaus,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15964v1,False,True,False,False,False,1680.0,Xi He,Maryland,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2024.102648,"Economics, Term (time), Labour economics, Estimator, Wage, Wage growth, Panel data, Minimum wage, Econometrics, Statistics, Mathematics, Physics, Quantum mechanics",,,
A 22 percent increase in the German minimum wage: nothing crazy!,"We present the first empirical evidence on the 22 percent increase in the
German minimum wage, implemented in 2022, raising it from Euro 9.82 to 10.45 in
July and to Euro 12 in October. Leveraging the German Earnings Survey, a large
and novel data source comprising around 8 million employee-level observations
reported by employers each month, we apply a
difference-in-difference-in-differences approach to analyze the policy's impact
on hourly wages, monthly earnings, employment, and working hours. Our findings
reveal significant positive effects on wages, affirming the policy's intended
benefits for low-wage workers. Interestingly, we identify a negative effect on
working hours, mainly driven by minijobbers. The hours effect results in an
implied labor demand elasticity in terms of the employment volume of -0.2 which
only partially offsets the monthly wage gains. We neither observe a negative
effect on the individual's employment retention nor the regional employment

Can ChatGPT evaluate research quality?,"Purpose: Assess whether ChatGPT 4.0 is accurate enough to perform research
evaluations on journal articles to automate this time-consuming task.
Design/methodology/approach: Test the extent to which ChatGPT-4 can assess the
quality of journal articles using a case study of the published scoring
guidelines of the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021 to create a
research evaluation ChatGPT. This was applied to 51 of my own articles and
compared against my own quality judgements. Findings: ChatGPT-4 can produce
plausible document summaries and quality evaluation rationales that match the
REF criteria. Its overall scores have weak correlations with my self-evaluation
scores of the same documents (averaging r=0.281 over 15 iterations, with 8
being statistically significantly different from 0). In contrast, the average
scores from the 15 iterations produced a statistically significant positive
correlation of 0.509. Thus, averaging scores from multiple ChatGPT-4 rounds
seems more effective than individual scores. The positive correlation may be
due to ChatGPT being able to extract the author's significance, rigour, and
originality claims from inside each paper. If my weakest articles are removed,
then the correlation with average scores (r=0.200) falls below statistical
significance, suggesting that ChatGPT struggles to make fine-grained
evaluations. Research limitations: The data is self-evaluations of a
convenience sample of articles from one academic in one field. Practical
implications: Overall, ChatGPT does not yet seem to be accurate enough to be
trusted for any formal or informal research quality evaluation tasks. Research
evaluators, including journal editors, should therefore take steps to control
its use. Originality/value: This is the first published attempt at

Rate-Memory Trade-Off for Caching and Delivery of Correlated Sources,"This paper studies the fundamental limits of content delivery in a
cache-aided broadcast network for correlated content generated by a discrete
memoryless source with arbitrary joint distribution. Each receiver is equipped
with a cache of equal capacity, and the requested files are delivered over a
shared error-free broadcast link. A class of achievable correlation-aware
schemes based on a two-step source coding approach is proposed. Library files
are first compressed, and then cached and delivered using a combination of
correlation-unaware multiple-request cache-aided coded multicast schemes. The
first step uses Gray-Wyner source coding to represent the library via private
descriptions and descriptions that are common to more than one file. The second
step then becomes a multiple-request caching problem, where the demand
structure is dictated by the configuration of the compressed library, and it is
interesting in its own right. The performance of the proposed two-step scheme
is evaluated by comparing its achievable rate with a lower bound on the optimal
peak and average rate-memory tradeoffs in a two-file multiple-receiver network,
and in a three-file two-receiver network. Specifically, in a network with two
files and two receivers, the achievable rate matches the lower bound for a
significant memory regime and it is within half of the conditional entropy of
files for all other memory values. In the three-file two-receiver network, the
two-step strategy achieves the lower bound for large cache capacities, and it
is within half of the joint entropy of two of the sources conditioned on the
third one for all other cache sizes.",Parisa Hassanzadeh; Antonia M.

"Face It Yourselves: An LLM-Based Two-Stage Strategy to Localize
  Configuration Errors via Logs","Configurable software systems are prone to configuration errors, resulting in
significant losses to companies. However, diagnosing these errors is
challenging due to the vast and complex configuration space. These errors pose
significant challenges for both experienced maintainers and new end-users,
particularly those without access to the source code of the software systems.
Given that logs are easily accessible to most end-users, we conduct a
preliminary study to outline the challenges and opportunities of utilizing logs
in localizing configuration errors. Based on the insights gained from the
preliminary study, we propose an LLM-based two-stage strategy for end-users to
localize the root-cause configuration properties based on logs. We further
implement a tool, LogConfigLocalizer, aligned with the design of the
aforementioned strategy, hoping to assist end-users in coping with
configuration errors through log analysis.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to localize the
root-cause configuration properties for end-users based on Large Language
Models~(LLMs) and logs. We evaluate the proposed strategy on Hadoop by
LogConfigLocalizer and prove its efficiency with an average accuracy as high as

Network-Aware Optimization of Distributed Learning for Fog Computing,"Fog computing promises to enable machine learning tasks to scale to large
amounts of data by distributing processing across connected devices. Two key
challenges to achieving this goal are heterogeneity in devices compute
resources and topology constraints on which devices can communicate with each
other. We address these challenges by developing the first network-aware
distributed learning optimization methodology where devices optimally share
local data processing and send their learnt parameters to a server for
aggregation at certain time intervals. Unlike traditional federated learning
frameworks, our method enables devices to offload their data processing tasks
to each other, with these decisions determined through a convex data transfer
optimization problem that trades off costs associated with devices processing,
offloading, and discarding data points. We analytically characterize the
optimal data transfer solution for different fog network topologies, showing
for example that the value of offloading is approximately linear in the range
of computing costs in the network. Our subsequent experiments on testbed
datasets we collect confirm that our algorithms are able to improve network
resource utilization substantially without sacrificing the accuracy of the
learned model. In these experiments, we also study the effect of network
dynamics, quantifying the impact of nodes entering or exiting the network on
model learning and resource costs.",Su Wang; Yichen Ruan; Yuwei Tu; Satyavrat Wagle; Christopher G.

The Distributed Bloom Filter,"The Distributed Bloom Filter is a space-efficient, probabilistic data
structure designed to perform more efficient set reconciliations in distributed
systems. It guarantees eventual consistency of states between nodes in a
system, while still keeping bloom filter sizes as compact as possible. The
eventuality can be tweaked as desired, by tweaking the distributed bloom
filter's parameters. The scalability, as well as accuracy of the data structure
is made possible by combining two novel ideas: The first idea introduces a new,
computationally inexpensive way for populating bloom filters, making it
possible to quickly compute new bloom filters when interacting with peers. The
second idea introduces the concept of unique bloom filter mappings between
peers. By applying these two simple ideas, one can achieve incredibly
bandwidth-efficient set reconciliation in networks. Instead of trying to
minimize the false positive rate of a single bloom filter, we use the unique
bloom filter mappings to increase the probability for an element to propagate
through a network. We compare the standard bloom filter with the distributed
bloom filter and show that even with a false positive rate of 50%, i.e. even
with a very small bloom filter size, the distributed bloom filter still manages

particularly those exacerbated by climate change. Traditional zoning codes,
which often segregate land uses, have been linked to increased vehicular

adoption and impact of form-based codes (FBCs), which aim to promote
sustainable, compact, and mixed-use urban forms as a solution to these issues.
Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we analyzed zoning
documents from over 2000 U.S. census-designated places to identify linguistic
patterns indicative of FBC principles. Our findings reveal widespread adoption
of FBCs across the country, with notable variations within regions. FBCs are
associated with higher floor-to-area ratios, narrower and more consistent
street setbacks, and smaller plots. We also find that places with FBCs have
improved walkability, shorter commutes, and a higher share of multi-family
housing. Our findings highlight the utility of NLP for evaluating zoning codes

"In the Beginning there were n Agents: Founding and Amending a
  Constitution","Consider n agents forming an egalitarian, self-governed community. Their
first task is to decide on a decision rule to make further decisions. We start
from a rather general initial agreement on the decision-making process based
upon a set of intuitive and self-evident axioms, as well as simplifying
assumptions about the preferences of the agents. From these humble beginnings
we derive a decision rule. Crucially, the decision rule also specifies how it
can be changed, or amended, and thus acts as a de facto constitution. Our main
contribution is in providing an example of an initial agreement that is simple
and intuitive, and a constitution that logically follows from it. The naive
agreement is on the basic process of decision making - that agents approve or

"The Effect of Financial Resources on Fertility: Evidence from
  Administrative Data on Lottery Winners","This paper utilizes wealth shocks from winning lottery prizes to examine the
causal effect of financial resources on fertility. We employ extensive panels
of administrative data encompassing over 0.4 million lottery winners in Taiwan
and implement a triple-differences design. Our analyses reveal that a
substantial lottery win can significantly increase fertility, the implied
wealth elasticity of which is around 0.06. Moreover, the primary channel
through which fertility increases is by prompting first births among previously
childless individuals. Finally, our analysis reveals that approximately 25% of

the standard deviation of the turnout rate by municipality. The second one
refers to the continuity in time of the heterogeneity of turnout rates in the

Club Convergence of House Prices: Evidence from China's Ten Key Cities,"The latest global financial tsunami and its follow-up global economic
recession has uncovered the crucial impact of housing markets on financial and
economic systems. The Chinese stock market experienced a markedly fall during
the global financial tsunami and China's economy has also slowed down by about
2\%-3\% when measured in GDP. Nevertheless, the housing markets in diverse
Chinese cities seemed to continue the almost nonstop mania for more than ten
years. However, the structure and dynamics of the Chinese housing market are
less studied. Here we perform an extensive study of the Chinese housing market
by analyzing ten representative key cities based on both linear and nonlinear
econophysical and econometric methods. We identify a common collective driving
force which accounts for 96.5\% of the house price growth, indicating very high
systemic risk in the Chinese housing market. The ten key cities can be
categorized into clubs and the house prices of the cities in the same club
exhibit an evident convergence. These findings from different methods are
basically consistent with each other. The identified city clubs are also
consistent with the conventional classification of city tiers. The house prices
of the first-tier cities grow the fastest, and those of the third- and
fourth-tier cities rise the slowest, which illustrates the possible presence of
a ripple effect in the diffusion of house prices in different cities.",Hao Meng; Wen-Jie Xie; Wei-Xing Zhou,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05550v1,False,True,False,False,False,1739.0,Ludovica A Gazze,Chicago,Completed,2019.0,,"China, Club, Convergence (economics), Economics, Recession, Stock (firearms), Economy, Business, Economic growth, Geography, Macroeconomics, Medicine, Archaeology, Anatomy",East China University of Science and Technology,"Department of Mathematics, East China University of Science and Technology, 130 Meilong Road, Shanghai 200237, P.

"BEM: Balanced and Entropy-based Mix for Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised
  Learning","Data mixing methods play a crucial role in semi-supervised learning (SSL),
but their application is unexplored in long-tailed semi-supervised learning
(LTSSL). The primary reason is that the in-batch mixing manner fails to address
class imbalance. Furthermore, existing LTSSL methods mainly focus on
re-balancing data quantity but ignore class-wise uncertainty, which is also
vital for class balance. For instance, some classes with sufficient samples
might still exhibit high uncertainty due to indistinguishable features. To this
end, this paper introduces the Balanced and Entropy-based Mix (BEM), a
pioneering mixing approach to re-balance the class distribution of both data
quantity and uncertainty. Specifically, we first propose a class balanced mix
bank to store data of each class for mixing. This bank samples data based on
the estimated quantity distribution, thus re-balancing data quantity. Then, we
present an entropy-based learning approach to re-balance class-wise
uncertainty, including entropy-based sampling strategy, entropy-based selection
module, and entropy-based class balanced loss. Our BEM first leverages data
mixing for improving LTSSL, and it can also serve as a complement to the
existing re-balancing methods. Experimental results show that BEM significantly
enhances various LTSSL frameworks and achieves state-of-the-art performances
across multiple benchmarks.",Hongwei Zheng; Linyuan Zhou; Han Li; Jinming Su; Xiaoming Wei; Xiaoming Xu,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01179v1,False,True,False,False,False,1745.0,Hongwei Xu,Baruch,Completed,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr52733.2024.02160,"Computer science, Artificial intelligence, Entropy (arrow of time), Machine learning, Semi-supervised learning, Supervised learning, Artificial neural network, Physics, Quantum mechanics",Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Meituan,Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Meituan
Small Area Shrinkage Estimation,"The need for small area estimates is increasingly felt in both the public and
private sectors in order to formulate their strategic plans. It is now widely
recognized that direct small area survey estimates are highly unreliable owing
to large standard errors and coefficients of variation. The reason behind this
is that a survey is usually designed to achieve a specified level of accuracy
at a higher level of geography than that of small areas. Lack of additional
resources makes it almost imperative to use the same data to produce small area
estimates. For example, if a survey is designed to estimate per capita income
for a state, the same survey data need to be used to produce similar estimates
for counties, subcounties and census divisions within that state. Thus, by
necessity, small area estimation needs explicit, or at least implicit, use of
models to link these areas. Improved small area estimates are found by
""borrowing strength"" from similar neighboring areas.",G. Datta; M.

Fractional Imputation in Survey Sampling: A Comparative Review,"Fractional imputation (FI) is a relatively new method of imputation for
handling item nonresponse in survey sampling. In FI, several imputed values
with their fractional weights are created for each missing item. Each
fractional weight represents the conditional probability of the imputed value
given the observed data, and the parameters in the conditional probabilities
are often computed by an iterative method such as EM algorithm. The underlying
model for FI can be fully parametric, semiparametric, or nonparametric,
depending on plausibility of assumptions and the data structure.
  In this paper, we give an overview of FI, introduce key ideas and methods to
readers who are new to the FI literature, and highlight some new development.
We also provide guidance on practical implementation of FI and valid
inferential tools after imputation. We demonstrate the empirical performance of
FI with respect to multiple imputation using a pseudo finite population

"Trade-Offs Between Ranking Objectives: Reduced-Form Evidence and
  Structural Estimation","Online retailers and platforms typically present alternatives using ranked
product lists. By adjusting the ranking, these platforms influence consumers'
choices and, in turn, conversions, platform revenues, and consumer welfare. In
this paper, I study the trade-offs between ranking algorithms that target these
different objectives. First, I highlight and provide reduced-form evidence for
a key factor shaping these trade-offs: cross-product heterogeneity in position
effects. To quantify the effects of different rankings, I then develop an
empirical framework based on the search and discovery model of Greminger
(2022). For this framework, I show that the ranking that maximizes conversions
also maximizes consumer welfare, implying no trade-off between these two
objectives. Moreover, I develop and test a heuristic ranking algorithm to
maximize revenues. Finally, I estimate the model and compare the effects of the
rankings developed for the different objectives. The results highlight the
effectiveness of the different rankings and reveal that the proposed heuristic
to maximize revenues also increases consumer welfare, suggesting that the
trade-off between revenue maximization and consumer welfare also is limited.",Rafael P.

"Using administrative data to improve the estimation of immigration to
  local areas in England","International migration is now a significant driver of population change
across Europe but the methods available to estimate its true impact upon
sub-national areas remain inconsistent, constrained by inadequate systems of
measurement and data capture. In the absence of a population register for
England, official statistics on immigration and emigration are derived from a
combination of survey and census sources. This paper demonstrates how
administrative data systems such as those which capture registrations of recent
migrants with a local doctor, National Insurance Number registrations by
workers from abroad and the registration of foreign students for higher
education, can provide data to better understand patterns and trends in
international migration. The paper proposes a model for the estimation of
immigration at a local level, integrating existing national estimates from the
Office for National Statistics with data from these administrative sources. The
model attempts to circumvent conceptual differences between datasets through
the use of proportional distributions rather than absolute migrant counts in
the estimation process. The model methodology and the results it produces
provide alternative estimates of immigration for consideration by the Office
for National Statistics as it develops its own programme of improvement to
sub-national migration statistics.",Peter Boden; Phil Rees,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0507v2,False,True,False,False,False,1748.0,Annie E Ro,Irvine,Completed,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-985x.2009.00637.x,"Census, Estimation, Immigration, Emigration, Official statistics, Foreign national, Demographic statistics, Population, Demographic economics, Population statistics, Geography, Regional science, Econometrics, Statistics, Political science, Economics, Sociology, Demography, Mathematics, Management, Archaeology",University of Leeds,"University of Leeds , UK","University of Leeds , UK"
"Credit Crunch: The Role of Household Lending Capacity in the Dutch
  Housing Boom and Bust 1995-2018","What causes house prices to rise and fall? Economists identify household
access to credit as a crucial factor. ""Loan-to-Value"" and ""Debt-to-GDP"" ratios
are the standard measures for credit access. However, these measures fail to
explain the depth of the Dutch housing bust after the 2009 Financial Crisis.
This work is the first to model household lending capacity based on the
formulas that Dutch banks use in the mortgage application process. We compare
the ability of regression models to forecast housing prices when different
measures of credit access are utilised. We show that our measure of household
lending capacity is a forward-looking, highly predictive variable that
outperforms `Loan-to-Value' and debt ratios in forecasting the Dutch crisis.

The Snowball Stratosphere,"According to the Snowball Earth hypothesis, Earth has experienced periods of
low-latitude glaciation in its deep past. Prior studies have used general
circulation models (GCMs) to examine the effects such an extreme climate state
might have on the structure and dynamics of Earth's troposphere, but the
behavior of the stratosphere has not been studied in detail. Understanding the
snowball stratosphere is important for developing an accurate account of the
Earth's radiative and chemical properties during these episodes. Here we
conduct the first analysis of the stratospheric circulation of the Snowball
Earth using ECHAM6 general circulation model simulations. In order to
understand the factors contributing to the stratospheric circulation, we extend
the Statistical Transformed Eulerian Mean framework. We find that the
stratosphere during a snowball with prescribed modern ozone levels exhibits a
weaker meridional overturning circulation, reduced wave activity, stronger
zonal jets, and is extremely cold relative to modern conditions. Notably, the
snowball stratosphere displays no sudden stratospheric warmings. Without ozone,
the stratosphere displays slightly weaker circulation, a complete lack of polar
vortex, and even colder temperatures. We also explicitly quantify for the first
time the cross-tropopause mass exchange rate and stratospheric mixing
efficiency during the snowball and show that our values do not change the
constraints on CO$_2$ inferred from geochemical proxies during the Marinoan
glaciation ($\sim$635 Ma), unless the O$_2$ concentration during the snowball

unemployment by leveraging variation in the length of layoff notices. I

under which variation in notice length enables the identification of structural
duration dependence while allowing for arbitrary heterogeneity across workers.
Utilizing data from the Displaced Worker Supplement (DWS), I employ the
Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) to estimate the model. According to the
estimates, the decline in the exit rate over the first 48 weeks of unemployment
is largely due to the worsening composition of surviving jobseekers.
Furthermore, I find that an individual's likelihood of exiting unemployment
decreases initially, then increases until unemployment benefits run out, and
remains steady thereafter. These findings are consistent with a standard search

impact of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA). We
propose a matrix completion algorithm on French customs data to obtain
multidimensional counterfactuals at the firm, product and destination levels.
We find a small but significant positive impact on average at the product-level
intensive margin. On the other hand, the extensive margin shows product
churning due to the treaty beyond regular entry-exit dynamics: one product in
eight that was not previously exported substitutes almost as many that are no
longer exported. When we delve into the heterogeneity, we find that the effects
of the treaty are higher for products at a comparative advantage. Focusing on
multiproduct firms, we find that they adjust their portfolio in Canada by
reallocating towards their first and most exported product due to increasing
local market competition after trade liberalization. Finally, multidimensional
counterfactuals allow us to evaluate the general equilibrium effect of the
CETA. Specifically, we observe trade diversion, as exports to other
destinations are re-directed to Canada.",Lionel Fontagné; Francesca Micocci; Armando Rungi,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07652v3,False,True,False,False,False,1785.0,Ishan Nath,Chicago,Active,,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5026257,"Agreement, Chemistry, Psychology, Philosophy, Linguistics",,,
"Tracking Control foe Multi-Agent Systems Using Broadcast Signals Based
  on Positive Realness","Broadcast control is one of decentralized control methods for networked
multi-agent systems. In this method, each agent does not communicate with the
others, and autonomously determines its own action using only the same signal
sent from a central controller. Therefore, it is effective for systems with
numerous agents or no-communication between agents. However, it is difficult to
manage the stochastic action process of agents considering engineering
applications. This paper proposes a decentralized control such that agents
autonomously select the deterministic actions. Firstly, a non-linear controller
with a binary output of each agent including 0 is introduced in order to
express stop actions autonomously when the target is achieved. The asymptotic
stability to the target is proved. Secondly, the controller can adjust the
tendency of actions in order to make it easier to manage the actions. Thirdly,
the controller is extended to that with a continuous output in order to reduce
the tracking error to the target and the output vibration. Finally, the
effectiveness of the proposed control is verified by numerical experiments.",Yasushi Amano; Tomohiko Jimbo; Kenji Fujimoto,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06372v1,False,True,False,False,False,1787.0,Noriko Amano,Yale,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2109.06372,"Controller (irrigation), Computer science, Control theory (sociology), Process (computing), Multi-agent system, Action (physics), Stability (learning theory), Control (management), SIGNAL (programming language), Decentralised system, Control engineering, Engineering, Artificial intelligence, Physics, Quantum mechanics, Machine learning, Agronomy, Biology, Programming language, Operating system",,,
"Multivariate spatio-temporal models for high-dimensional areal data with
  application to Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics","Many data sources report related variables of interest that are also
referenced over geographic regions and time; however, there are relatively few
general statistical methods that one can readily use that incorporate these
multivariate spatio-temporal dependencies. Additionally, many multivariate
spatio-temporal areal data sets are extremely high dimensional, which leads to
practical issues when formulating statistical models. For example, we analyze
Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) published by the US Census Bureau's
Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program. QWIs are available by
different variables, regions, and time points, resulting in millions of
tabulations. Despite their already expansive coverage, by adopting a fully
Bayesian framework, the scope of the QWIs can be extended to provide estimates
of missing values along with associated measures of uncertainty. Motivated by
the LEHD, and other applications in federal statistics, we introduce the
multivariate spatio-temporal mixed effects model (MSTM), which can be used to
efficiently model high-dimensional multivariate spatio-temporal areal data
sets. The proposed MSTM extends the notion of Moran's I basis functions to the
multivariate spatio-temporal setting. This extension leads to several
methodological contributions, including extremely effective dimension
reduction, a dynamic linear model for multivariate spatio-temporal areal
processes, and the reduction of a high-dimensional parameter space using a
novel parameter model.",Jonathan R. Bradley; Scott H. Holan; Christopher K.

"Strategic Responses to Technological Change: Evidence from Online Labor
  Markets","In this project, we examine how freelancers changed their behavior on an
online work platform following the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. We first
document that, post-ChatGPT, freelancers bid on fewer jobs and reposition
themselves by differentiating their distribution of bids relative to their
prior behavior. We disentangle heterogeneity in repositioning across work
domains by exploring how exposure to changes in supply or demand underlie
repositioning. Decreases in the demand for labor post-ChatGPT lead workers to
reposition themselves by withdrawing from the focal market/exiting the platform
and changing their horizontal positioning (i.e., work domain), while increases
in the supply of labor post-ChatGPT are less likely to lead to changes in
volume of activity or horizontal positioning but more likely to result decrease
the proportion of bids to high-value jobs, perhaps in response to increased
competition. We further show that repositioning is less likely when adjustment
costs are higher due to greater skill. Our research contributes to our

Cross-sectional Dependence in Idiosyncratic Volatility,"This paper introduces an econometric framework for analyzing cross-sectional
dependence in the idiosyncratic volatilities of assets using high frequency
data. We first consider the estimation of standard measures of dependence in
the idiosyncratic volatilities such as covariances and correlations. Naive
estimators of these measures are biased due to the use of the error-laden
estimates of idiosyncratic volatilities. We provide bias-corrected estimators
and the relevant asymptotic theory. Next, we introduce an idiosyncratic
volatility factor model, in which we decompose the variation in idiosyncratic
volatilities into two parts: the variation related to the systematic factors
such as the market volatility, and the residual variation. Again, naive
estimators of the decomposition are biased, and we provide bias-corrected
estimators. We also provide the asymptotic theory that allows us to test
whether the residual (non-systematic) components of the idiosyncratic
volatilities exhibit cross-sectional dependence. We apply our methodology to
the S&P 100 index constituents, and document strong cross-sectional dependence
in their idiosyncratic volatilities. We consider two different sets of
idiosyncratic volatility factors, and find that neither can fully account for
the cross-sectional dependence in idiosyncratic volatilities. For each model,
we map out the network of dependencies in residual (non-systematic)
idiosyncratic volatilities across all stocks.",Ilze Kalnina; Kokouvi Tewou,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13437v1,False,True,False,False,False,1808.0,Chen Yeh,Fed Board,Completed,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.13140/rg.2.2.16190.54082,"Estimator, Econometrics, Volatility (finance), Systematic risk, Realized variance, Economics, Residual, Forward volatility, Statistics, Implied volatility, Mathematics, Algorithm",Université de Montréal,Universitè de Montreal,Universitè de Montreal
Economic Forces in Stock Returns,"When analyzing the components influencing the stock prices, it is commonly
believed that economic activities play an important role. More specifically,
asset prices are more sensitive to the systematic economic news that impose a
pervasive effect on the whole market. Moreover, the investors will not be
rewarded for bearing idiosyncratic risks as such risks are diversifiable. In
the paper Economic Forces and the Stock Market 1986, the authors introduced an
attribution model to identify the specific systematic economic forces
influencing the market. They first defined and examined five classic factors
from previous research papers: Industrial Production, Unanticipated Inflation,
Change in Expected Inflation, Risk Premia, and The Term Structure. By adding in
new factors, the Market Indices, Consumptions and Oil Prices, one by one, they
examined the significant contribution of each factor to the stock return. The
paper concluded that the stock returns are exposed to the systematic economic
news, and they are priced with respect to their risk exposure. Also, the
significant factors can be identified by simply adopting their model. Driven by
such motivation, we conduct an attribution analysis based on the general
framework of their model to further prove the importance of the economic
factors and identify the specific identity of significant factors.",Yue Chen; Mohan Li,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04132v1,False,True,False,False,False,1808.0,Chen Yeh,Fed Board,Completed,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gfj.2016.01.001,"Economics, Stock (firearms), Stock market bubble, China, Monetary economics, Stock market, Stock exchange, Depreciation (economics), Financial economics, Market liquidity, Market maker, Dividend, Negative correlation, Finance, Capital formation, Mechanical engineering, Medicine, Paleontology, Internal medicine, Horse, Financial capital, Political science, Law, Engineering, Biology, Economic growth, Human capital",Drexel University; Shanghai Stock Exchange,"Drexel University, LeBow Hall, 3220 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, United States; Shanghai Stock Exchange, 528 South Pudong Road, Shanghai 200120, PR China","Drexel University, LeBow Hall, 3220 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, United States; Shanghai Stock Exchange, 528 South Pudong Road, Shanghai 200120, PR China"

Economic Development and Inequality: a complex system analysis,"By borrowing methods from complex system analysis, in this paper we analyze
the features of the complex relationship that links the development and the
industrialization of a country to economic inequality. In order to do this, we
identify industrialization as a combination of a monetary index, the GDP per
capita, and a recently introduced measure of the complexity of an economy, the
Fitness. At first we explore these relations on a global scale over the time
period 1990--2008 focusing on two different dimensions of inequality: the
capital share of income and a Theil measure of wage inequality. In both cases,
the movement of inequality follows a pattern similar to the one theorized by
Kuznets in the fifties. We then narrow down the object of study ad we
concentrate on wage inequality within the United States. By employing data on
wages and employment on the approximately 3100 US counties for the time
interval 1990--2014, we generalize the Fitness-Complexity algorithm for
counties and NAICS sectors, and we investigate wage inequality between
industrial sectors within counties. At this scale, in the early nineties we
recover a behavior similar to the global one. While, in more recent years, we
uncover a trend reversal: wage inequality monotonically increases as
industrialization levels grow. Hence at a county level, at net of the social
and institutional factors that differ among countries, we not only observe an
upturn in inequality but also a change in the structure of the relation between
wage inequality and development.",Angelica Sbardella; Emanuele Pugliese; Luciano Pietronero,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03133v1,False,True,False,False,False,1819.0,David G Wiczer,Atlanta,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0182774,"Economics, Inequality, Industrialisation, Wage, Economic inequality, Gini coefficient, Per capita, Labour economics, Demographic economics, Market economy, Population, Demography, Sociology, Mathematical analysis, Mathematics",University of Rome Tor Vergata; Institute for Complex Systems; Sapienza University of Rome,"Faculty of Economics, Università degli Studi di Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy; Department of Physics, Sapienza Università di Roma, Rome, Italy; ISC-CNR – Institute of Complex Systems, Rome, Italy","Faculty of Economics, Università degli Studi di Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy; Department of Physics, Sapienza Università di Roma, Rome, Italy; ISC-CNR – Institute of Complex Systems, Rome, Italy"
"The Mortgage Cash-Flow Channel: How Rising Interest Rates Impact
  Household Consumption","This study investigates the impact of increased debt servicing costs on
household consumption resulting from monetary policy tightening. It utilizes
observational panel microdata on all mortgage holders in Israel and leverages
quasi-exogenous variation in exposure to adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) due
to a regulatory shift. Our analysis indicates that when monetary policy became
more restrictive, consumers with a higher ratio of ARMs experienced a more
marked reduction in their consumption patterns. This effect is predominantly
observed in mid- to lower-income households and those with a higher ratio of
mortgage payments to total spending. These findings highlight the substantial
role of the mortgage cash-flow channel in monetary policy transmission,
emphasizing its implications for economic stability and inequality.",Itamar Caspi; Nadav Eshel; Nimrod Segev,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02445v1,False,True,False,False,False,1831.0,Xiao Cen,Texas,Active,,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4957048,"Consumption (sociology), Cash flow, Economics, Interest rate, Channel (broadcasting), Flow (mathematics), Monetary economics, Business, Finance, Computer science, Telecommunications, Mechanics, Physics, Social science, Sociology",,,
Insurance valuation: a computable multi-period cost-of-capital approach,"We present an approach to market-consistent multi-period valuation of
insurance liability cash flows based on a two-stage valuation procedure. First,
a portfolio of traded financial instrument aimed at replicating the liability
cash flow is fixed. Then the residual cash flow is managed by repeated
one-period replication using only cash funds. The latter part takes capital
requirements and costs into account, as well as limited liability and risk
averseness of capital providers. The cost-of-capital margin is the value of the
residual cash flow. We set up a general framework for the cost-of-capital
margin and relate it to dynamic risk measurement. Moreover, we present explicit
formulas and properties of the cost-of-capital margin under further assumptions
on the model for the liability cash flow and on the conditional risk measures

"Simulate and Optimise: A two-layer mortgage simulator for designing
  novel mortgage assistance products","We develop a novel two-layer approach for optimising mortgage relief products
through a simulated multi-agent mortgage environment. While the approach is
generic, here the environment is calibrated to the US mortgage market based on
publicly available census data and regulatory guidelines. Through the
simulation layer, we assess the resilience of households to exogenous income
shocks, while the optimisation layer explores strategies to improve the
robustness of households to these shocks by making novel mortgage assistance
products available to households. Households in the simulation are adaptive,
learning to make mortgage-related decisions (such as product enrolment or
strategic foreclosures) that maximize their utility, balancing their available
liquidity and equity. We show how this novel two-layer simulation approach can
successfully design novel mortgage assistance products to improve household
resilience to exogenous shocks, and balance the costs of providing such
products through post-hoc analysis. Previously, such analysis could only be
conducted through expensive pilot studies involving real participants,
demonstrating the benefit of the approach for designing and evaluating
financial products.",Leo Ardon; Benjamin Patrick Evans; Deepeka Garg; Annapoorani Lakshmi Narayanan; Makada Henry-Nickie; Sumitra Ganesh,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00563v1,False,True,False,False,False,1831.0,Xiao Cen,Texas,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1145/3677052.3698607,"Computer science, Layer (electronics), Simulation, Materials science, Nanotechnology",,,
"Relevance distributions across Bradford Zones: Can Bradfordizing improve
  search?","The purpose of this paper is to describe the evaluation of the effectiveness
of the bibliometric technique Bradfordizing in an information retrieval (IR)
scenario. Bradfordizing is used to re-rank topical document sets from
conventional abstracting & indexing (A&I) databases into core and more
peripheral document zones. Bradfordized lists of journal articles and
monographs will be tested in a controlled scenario consisting of different A&I
databases from social and political sciences, economics, psychology and medical
science, 164 standardized IR topics and intellectual assessments of the listed
documents. Does Bradfordizing improve the ratio of relevant documents in the
first third (core) compared to the second and last third (zone 2 and zone 3,
respectively)? The IR tests show that relevance distributions after re-ranking
improve at a significant level if documents in the core are compared with
documents in the succeeding zones. After Bradfordizing of document pools, the
core has a significant better average precision than zone 2, zone 3 and
baseline. This paper should be seen as an argument in favour of alternative

Automatic Estimation of Simultaneous Interpreter Performance,"Simultaneous interpretation, translation of the spoken word in real-time, is
both highly challenging and physically demanding. Methods to predict
interpreter confidence and the adequacy of the interpreted message have a
number of potential applications, such as in computer-assisted interpretation
interfaces or pedagogical tools. We propose the task of predicting simultaneous
interpreter performance by building on existing methodology for quality
estimation (QE) of machine translation output. In experiments over five
settings in three language pairs, we extend a QE pipeline to estimate

"Anomaly Detection of Particle Orbit in Accelerator using LSTM Deep
  Learning Technology","A stable, reliable, and controllable orbit lock system is crucial to an
electron (or ion) accelerator because the beam orbit and beam energy
instability strongly affect the quality of the beam delivered to experimental
halls. Currently, when the orbit lock system fails operators must manually
intervene. This paper develops a Machine Learning based fault detection
methodology to identify orbit lock anomalies and notify accelerator operations
staff of the off-normal behavior. Our method is unsupervised, so it does not
require labeled data. It uses Long-Short Memory Networks (LSTM) Auto Encoder to
capture normal patterns and predict future values of monitoring sensors in the
orbit lock system. Anomalies are detected when the prediction error exceeds a
threshold. We conducted experiments using monitoring data from Jefferson Lab's
Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF). The results are
promising: the percentage of real anomalies identified by our solution is
68.6%-89.3% using monitoring data of a single component in the orbit lock

"Competing for Attention -- The Effect of Talk Radio on Elections and
  Political Polarization in the US","This paper studies the effects of talk radio, specifically the Rush Limbaugh
Show, on electoral outcomes and attitude polarization in the U.S. We propose a
novel identification strategy that considers the radio space in each county as
a market where multiple stations are competing for listeners' attention. Our
measure of competition is a spatial Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) in radio
frequencies. To address endogeneity concerns, we exploit the variation in
competition based on accidental frequency overlaps in a county, conditional on
the overall level of radio frequency competition. We find that counties with
higher exposure to the Rush Limbaugh Show have a systematically higher vote
share for Donald Trump in the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections.
Combining our county-level Rush Limbaugh Show exposure measure with individual
survey data reveals that self-identifying Republicans in counties with higher
exposure to the Show express more conservative political views, while
self-identifying Democrats in these same counties express more moderate
political views. Taken together, these findings provide some of the first
insights on the effects of contemporary talk radio on political outcomes, both
at the aggregate and individual level.",Ashani Amarasinghe; Paul A.

"A scalable two-stage Bayesian approach accounting for exposure
  measurement error in environmental epidemiology","Accounting for exposure measurement errors has been recognized as a crucial
problem in environmental epidemiology for over two decades. Bayesian
hierarchical models offer a coherent probabilistic framework for evaluating
associations between environmental exposures and health effects, which take
into account exposure measurement errors introduced by uncertainty in the
estimated exposure as well as spatial misalignment between the exposure and
health outcome data. While two-stage Bayesian analyses are often regarded as a
good alternative to fully Bayesian analyses when joint estimation is not
feasible, there has been minimal research on how to properly propagate
uncertainty from the first-stage exposure model to the second-stage health
model, especially in the case of a large number of participant locations along
with spatially correlated exposures. We propose a scalable two-stage Bayesian
approach, called a sparse multivariate normal (sparse MVN) prior approach,
based on the Vecchia approximation for assessing associations between exposure
and health outcomes in environmental epidemiology. We compare its performance
with existing approaches through simulation. Our sparse MVN prior approach
shows comparable performance with the fully Bayesian approach, which is a gold
standard but is impossible to implement in some cases. We investigate the
association between source-specific exposures and pollutant (nitrogen dioxide
(NO$_2$))-specific exposures and birth outcomes for 2012 in Harris County,
Texas, using several approaches, including the newly developed method.",Changwoo J. Lee; Elaine Symanski; Amal Rammah; Dong Hun Kang; Philip K.

Allocation of COVID-19 Testing Budget on a Commute Network of Counties,"The screening testing is an effective tool to control the early spread of an
infectious disease such as COVID-19. When the total testing capacity is
limited, we aim to optimally allocate testing resources among n counties. We
build a (weighted) commute network on counties, with the weight between two
counties a decreasing function of their traffic distance. We introduce a
network-based disease model, in which the number of newly confirmed cases of
each county depends on the numbers of hidden cases of all counties on the
network. Our proposed testing allocation strategy first uses historical data to
learn model parameters and then decides the testing rates for all counties by
solving an optimization problem. We apply the method on the commute networks of
Massachusetts, USA and Hubei, China and observe its advantages over testing
allocation strategies that ignore the network structure. Our approach can also
be extended to study the vaccine allocation problem.",Yaxuan Huang; Zheng Tracy Ke; Jiashun Jin,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04381v2,False,True,False,False,False,1849.0,Jason Fletcher,Wisconsin,Active,,,"Computer science, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Resource allocation, Optimal allocation, Operations research, Budget constraint, Function (biology), Control (management), Location-allocation, Mathematical optimization, Infectious disease (medical specialty), Computer network, Economics, Artificial intelligence, Disease, Engineering, Mathematics, Microeconomics, Medicine, Biology, Pathology, Evolutionary biology",,,
"A Generalist, Automated ALFALFA Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation","The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR) has applications in galaxy
evolution as a testbed for the galaxy-halo connection and in observational
cosmology as a redshift-independent secondary distance indicator. We use the
31,000+ galaxy ALFALFA sample -- which provides redshifts, velocity widths, and
HI content for a large number of gas-bearing galaxies in the local universe --
to fit and test an extensive local universe BTFR. This BTFR is designed to be
as inclusive of ALFALFA and comparable samples as possible. Velocity widths
measured via an automated method and $M_{b}$ proxies extracted from survey data
can be uniformly and efficiently measured for other samples, giving this
analysis broad applicability. We also investigate the role of sample
demographics in determining the best-fit relation. We find that the best-fit
relations are changed significantly by changes to the sample mass range and to
second order, mass sampling, gas fraction, different stellar mass and velocity
width measurements. We use a subset of ALFALFA with demographics that reflect
the full sample to measure a robust BTFR slope of $3.30\pm0.06$. We apply this
relation and estimate source distances, finding general agreement with
flow-model distances as well as average distance uncertainties of $\sim0.17$
dex for the full ALFALFA sample. We demonstrate the utility of these distance
estimates by applying them to a sample of sources in the Virgo vicinity,
recovering signatures of infall consistent with previous work.",Catie J. Ball; Martha P. Haynes; Michael G. Jones; Bo Peng; Adriana Durbala; Rebecca A.

Bayesian Spatial Change of Support for Count-Valued Survey Data,"We introduce Bayesian spatial change of support methodology for count-valued
survey data with known survey variances. Our proposed methodology is motivated
by the American Community Survey (ACS), an ongoing survey administered by the
U.S. Census Bureau that provides timely information on several key demographic
variables. Specifically, the ACS produces 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year
""period-estimates,"" and corresponding margins of errors, for published
demographic and socio-economic variables recorded over predefined geographies
within the United States. Despite the availability of these predefined
geographies it is often of interest to data users to specify customized
user-defined spatial supports. In particular, it is useful to estimate
demographic variables defined on ""new"" spatial supports in ""real-time."" This
problem is known as spatial change of support (COS), which is typically
performed under the assumption that the data follows a Gaussian distribution.
However, count-valued survey data is naturally non-Gaussian and, hence, we
consider modeling these data using a Poisson distribution. Additionally,
survey-data are often accompanied by estimates of error, which we incorporate
into our analysis. We interpret Poisson count-valued data in small areas as an
aggregation of events from a spatial point process. This approach provides us
with the flexibility necessary to allow ACS users to consider a variety of
spatial supports in ""real-time."" We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach through a simulated example as well as through an analysis using
public-use ACS data.",Jonathan R. Bradley; Christopher K. Wikle; Scott H.

"A Super-Fast Distributed Algorithm for Bipartite Metric Facility
  Location","The \textit{facility location} problem consists of a set of
\textit{facilities} $\mathcal{F}$, a set of \textit{clients} $\mathcal{C}$, an
\textit{opening cost} $f_i$ associated with each facility $x_i$, and a
\textit{connection cost} $D(x_i,y_j)$ between each facility $x_i$ and client
$y_j$. The goal is to find a subset of facilities to \textit{open}, and to
connect each client to an open facility, so as to minimize the total facility
opening costs plus connection costs. This paper presents the first
expected-sub-logarithmic-round distributed O(1)-approximation algorithm in the
$\mathcal{CONGEST}$ model for the \textit{metric} facility location problem on
the complete bipartite network with parts $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{C}$. Our

of our recent work (ICALP 2012) in which we presented the first
sub-logarithmic-round distributed O(1)-approximation algorithm for metric
facility location on a \textit{clique} network. The bipartite setting presents
several new challenges not present in the problem on a clique network. We
present two new techniques to overcome these challenges. (i) In order to deal
with the problem of not being able to choose appropriate probabilities (due to
lack of adequate knowledge), we design an algorithm that performs a random walk
over a probability space and analyze the progress our algorithm makes as the
random walk proceeds. (ii) In order to deal with a problem of quickly
disseminating a collection of messages, possibly containing many duplicates,

Super-Fast Distributed Algorithms for Metric Facility Location,"This paper presents a distributed O(1)-approximation algorithm, with

main technical contributions. First, we show a new lower bound for metric
facility location, extending the lower bound of B\u{a}doiu et al. (ICALP 2005)
that applies only to the special case of uniform facility opening costs. Next,
we demonstrate a reduction of the distributed metric facility location problem
to the problem of computing an O(1)-ruling set of an appropriate spanning

Dynamic Facility Location via Exponential Clocks,"The \emph{dynamic facility location problem} is a generalization of the
classic facility location problem proposed by Eisenstat, Mathieu, and Schabanel
to model the dynamics of evolving social/infrastructure networks. The
generalization lies in that the distance metric between clients and facilities
changes over time. This leads to a trade-off between optimizing the classic
objective function and the ""stability"" of the solution: there is a switching
cost charged every time a client changes the facility to which it is connected.
While the standard linear program (LP) relaxation for the classic problem
naturally extends to this problem, traditional LP-rounding techniques do not,
as they are often sensitive to small changes in the metric resulting in
frequent switches.
  We present a new LP-rounding algorithm for facility location problems, which
yields the first constant approximation algorithm for the dynamic facility
location problem. Our algorithm installs competing exponential clocks on the
clients and facilities, and connect every client by the path that repeatedly
follows the smallest clock in the neighborhood. The use of exponential clocks
gives rise to several properties that distinguish our approach from previous
LP-roundings for facility location problems. In particular, we use \emph{no

  Construction Operations","In this paper we present an overview of the methods and systems that give
rise to a flying robotic system capable of autonomous inspection, surveying,
comprehensive multi-modal mapping and inventory tracking of construction sites

either no prior knowledge of the environment or by integrating a prior model of
it. In the first case, autonomous exploration is provided which returns a high

Voluntary Disclosure and Personalized Pricing,"Central to privacy concerns is that firms may use consumer data to price
discriminate. A common policy response is that consumers should be given
control over which firms access their data and how. Since firms learn about a
consumer's preferences based on the data seen and the consumer's disclosure
choices, the equilibrium implications of consumer control are unclear. We study
whether such measures improve consumer welfare in monopolistic and competitive
markets. We find that consumer control can improve consumer welfare relative to
both perfect price discrimination and no personalized pricing. First, consumers
can use disclosure to amplify competitive forces. Second, consumers can
disclose information to induce even a monopolist to lower prices. Whether
consumer control improves welfare depends on the disclosure technology and
market competitiveness. Simple disclosure technologies suffice in competitive
markets. When facing a monopolist, a consumer needs partial disclosure
possibilities to obtain any welfare gains.",S.

An Economical Business-Cycle Model,"This paper develops a new model of business cycles. The model is economical
in that it is solved with an aggregate demand-aggregate supply diagram, and the
effects of shocks and policies are obtained by comparative statics. The model
builds on two unconventional assumptions. First, producers and consumers meet
through a matching function. Thus, the model features unemployment, which
fluctuates in response to aggregate demand and supply shocks. Second, wealth
enters the utility function, so the model allows for permanent zero-lower-bound
episodes. In the model, the optimal monetary policy is to set the interest rate
at the level that eliminates the unemployment gap. This optimal interest rate
is computed from the prevailing unemployment gap and monetary multiplier (the
effect of the nominal interest rate on the unemployment rate). If the
unemployment gap is exceedingly large, monetary policy cannot eliminate it

have a higher likelihood of experiencing anxiety (OR: 1.42, p<0.001) and
depression (OR: 1.57, p<0.001). Furthermore, youth experiencing both mental
health conditions and housing instability are significantly less likely to
receive mental health services in the past year, indicating the substantial
barriers they face in accessing mental health care. Based on our findings, we

"Automatically Detecting Self-Reported Birth Defect Outcomes on Twitter
  for Large-scale Epidemiological Research","In recent work, we identified and studied a small cohort of Twitter users
whose pregnancies with birth defect outcomes could be observed via their
publicly available tweets. Exploiting social media's large-scale potential to
complement the limited methods for studying birth defects, the leading cause of
infant mortality, depends on the further development of automatic methods. The
primary objective of this study was to take the first step towards scaling the
use of social media for observing pregnancies with birth defect outcomes,
namely, developing methods for automatically detecting tweets by users
reporting their birth defect outcomes. We annotated and pre-processed
approximately 23,000 tweets that mention birth defects in order to train and
evaluate supervised machine learning algorithms, including feature-engineered
and deep learning-based classifiers. We also experimented with various
under-sampling and over-sampling approaches to address the class imbalance. A
Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on the original, imbalanced
data set, with n-grams, word clusters, and structural features, achieved the
best baseline performance for the positive classes: an F1-score of 0.65 for the
""defect"" class and 0.51 for the ""possible defect"" class. Our contributions
include (i) natural language processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning
methods for automatically detecting tweets by users reporting their birth
defect outcomes, (ii) a comparison of feature-engineered and deep
learning-based classifiers trained on imbalanced, under-sampled, and
over-sampled data, and (iii) an error analysis that could inform classification
improvements using our publicly available corpus. Future work will focus on
automating user-level analyses for cohort inclusion.",Ari Z.

Dynamic Multi-Factor Clustering of Financial Networks,"We investigate the tendency for financial instruments to form clusters when
there are multiple factors influencing the correlation structure. Specifically,
we consider a stock portfolio which contains companies from different
industrial sectors, located in several different countries. Both sector
membership and geography combine to create a complex clustering structure where
companies seem to first be divided based on sector, with geographical
subclusters emerging within each industrial sector. We argue that standard
techniques for detecting overlapping clusters and communities are not able to
capture this type of structure, and show how robust regression techniques can
instead be used to remove the influence of both sector and geography from the
correlation matrix separately. Our analysis reveals that prior to the 2008
financial crisis, companies did not tend to form clusters based on geography.
This changed immediately following the crisis, with geography becoming a more
important determinant of clustering.",Gordon J.

"Multifractal analysis of racially-constrained population patterns and
  residential segregation in the US cities","A phenomenon of racial segregation in U.S. cities is a multifaceted area of
study. A recent advancement in this field is the development of a methodology
that transforms census population count-by-race data into a grid of monoracial
cells. This format enables assessment of heterogeneity of segregation within a
city. This paper leverages such a grid for the quantification of
race-constrained population patterns, allowing for the calculation and mapping
of binary segregation patterns within arbitrary region. A key innovation is the
application of Multifractal Analysis (MFA) to quantify the residency patterns
of race-constrained populations. The residency pattern is characterized by a
multifractal spectrum function, where the independent variable is a local
metric of pattern's ""gappiness"", and the dependent variable is proportional to
the size of the sub-pattern consisting of all locations having the same value
of this metric. In the context of binary populations, the gappiness of the
race-constrained population's pattern is intrinsically linked to its
segregation. This paper provides a comprehensive description of the
methodology, illustrated with examples focusing on the residency pattern of
Black population in the central region of Washington, DC. Further, the
methodology is demonstrated using a sample of residency patterns of Black
population in fourteen large U.S. cities. By numerically describing each
pattern through a multifractal spectrum, the fourteen patterns are clustered
into three distinct categories, each having unique characteristics. Maps of
local gappiness and segregation for each city are provided to show the
connection between the nature of the multifractal spectrum and the
corresponding residency and segregation patterns. This method offers an
excellent quantification of race-restricted residency and residential
segregation patterns within U.S. cities.",Tomasz F.

"Development of current estimated household data and agent-based
  simulation of the future population distribution of households in Japan","In response to the declining population and aging infrastructure in Japan,
local governments are implementing compact city policies such as the location
normalization plan. To optimize the reorganization of urban public
infrastructure, it is important to provide detailed and accurate forecasts of
the distribution of urban populations and households. However, many local
governments do not have the necessary data and forecasting capability.
Moreover, current forecasts of gender- and age-based population data only exist
at the municipal level, and household data are only available by family type at
the prefecture level. Meanwhile, the accuracy is limited with an assumption of
same change rate of population in all municipalities and within each city.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop an agent-based microsimulation
household transition model, with the household as the unit and agent, and
household data was estimated for all cities in Japan from 2015. Estimated
household data comprised the family type, house type, and address, age, and
gender of household members, obtained from the national census, and building
data. The resulting household transition model was used to forecast the
attributes of each household every five years. Simulations in Toyama and
Shizuoka Prefectures, Japan from 1980 to 2010 provided highly accurate
estimates of municipal-level population by age and household volume by family
type. The proposed model was also applied to predict the future distribution of
disappearing villages and vacant houses in Japan.",Kajiwara Kento; Jue Ma; Toshikazu Seto; Yoshihide Sekimoto; Yoshiki Ogawa; Hiroshi Omata,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00198v1,False,True,False,False,False,1901.0,Jared Carbone,Colorado,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2022.101873,"Census, Population, Distribution (mathematics), Microsimulation, Geography, Unit (ring theory), Normalization (sociology), Demographic economics, Business, Economic growth, Economics, Demography, Transport engineering, Engineering, Mathematics, Mathematics education, Sociology, Anthropology, Mathematical analysis",Mitsui & Co (Japan); Komazawa University; The University of Tokyo,"Mitsui Fudosan Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan; Center for Spatial Information Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Geography, Komazawa University, Tokyo, Japan","Mitsui Fudosan Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan; Center for Spatial Information Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Geography, Komazawa University, Tokyo, Japan"
"Estimation of the Effect of Carbon Tax Implementation on Household
  Income Distribution in Indonesia: Quantitative Analysis with Miyazawa Input-
  Output Approach","Climate change is a global challenge caused by greenhouse gas emissions from
fossil fuel use. Indonesia, as a developing country, faces major challenges in
implementing carbon tax policies to reduce emissions, especially related to
their regressive impacts on low-income households. Currently, there is little
in-depth research on how carbon tax policies impact household income
distribution in Indonesia. This study uses a quantitative approach with the
Input- Output model to analyze the impact of carbon tax on household income
based on 10 income groups, both in urban and rural areas. The results show that
carbon tax policies have a regressive impact, where low-income households bear
a proportionally greater burden. Household income in Class - 10 decreased by
IDR 19,144.85 million in urban areas and IDR 8,819.13 million in rural areas,
while households in Class - 1 decreased by IDR 954.23 million. Therefore,
mitigation policies such as cross subsidies are needed to reduce the impact on
vulnerable groups. These findings are important for policy makers in
formulating fair and effective fiscal policies, as well as ensuring social
justice in the context of sustainable development. This study has limitations
in the scope of analysis of long-term energy consumption behavior and certain
sectors, so further research is needed to deepen these aspects.",Syahrituah Siregar,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08177v1,False,True,False,False,False,1901.0,Jared Carbone,Colorado,Active,,,No keywords found,,,
"Power to the teens? A model of parents' and teens' collective labor

Hogares from 2011 to 2019 and a conditional cash transfer program. First, I
present gender differences in household responses to the transfer using a
marginal treatment effect framework. Second, I explain how the gender gap from
the results is due to the bargaining process between parents and teens. I
propose a collective household model and show that sons bargain cooperatively
with their parents while daughters do not. This result implies that sons have a
higher opportunity cost of attending school than daughters. Public policy
targeting teens must account for this gender disparity to be effective.",José Alfonso Muñoz-Alvarado,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09634v1,False,True,False,False,False,1901.0,Jared Carbone,Colorado,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2307.09634,"Delegate, Conditional cash transfer, Bargaining power, Economics, Cash transfers, Power (physics), Cash, Labour economics, Demographic economics, Microeconomics, Economic growth, Poverty, Physics, Quantum mechanics, Computer science, Macroeconomics, Programming language",,,
"Import competition and domestic vertical integration: Theory and

choices? Existing literature has predominantly focused on the relationship
between import competition and firms' global production networks, with less
attention given to domestic. We first develop a Nash-bargaining model to guide
our empirical analysis, then utilize tariff changes as an exogenous shock to
test our theoretical hypotheses using a database of Chinese listed firms from
2000 to 2023. Our findings indicate that a decrease in downstream tariffs lead
to an increase in vertical integration. In our mechanism tests, we discover
that a reduction in upstream tariffs also enhances this effect. Moreover, the
impact of tariff reductions on vertical integration is primarily observed in
industries with high asset specificity, indicating that asset-specificity is a
crucial mechanism. We further explore whether import competition encourages
vertical integration for technological acquisition purpose, the effect is found

Production Networks and War,"How do severe shocks such as war alter the economy? We study how a country's
production network is affected by a devastating but localized conflict. Using
unique transaction-level data on Ukrainian railway shipments around the start
of the 2014 Russia-Ukraine crisis, we uncover several novel indirect effects of
conflict on firms. First, we document substantial propagation effects on
interfirm trade--trade declines even between partners outside the conflict
areas if one of them had traded with those areas before the conflict events.
The magnitude of such second-degree effect of conflict is one-fifth of the
first-degree effect. Ignoring this propagation would lead to an underestimate
of the total impact of conflict on trade by about 67\%. Second, war induces
sudden changes in the production-network structure that influence firm
performance. Specifically, we find that firms that exogenously became more
central--after the conflict practically cut off certain regions from the rest
of Ukraine--received a relative boost to their revenues. Finally, in a
production-network model, we separately estimate the effects of the exogenous
firm removal and the subsequent endogenous network adjustment on firm revenue
distribution. For a median firm, network adjustment compensates for 80\% of the
network destruction a year after the conflict onset.",Vasily Korovkin; Alexey Makarin,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14756v4,False,True,False,False,False,1908.0,Xavier A Giroud,Baruch,Completed,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3969161,"Production (economics), Revenue, Economics, Database transaction, Spanish Civil War, Ukrainian, Rest (music), Business, Monetary economics, Microeconomics, Geography, Computer science, Finance, Medicine, Linguistics, Philosophy, Cardiology, Archaeology, Programming language",Centre for Economic Policy Research; Einaudi Institute for Economics and Finance; Center for Economic Research and Graduate Education – Economics Institute,Einaudi Institute for Economics and Finance (EIEF); CERGE-EI; Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR),CERGE-EI; Einaudi Institute for Economics and Finance (EIEF); Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR)
"Education Opportunities for Rural Areas: Evidence from China's Higher
  Education Expansion","This paper explores the causal impact of education opportunities on rural
areas by exploiting the higher education expansion (HEE) in China in 1999. By
utilizing the detailed census data, the cohort-based difference-in-differences
design indicates that the HEE increased college attendance and encouraged more
people to attend senior high schools and that the effect is more significant in
rural areas. Then we apply a similar approach to a novel panel data set of
rural villages and households to examine the effect of education opportunities
on rural areas. We find contrasting impacts on income and life quality between
villages and households. Villages in provinces with higher HEE magnitudes
underwent a drop in the average income and worse living facilities. On the
contrary, households sending out migrants after the HEE experienced an increase
in their per capita income. The phenomenon where villages experienced a ``brain
drain'' and households with migrants gained after the HEE is explained by the
fact that education could serve as a way to overcome the barrier of rural-urban
migration. Our findings highlight the opposed impacts of education
opportunities on rural development and household welfare in rural areas.",Ande Shen; Jiwei Zhou,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12915v1,False,True,False,False,False,1920.0,Seth G Sanders,Triangle,Completed,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2408.12915,"China, Economic growth, Rural area, Political science, Geography, Economic geography, Economics, Law",,,
"""Computer Science for all"": Concepts to engage teenagers and non-CS
  students in technology","Knowledge in Computer Science (CS) is essential, and companies have increased
their demands for CS professionals. Despite this, many jobs remain unfilled.
Furthermore, employees with computational thinking (CT) skills are required,
even if they are not actual technicians. Moreover, the gender disparity in
technology related fields is a serious problem. Even if companies want to hire
women in technology, the number of women who enter these fields is remarkably
low. In high schools, most teenagers acquire only low-level skills in CS. Thus,
they may never understand the fundamental concepts of CS, have unrealistic
expectations or preconceptions, and are influenced by stereotype-based
expectations. Consequently, many teenagers exclude computing as a career path.
In this research study, we present two promising concepts to overcome these
challenges. First, we consider alternative paths to enter the field of CS. In
2018, a voluntary lecture ""Design your own app"" at the University of Graz for
students of all degree programs was introduced. In total, 202 students
participated. We applied a Game Development-Based Learning (GDBL) approach with
the visual coding tool Pocket Code, a mobile app developed at Graz University
of Technology. The students were supposed to create simple games directly on
smartphones. The course received positive evaluations and led to our second
concept; In January 2019, we started to design a MOOC (Massive Open Online
Course) with the title ""Get FIT in Computer Science"". First, this course can be
used to encourage young women who have little to no previous knowledge in CS.
Second, it should help all teenagers to get a more realistic picture of CS to
its basic concepts. Third, teachers can use the course materials to lead high
school classes (Open Educational Resources). Finally, the MOOC can be accessed
by everyone interested in this topic.",Bernadette Spieler; Maria Grandl; Martin Ebner; Wolfgang Slany,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06637v2,False,True,False,False,False,1920.0,Seth G Sanders,Triangle,Completed,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.34190/gbl.19.057,"Coding (social sciences), Computer science, Mathematics education, Computational thinking, Field (mathematics), Psychology, Sociology, Mathematics, Social science, Pure mathematics",,,
"Revisiting the thermal and superthermal two-class distribution of
  incomes: A critical perspective","This paper offers a two-pronged critique of the empirical investigation of
the income distribution performed by physicists over the past decade. Their
finding rely on the graphical analysis of the observed distribution of
normalized incomes. Two central observations lead to the conclusion that the
majority of incomes are exponentially distributed, but neither each individual
piece of evidence nor their concurrent observation robustly proves that the
thermal and superthermal mixture fits the observed distribution of incomes
better than reasonable alternatives. A formal analysis using popular measures
of fit shows that while an exponential distribution with a power-law tail
provides a better fit of the IRS income data than the log-normal distribution
(often assumed by economists), the thermal and superthermal mixture's fit can
be improved upon further by adding a log-normal component. The economic

positive and negative components. The positive components represent the rising
markets and the negative components embody the falling markets. The sample
period covers some part of the COVID19 pandemic. Since the data is non normal
and the volatility is time varying, the bootstrap simulations with leverage
adjustments are used in order to create reliable critical values when causality
tests are conducted. The results of the asymmetric causality tests disclose
that the bear markets are causing the recessions as well as the bull markets
are causing the economic expansions. The causal effect of bull markets on
economic expansions is higher compared to the causal effect of bear markets on
economic recessions. In addition, it is found that economic expansions cause
bull markets but recessions do not cause bear markets. Thus, the policies that
remedy the falling financial markets can also help the economy when it is in a
recession.",Abdulnasser Hatemi-J,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01343v3,False,True,False,False,False,1942.0,Bryan A Stuart,Philadelphia,Active,,,"Recession, Economics, Financial market, Leverage (statistics), Volatility (finance), Causality (physics), Monetary economics, Capital market, Business cycle, Financial economics, Macroeconomics, Finance, Physics, Quantum mechanics, Machine learning, Computer science",,,
"Real implications of Quantitative Easing in the euro area: a
  complex-network perspective","The long-lasting socio-economic impact of the global financial crisis has
questioned the adequacy of traditional tools in explaining periods of financial
distress, as well as the adequacy of the existing policy response. In
particular, the effect of complex interconnections among financial institutions
on financial stability has been widely recognized. A recent debate focused on
the effects of unconventional policies aimed at achieving both price and
financial stability. In particular, Quantitative Easing (QE, i.e., the
large-scale asset purchase programme conducted by a central bank upon the
creation of new money) has been recently implemented by the European Central
Bank (ECB). In this context, two questions deserve more attention in the
literature. First, to what extent, by injecting liquidity, the QE may alter the
bank-firm lending level and stimulate the real economy. Second, to what extent
the QE may also alter the pattern of intra-financial exposures among financial
actors (including banks, investment funds, insurance corporations, and pension
funds) and what are the implications in terms of financial stability. Here, we
address these two questions by developing a methodology to map the
macro-network of financial exposures among institutional sectors across
financial instruments (e.g., equity, bonds, and loans) and we illustrate our
approach on recently available data (i.e., data on loans and private and public
securities purchased within the QE). We then test the effect of the
implementation of ECB's QE on the time evolution of the financial linkages in
the macro-network of the euro area, as well as the effect on macroeconomic
variables, such as output and prices.",Chiara Perillo; Stefano Battiston,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09418v1,False,True,False,False,False,1958.0,Rustom D Manouchehri Irani,UIUC,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-72150-7_94,"Quantitative easing, Financial system, Market liquidity, Equity (law), Business, Context (archaeology), Asset (computer security), Financial market participants, Economics, Financial instrument, Finance, Monetary policy, Financial intermediary, Monetary economics, Central bank, Indirect finance, Political science, Computer science, Paleontology, Computer security, Law, Biology",University of Zurich,"Department of Banking and Finance, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland","Department of Banking and Finance, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"
"An optimal life insurance policy in the investment-consumption problem
  in an incomplete market","This paper considers an optimal life insurance for a householder subject to
mortality risk. The household receives a wage income continuously, which is
terminated by unexpected (premature) loss of earning power or (planned and
intended) retirement, whichever happens first. In order to hedge the risk of
losing income stream by householder's unpredictable event, the household enters
a life insurance contract by paying a premium to an insurance company. The
household may also invest their wealth into a financial market. The problem is
to determine an optimal insurance/investment/consumption strategy in order to
maximize the expected total, discounted utility from consumption and terminal
wealth. To reflect a real-life situation better, we consider an incomplete
market where the householder cannot trade insurance contracts continuously. To
our best knowledge, such a model is new in the insurance and finance
literature. The case of exponential utilities is considered in detail to derive
an explicit solution. We also provide numerical experiments for that particular
case to illustrate our results.",Masahiko Egami; Hideki Iwaki,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.0195v2,False,True,False,False,False,1971.0,Maxwell Kellogg,Chicago,Active,,,"Consumption (sociology), Hedge, Life insurance, Investment (military), Economics, Order (exchange), Actuarial science, Insurance policy, Key person insurance, Expected utility hypothesis, General insurance, Auto insurance risk selection, Microeconomics, Business, Finance, Financial economics, Ecology, Social science, Sociology, Politics, Political science, Law, Biology",,,
Information consumption and size in firms,"Social and biological collectives need to exchange information to persist and
to function. This happens across internal networks, whose structure represents
static channels through which information flows. Less studied is the quantity
and variety of information transmitted. We characterize a part of the
information flow, the information going into organizations, primarily business
firms. We measure what firms read using a data set of hundreds of millions of
records of news articles accessed by employees across millions of firms. We
measure and relate quantitatively three essential aspects: reading volume,
reading variety, and firm size. First we compare volume with firm size, showing
that firms grow sublinearly with the volume of their reading. The scaling means
that inequality in information volume exaggerates the classic Zipf's law
inequality in firm size, pointing to an economy of scale in information
consumption. Then, by connecting variety and volume, we show that the firms
vary in their reading habits to a limited degree. Firms above a certain size
become repetitive readers, consistent with the sudden onset of a coordination
cost between teams, not individual employees. Finally, we relate information
variety to size to show that large firms tend to increase investments in
existing areas of interest instead of divesting from them to move to new areas.
We argue that this reflects structural constraints in growth. The results
indicate how information consumption reflects the role of internal structure,
beyond individual employees, analogous to information processing in other
social and biological systems.",Edward D. Lee; Alan P.

Real-Time Integrated Learning and Decision-Making for Asset Networks,"Problem definition: Unexpected component failures in industrial assets can
lead to significant financial losses and operational disruptions, making
preventive maintenance crucial for reducing unplanned downtime. This study
focuses on optimizing maintenance for economically coupled assets that degrade
according to a compound Poisson process, failing when degradation exceeds a
specified threshold. Degradation parameters vary across components and cannot
be directly observed, necessitating inference from real-time sensor data, with
maintenance limited to scheduled interventions. Academic/practical relevance:
We characterize optimal replacement policies that have access to the
degradation process parameters, which inform suitable initial policies for our
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. The effectiveness of the trained
policies is demonstrated through a case study on interventional X-ray systems.
Methodology: The maintenance optimization problem is modeled as a partially
observable Markov decision process (POMDP). To manage the inherent
computational complexity, we reformulate it as a Bayesian Markov decision
process (BMDP) using conjugate pairs. This allows us to extend the DRL
algorithm to BMDPs. Additionally, we propose an open-loop feedback approach to
adapt the DRL algorithm to the POMDP setting when a BMDP reformulation is
infeasible. Results: Numerical results indicate that our DRL algorithm
effectively reduces maintenance costs and unplanned downtime by leveraging
real-time data and shared setup costs to learn state-of-the-art complex
opportunistic maintenance policies. Managerial implications: Our approach
demonstrates how integrating real-time learning and decision-making can
significantly lower costs in industrial asset networks, providing a practical
solution for improving operational efficiency amidst asset heterogeneity and
economic dependence.",Peter Verleijsdonk; Collin Drent; Stella Kapodistria; Willem van Jaarsveld,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18246v1,False,True,False,False,False,1987.0,Kevin Mullally,Boston,Active,,https://doi.org/10.2307/3250961,"Knowledge management, Personal knowledge management, Business, Management science, Computer science, Process management, Organizational learning, Engineering",INSEAD; Texas Christian University; Emory University,"Emory university, Atlanta, GA; Texas Christian University, Fort Worth, Texas and INSEAD, France#TAB#","Emory university, Atlanta, GA; Texas Christian University, Fort Worth, Texas and INSEAD, France#TAB#"
"Kindergarden quantum mechanics graduates (...or how I learned to stop
  gluing LEGO together and love the ZX-calculus)","This paper is a `spiritual child' of the 2005 lecture notes Kindergarten
Quantum Mechanics, which showed how a simple, pictorial extension of Dirac
notation allowed several quantum features to be easily expressed and derived,
using language even a kindergartner can understand. Central to that approach
was the use of pictures and pictorial transformation rules to understand and
derive features of quantum theory and computation. However, this approach left
many wondering `where's the beef?' In other words, was this new approach
capable of producing new results, or was it simply an aesthetically pleasing
way to restate stuff we already know?
  The aim of this sequel paper is to say `here's the beef!', and highlight some
of the major results of the approach advocated in Kindergarten Quantum
Mechanics, and how they are being applied to tackle practical problems on real
quantum computers. We will focus mainly on what has become the Swiss army knife
of the pictorial formalism: the ZX-calculus. First we look at some of the ideas
behind the ZX-calculus, comparing and contrasting it with the usual quantum
circuit formalism. We then survey results from the past 2 years falling into
three categories: (1) completeness of the rules of the ZX-calculus, (2)
state-of-the-art quantum circuit optimisation results in commercial and
open-source quantum compilers relying on ZX, and (3) the use of ZX in
translating real-world stuff like natural language into quantum circuits that
can be run on today's (very limited) quantum hardware.
  We also take the title literally, and outline an ongoing experiment aiming to
show that ZX-calculus enables children to do cutting-edge quantum computing
stuff. If anything, this would truly confirm that `kindergarten quantum

"Interactive Digital Learning Materials for Kindergarten Students in

communication technology and it is necessary to develop interactive learning
materials for children that may improve their learning, catching, and
memorizing capabilities. Perhaps, one of the most important innovations in the
age of technology is multimedia and its application. It is imperative to create
high quality and realistic learning environment for children. Interactive
learning materials can be easier to understand and deal with their first
learning. We developed some interactive learning materials in the form of a
video for Playgroup using multimedia application tools. This study investigated
the impact of students' abilities to acquire new knowledge or skills through
interactive learning materials. We visited one kindergartens (Nursery schools),
interviewed class teachers about their teaching methods and level of students'
ability of recognizing English alphabets, pictures, etc. The course teachers
were provided interactive learning materials to show their playgroups for a
number of sessions. The video included English alphabets with related words and
pictures, and motivational fun. We noticed that almost all children were very
interested to interact with their leaning video. The students were assessed
individually and asked to recognize the alphabets, and pictures. The students
adapted with their first alphabets very quickly. However, there were individual
differences in their cognitive development. This interactive multimedia can be
an alternative to traditional pedagogy for teaching playgroups.",Md. Baharul Islam; Md.

"Function-on-Function Regression for the Identification of Epigenetic
  Regions Exhibiting Windows of Susceptibility to Environmental Exposures","The ability to identify time periods when individuals are most susceptible to
exposures, as well as the biological mechanisms through which these exposures
act, is of great public health interest. Growing evidence supports an
association between prenatal exposure to air pollution and epigenetic marks,
such as DNA methylation, but the timing and gene-specific effects of these
epigenetic changes are not well understood. Here, we present the first study
that aims to identify prenatal windows of susceptibility to air pollution
exposures in cord blood DNA methylation. In particular, we propose a
function-on-function regression model that leverages data from nearby DNA
methylation probes to identify epigenetic regions that exhibit windows of
susceptibility to ambient particulate matter less than 2.5 microns
(PM$_{2.5}$). By incorporating the covariance structure among both the
multivariate DNA methylation outcome and the time-varying exposure under study,
this framework yields greater power to detect windows of susceptibility and
greater control of false discoveries than methods that model probes
independently. We compare our method to a distributed lag model approach that
models DNA methylation in a probe-by-probe manner, both in simulation and by
application to motivating data from the Project Viva birth cohort. In two
epigenetic regions selected based on prior studies of air pollution effects on
epigenome-wide methylation, we identify windows of susceptibility to PM$_{2.5}$
exposure near the beginning and middle of the third trimester of pregnancy.",Michele Zemplenyi; Mark J. Meyer; Andres Cardenas; Marie-France Hivert; Sheryl L.

Geography of Emotion: Where in a City are People Happier?,"Location-sharing services were built upon people's desire to share their
activities and locations with others. By ""checking-in"" to a place, such as a
restaurant, a park, gym, or train station, people disclose where they are,
thereby providing valuable information about land use and utilization of
services in urban areas. This information may, in turn, be used to design
smarter, happier, more equitable cities. We use data from Foursquare
location-sharing service to identify areas within a major US metropolitan area
with many check-ins, i.e., areas that people like to use. We then use data from
the Twitter microblogging platform to analyze the properties of these areas.
Specifically, we have extracted a large corpus of geo-tagged messages, called
tweets, from a major metropolitan area and linked them US Census data through
their locations. This allows us to measure the sentiment expressed in tweets
that are posted from a specific area, and also use that area's demographic
properties in analysis. Our results reveal that areas with many check-ins are
different from other areas within the metropolitan region. In particular, these
areas have happier tweets, which also encourage people from other areas to
commute longer distances to these places. These findings shed light on human
mobility patterns, as well as how physical environment influences human
emotions.",Luciano Gallegos; Kristina Lerman; Arthur Huang; David Garcia,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07632v1,False,True,False,False,False,2050.0,Kyle E Walker,Dallas,Completed,2026.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1507.07632,"Metropolitan area, Microblogging, Geography, Census, Service (business), Social media, Advertising, Computer science, World Wide Web, Internet privacy, Business, Marketing, Sociology, Population, Demography, Archaeology",Tarleton State University; ETH Zurich; University of Southern California,"ETH Zurich Zurich Switzerland; Tarlenton State University, Stephenville, TX, USA; University of Southern California Los,Angeles,CA,USA","ETH Zurich Zurich Switzerland; Tarlenton State University, Stephenville, TX, USA; University of Southern California Los,Angeles,CA,USA"

Ambient Noise Full Waveform Inversion with Neural Operators,"Numerical simulations of seismic wave propagation are crucial for
investigating velocity structures and improving seismic hazard assessment.
However, standard methods such as finite difference or finite element are
computationally expensive. Recent studies have shown that a new class of
machine learning models, called neural operators, can solve the elastodynamic
wave equation orders of magnitude faster than conventional methods. Full
waveform inversion is a prime beneficiary of the accelerated simulations.
Neural operators, as end-to-end differentiable operators, combined with
automatic differentiation, provide an alternative approach to the adjoint-state
method. Since neural operators do not involve the Born approximation, when used
for full waveform inversion they have the potential to include additional
phases and alleviate cycle-skipping problems present in traditional
adjoint-state formulations. In this study, we demonstrate the first application

Dynamics of racial segregation and gentrification in New York City,"Racial residential segregation is interconnected with several other phenomena
such as income inequalities, property values inequalities, and racial
disparities in health and in education. Furthermore, recent literature suggests
the phenomena of gentrification as a cause of perpetuation or increase of
racial residential segregation in some American cities. In this paper, we
analyze the dynamics of racial residential segregation for white, black, Asian,
and Hispanic citizens in New York City in the years of 1990, 2000, and 2010. It
was possible to observe that segregation between white and Hispanic citizens,
and discrimination between white and Asian ones has grown, while segregation
between white and black is quite stable. Furthermore, we analyzed the per
capita income and the Gini coefficient in each segregated zone, showing that
the highest inequalities occur in the zones where there is overlap of
high-density zones of pair of races. Focusing on census tracts that have
changed density of population during these twenty years, and, particularly, by
analyzing white and black people's segregation, our analysis reveals that a
positive flux of white (black) people is associated to a substantial increase
(decrease) of the property values, as compared with the city mean. Furthermore,
by clustering the region of high density of black citizens, we measured the
variation of area and displacement of the four biggest clusters in the period
from 1990 to 2010. The large displacements (~ 1.6 Km) observed for two of these
clusters, namely, one in the neighborhood of Harlem and the other inside the
borough of Brooklyn, led to the emergence of typically gentrified regions.",Felipe G. Operti; André A. Moreira; Andrea Gabrielli; Hernan Makse; José S.

Labor Informality and Credit Market Accessibility,"The paper investigates the effects of the credit market development on the
labor mobility between the informal and formal labor sectors. In the case of
Russia, due to the absence of a credit score system, a formal lender may set a
credit limit based on the verified amount of income. To get a loan, an informal
worker must first formalize his or her income (switch to a formal job), and
then apply for a loan. To show this mechanism, the RLMS data was utilized, and
the empirical method is the dynamic multinomial logit model of employment. The
empirical results show that a relaxation of credit constraints increases the
probability of transition from an informal to a formal job, and improved CMA
(by one standard deviation) increases the chances of informal sector workers to
formalize by 5.4 ppt. These results are robust in different specifications of
the model. Policy simulations show strong support for a reduction in informal
employment in response to better CMA in credit-constrained communities.",Alina Malkova; Klara Sabirianova Peter; Jan Svejnar,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05803v1,False,True,False,False,False,2055.0,Manasa Gopal,Atlanta,Active,,https://doi.org/10.2307/1879431,"Mechanism (biology), Quality (philosophy), Business, Market mechanism, Economics, Industrial organization, Market economy, Physics, Quantum mechanics",,,

of detail needed to take key policy or business decisions. Thus, we propose an
evaluation framework that is cost-efficient for first capture and future
updates, and is reliable at the block level. The framework complements existing
work of using street view imagery combined with deep learning to automatically
extract building information to assist the identification of housing
characteristics. We then check its potential for scalability and higher level
reliability. For that purpose, we create an index, which synthesises the
highest possible level of granularity of data at the housing unit and at the
household level at the block level, and assess whether the predictions made by
our model could be used to approximate vulnerability conditions with a lower
budget and in selected areas. Our results indicated that the predictions from
the images are clearly correlated with the index.",Chaofeng Wang; Sarah Elizabeth Antos; Jessica Grayson Gosling Goldsmith; Luis Miguel Triveno,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14460v1,False,True,False,False,False,2061.0,Eileen Divringi,Philadelphia,Completed,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2205.14460,"Computer science, Index (typography), Vulnerability (computing), Quality (philosophy), Sample (material), Identification (biology), Work (physics), Key (lock), Computer security, Engineering, Mechanical engineering, Philosophy, Chemistry, Botany, Epistemology, Chromatography, World Wide Web, Biology",,,
"A Repairable System Supported by Two Spare Units and Serviced by Two
  Types of Repairers","We study a one-unit repairable system, supported by two identical spare units
on cold standby, and serviced by two types of repairers. The model applies, for
instance, to ANSI (American National Standard Institute) centrifugal pumps in a
chemical plant. The failed unit undergoes repair either by an in-house repairer
within a random or deterministic patience time, or else by a visiting expert
repairer. The expert repairs one or all failed units before leaving, and does
so faster but at a higher cost rate than the regular repairer. Four models
arise depending on the number of repairs done by the expert and the nature of
the patience time. We compare these models based on the limiting availability
$A_{\infty}$, and the limiting profit per unit time $\omega$, using semi-Markov
processes, when all distributions are exponential. As anticipated, to maximize
$A_{\infty}$, the expert should repair all failed units. To maximize $\omega$,
a suitably chosen deterministic patience time is better than a random patience
time. Furthermore, given all cost parameters, we determine the optimum number
of repairs the expert should complete, and the optimum patience time given to
the regular repairer in order to maximize $\omega$.",Vahid Andalib; Jyotirmoy Sarkar,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02547v1,False,True,False,False,False,2061.0,Eileen Divringi,Philadelphia,Completed,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.2991/jsta.d.210611.001,"Spare part, Patience, Limiting, Computer science, Reliability engineering, Unit (ring theory), Operations research, Operations management, Mathematics, Engineering, Mechanical engineering, Philosophy, Mathematics education, Theology","Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis; University of Maryland, Baltimore County","Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD 21250, USA; Department of Mathematical Sciences, Indiana Universiry-Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA","Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD 21250, USA; Department of Mathematical Sciences, Indiana Universiry-Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA"
"Prediction method of cigarette draw resistance based on correlation
  analysis","The cigarette draw resistance monitoring method is incomplete and single, and
the lacks correlation analysis and preventive modeling, resulting in
substandard cigarettes in the market. To address this problem without
increasing the hardware cost, in this paper, multi-indicator correlation
analysis is used to predict cigarette draw resistance. First, the monitoring
process of draw resistance is analyzed based on the existing quality control
framework, and optimization ideas are proposed. In addition, for the three
production units, the cut tobacco supply (VE), the tobacco rolling (SE), and
the cigarette-forming (MAX), direct and potential factors associated with draw
resistance are explored, based on the linear and non-linear correlation
analysis. Then, the correlates of draw resistance are used as inputs for the
machine learning model, and the predicted values of draw resistance are used as
outputs. Finally, this research also innovatively verifies the practical
application value of draw resistance prediction: the distribution
characteristics of substandard cigarettes are analyzed based on the prediction
results, the time interval of substandard cigarettes being produced is
determined, the probability model of substandard cigarettes being sampled is
derived, and the reliability of the prediction result is further verified by
the example. The results show that the prediction model based on correlation
analysis has good performance in three months of actual production.",Linsheng Chen; Zhonghua Yu; Bo Zhang; Qiang Zhu; Hu Fan; Yucan Qiu,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06649v1,False,True,False,False,False,2061.0,Eileen Divringi,Philadelphia,Completed,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2023.107808,"Reliability (semiconductor), Correlation, Resistance (ecology), Production (economics), Linear correlation, Statistics, Process (computing), Computer science, Econometrics, Mathematics, Economics, Ecology, Power (physics), Physics, Geometry, Macroeconomics, Quantum mechanics, Biology, Operating system",China Tobacco; Zhejiang University,"College of Mechanical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310030, China; Technology Center of China Tobacco Zhejiang Industrial Co.

"An income-based approach to modeling commuting distance in the Toronto
  area","The purpose of this article is to propose a novel model of the effects of
changes in shelter and driving costs on car commuting distances in the
overheated Toronto housing market from 2011 to 2016. The model borrows from
theoretical concepts of microeconomics and urban geography to examine the
Toronto housing market. Using 2011 and 2016 Census data for census metropolitan
areas (CMAs) and census agglomerations (CAs) in Southern Ontario and computed
driving costs, the model of car commuting distance is based on variables of
allocation of monthly household income to monthly shelter costs and driving
costs as a function of the car driving distance to Toronto. Using this model,
we can predict the effect on car commuting distance due to changes in any of
the variables. The model also offers an explanation for communities of Toronto
car commuters beyond a driving radius that we might expect for daily commuting.
The model confirms that increases in shelter costs in the Toronto housing
market from 2011 to 2016 have forced the boundaries of feasible housing
locations outward, and forced households to move farther away, thus increasing
car commuting distance.",Shawn Berry,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11343v1,False,True,False,False,False,2061.0,Eileen Divringi,Philadelphia,Completed,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rtbm.2021.100720,"Census, Metropolitan area, Urban agglomeration, Geography, Transport engineering, Distance decay, Economics, Demographic economics, Economic geography, Engineering, Sociology, Demography, Population, Archaeology",William Howard Taft University,"William Howard Taft University, USA","William Howard Taft University, USA"

"Nationwide frequency-dependent seismic site amplification models for
  Iceland","Seismic wave amplification due to localized site conditions is an important
aspect of regional seismic hazard assessment. Without systematic studies of
frequency-dependent site-effects during strong Icelandic earthquakes, various
local site proxies of large-scale studies in other seismic regions have been
used in Iceland. Recently, earthquake site-effects were rigorously quantified
for 34 stations in Southwest Iceland for the first time and correlated to
distinct Icelandic geological units of hard rock, rock, lava rock, and
sedimentary soil. These units are prevalent throughout Iceland and herein we
present 1) nationwide maps of proxies (slope, Vs30, geological units) that may
contribute to a better estimation of site effects and associated, 2)
frequency-dependent site-amplification maps of Iceland. The frequency-dependent
site factors for each geological unit are presented at 1-30 Hz and PGA.
Finally, we generate site amplification maps based on recent large-scale models
developed in other seismic regions (ESRM20) and various site proxies they are
based on (geology- and slope-based inferred Vs30, geomorphological sedimentary
thickness). We compare site-proxy maps and amplification maps from both
Icelandic and large-scale, non-Icelandic, models. Neither spatial patterns nor
amplification levels in either proxy or amplification maps from large-scale
non-Icelandic studies resemble those observed from local quantitative
strong-motion research as presented in this study. We attribute the discrepancy
primarily to the young geology of Iceland and its formation history.
Additionally, we compare model performance across frequencies by assessing the
bias of model predictions against empirical site amplifications in the South
Iceland Seismic Zone, accounting for site-to-site variability of residuals
indicating the superior performance of the local amplification model.",Atefe Darzi; Benedikt Halldorsson; Fabrice Cotton; Sahar Rahpeyma,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09338v1,False,True,False,False,False,2082.0,John D Iceland,Penn State,Completed,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soildyn.2024.108798,"Seismology, Geology",University of Twente; University of Iceland; University of Potsdam; GeoInformation (United Kingdom); GFZ Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences; Icelandic Meteorological Office,"Institute for Geosciences, University of Potsdam, Karl-Liebknecht-Str. 24-25, 14476 Potsdam, Germany; Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation, Department of Applied Earth Sciences, University of Twente, Enschede, Netherland; Volcanoes, Earthquakes & Deformation, Service and Research Division, Icelandic Meteorological Office, Reykjavík, Iceland; Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering, School of Engineering and Natural Sciences, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland (A.; Seismic Hazard and Risk Dynamics, Helmholtz Centre Potsdam -German Research Centre for Geosciences GFZ, Telegrafenberg, 14473 Potsdam, Germany","Institute for Geosciences, University of Potsdam, Karl-Liebknecht-Str. 24-25, 14476 Potsdam, Germany; Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation, Department of Applied Earth Sciences, University of Twente, Enschede, Netherland; Volcanoes, Earthquakes & Deformation, Service and Research Division, Icelandic Meteorological Office, Reykjavík, Iceland; Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering, School of Engineering and Natural Sciences, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland (A.; Seismic Hazard and Risk Dynamics, Helmholtz Centre Potsdam -German Research Centre for Geosciences GFZ, Telegrafenberg, 14473 Potsdam, Germany"
"Is it possible to obtain reliable estimates for the prevalence of anemia
  and childhood stunting among children under 5 in the poorest districts in
  Peru?","In this article we describe and apply the Fay-Herriot model with spatially
correlated random area effects (Pratesi, M., & Salvati, N. (2008)), in order to
predict the prevalence of anemia and childhood stunting in Peruvian districts,
based on the data from the Demographic and Family Health Survey of the year
2019, which collects data about anemia and childhood stunting for children
under the age of 12 years, and the National Census carried out in 2017. Our
main objective is to produce reliable predictions for the districts, where
sample sizes are too small to provide good direct estimates, and for the
districts, which were not included in the sample. The basic Fay-Herriot model
(Fay & Herriot, 1979) tackles this problem by incorporating auxiliary
information, which is generally available from administrative or census
records. The Fay-Herriot model with spatially correlated random area effects,
in addition to auxiliary information, incorporates geographic information about
the areas, such as latitude and longitude. This permits modeling spatial
autocorrelations, which are not unusual in socioeconomic and health surveys. To
evaluate the mean square error of the above-mentioned predictors, we use the
parametric bootstrap procedure, developed in Molina et al. (2009).",Anna Sikov; José Cerda-Hernández; Eduardo Haro,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04812v1,False,True,False,False,False,2086.0,Jan M Eberth,Triangle,Completed,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.31899/pgy11.1008,"Formative assessment, Realm, Developing country, Context (archaeology), Fertility, Reproductive health, Adolescent health, Work (physics), Psychology, Adolescent development, Developed country, Political science, Economic growth, Developmental psychology, Sociology, Population, Medicine, Geography, Demography, Economics, Mechanical engineering, Pedagogy, Archaeology, Engineering, Law, Nursing",,,
"Multi-time small-area estimation of oil and gas production capacities by
  Bayesian multilevel modeling","This paper presents a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach for estimating
well-level oil and gas production capacities across small geographic areas over
multiple time periods. Focusing on a basin, which is a geologically and
economically distinguishable drilling region, we model the production
capacities of its wells grouped by area and time. Regularizing our inferences
with priors, we model area-level and time-level variations as well as
well-level variations, incorporating lateral length, water usage, and sand
usage at each well. The Maidenhead Coordinate System is used to define uniform
geographic areas, many of which contain only a small number of wells in a given
time period. First, a Bayesian small-area model is built, using data from the
Bakken region from February 2012 to June 2024. Then, the model is expanded to
contain temporal dynamics in the production capacities. In addition to general
time components, water and sand usage intensities are modeled in estimating
production capabilities over time. We find the Bayesian multilevel modeling
approach provides a flexible and robust framework for modeling and estimating
oil and gas production capacities at area and time levels and for informing
area-time predictions with uncertainties.",Hiroaki Minato,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11167v5,False,True,False,False,False,2086.0,Jan M Eberth,Triangle,Completed,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2408.11167,"Small area estimation, Bayesian probability, Estimation, Production (economics), Bayes estimator, Environmental science, Bayesian hierarchical modeling, Econometrics, Bayesian inference, Statistics, Mathematics, Economics, Microeconomics, Management",,,
Innovation and imitation,"We study several models of growth driven by innovation and imitation by a
continuum of firms, focusing on the interaction between the two. We first
investigate a model on a technology ladder where innovation and imitation
combine to generate a balanced growth path (BGP) with compact support, and with
productivity distributions for firms that are truncated power-laws. We start
with a simple model where firms can adopt technologies of other firms with
higher productivities according to exogenous probabilities. We then study the
case where the adoption probabilities depend on the probability distribution of
productivities at each time. We finally consider models with a finite number of
firms, which by construction have firm productivity distributions with bounded
support. Stochastic imitation and innovation can make the distance of the
productivity frontier to the lowest productivity level fluctuate, and this
distance can occasionally become large. Alternatively, if we fix the length of
the support of the productivity distribution because firms too far from the
frontier cannot survive, the number of firms can fluctuate randomly.",Jess Benhabib; Éric Brunet; Mildred Hager,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06315v2,False,True,False,False,False,2095.0,Seula Kim,Baruch,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1108/00251741111094437,"Imitation, Organizational culture, Competitive advantage, Originality, Value (mathematics), Business, Organizational learning, Multilevel model, Marketing, Market orientation, Organizational performance, Knowledge management, Management, Economics, Psychology, Computer science, Creativity, Social psychology, Machine learning",Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Universidad de Murcia,"(Departmento Organización de Empresas y Finanzas, Faculty Economía y Empresa, Universidad de Murcia, Campus de Espinardo, Espinardo (Murcia), Spain); (Facultad de Administración, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Manizales, Colombia)","(Departmento Organización de Empresas y Finanzas, Faculty Economía y Empresa, Universidad de Murcia, Campus de Espinardo, Espinardo (Murcia), Spain); (Facultad de Administración, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Manizales, Colombia)"

Civic Engagement among Early Internet Adopters: Trend or Phase?,"This paper brings evidence to bear on the question of the long-term effects
of Internet diffusion on civic engagement in geographic communities. It draws
on findings from survey data collected in four U.S. towns and cities in fall
2000 where community computer networking is established. The study shows that
early adopters of the Internet are more likely to engage in civic activities
and to have higher levels of community involvement than later adopters.
Further, early adopters are more likely to use the Internet to increase their
community involvement and political participation. Later adopters in all four
sites show less involvement in their local community and less interest in
political activity and information, online or offline. These findings reinforce
those of the Kohut (1999) study showing that later adopters are less civic
minded and more interested than early adopters in consumer and commercial
applications, such as shopping and entertainment. The evidence in these four
sites is consistent with earlier findings in Blacksburg, Virginia (Kavanaugh,
2000; Patterson and Kavanaugh, 2001; Kavanaugh and Patterson, 2001) and other
studies of early innovation adopters (Rogers, 1983; Kohut, 1999; Valente, 1995,
among others). The results reported in this paper lend weight to the argument
that increases in civic engagement and community involvement are due primarily
to the behavior of early adopters, making such increases a phase, not a trend.
As later adopters come on line, use of the Internet for community involvement
or civic engagement decreases. In the long term, we can expect that Internet
access may have only a modest effect on community involvement and civic
engagement in geographic communities.",Andrea L.

unique challenges as they must build their own communities while simultaneously
disrupting others. However, little is known about how political trolls mobilize
sufficient participation to suddenly become problems for others. We performed a
quantitative longitudinal analysis of more than 16 million comments from one of
the most popular and disruptive political trolling communities, the subreddit

collective action within these deviant spaces. In specific, we first study the
characteristics of the most active participants to uncover what might drive
their sustained participation. Next, we investigate how these active
individuals mobilize their community to action. Through our analysis, we
uncover that the most active employed distinct discursive strategies to
mobilize participation, and deployed technical tools like bots to create a

technologies in an effort to improve government services. One such innovation
in e-government is the creation of 311 systems, offering a centralized platform
where citizens can request services, report non-emergency concerns, and obtain
information about the city via hotline, mobile, or web-based applications. The
NYC 311 service request system represents one of the most significant links
between citizens and city government, accounting for more than 8,000,000
requests annually. These systems are generating massive amounts of data that,
when properly managed, cleaned, and mined, can yield significant insights into
the real-time condition of the city. Increasingly, these data are being used to
develop predictive models of citizen concerns and problem conditions within the
city. However, predictive models trained on these data can suffer from biases
in the propensity to make a request that can vary based on socio-economic and
demographic characteristics of an area, cultural differences that can affect
citizens' willingness to interact with their government, and differential
access to Internet connectivity. Using more than 20,000,000 311 requests -

edge in quantitative finance. However, there is a steep development curve for
quantitative traders to obtain an agent that automatically positions to win in

debugging. In this paper, we present the first open-source framework
\textit{FinRL} as a full pipeline to help quantitative traders overcome the

"Firm-level supply chains to minimize unemployment and economic losses in
  rapid decarbonization scenarios","Urgently needed carbon emissions reductions might lead to strict
command-and-control decarbonization strategies with potentially negative
economic consequences. Analysing the entire firm-level production network of a
European economy, we have explored how the worst outcomes of such approaches
can be avoided. We compared the systemic relevance of every firm in Hungary
with its annual CO2 emissions to identify optimal emission-reducing strategies
with a minimum of additional unemployment and economic losses. Setting specific
reduction targets, we studied various decarbonization scenarios and quantified
their economic consequences. We determined that for an emissions reduction of
20%, the most effective strategy leads to losses of about 2% of jobs and 2% of
economic output. In contrast, a naive scenario targeting the largest emitters
first results in 28% job losses and 33% output reduction for the same target.
This demonstrates that it is possible to use firm-level production networks to
design highly effective decarbonization strategies that practically preserve
employment and economic output.",Johannes Stangl; András Borsos; Christian Diem; Tobias Reisch; Stefan Thurner,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08987v3,False,True,False,False,False,2127.0,Henry Friedman,UCLA,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-024-01321-x,"Prosperity, Unemployment, Production (economics), Economics, Sustainability, Reduction (mathematics), Low-carbon economy, Greenhouse gas, Natural resource economics, Microeconomics, Economic growth, Ecology, Geometry, Mathematics, Biology",Complexity Science Hub Vienna,"Complexity Science Hub Vienna, Vienna, Austria","Complexity Science Hub Vienna, Vienna, Austria"
Asset Prices and Risk Aversion,"The standard asset pricing models (the CCAPM and the Epstein-Zin non-expected
utility model) counterintuitively predict that equilibrium asset prices can
rise if the representative agent's risk aversion increases. If the income
effect, which implies enhanced saving as a result of an increase in risk
aversion, dominates the substitution effect, which causes the representative
agent to reallocate his portfolio in favour of riskless assets, the demand for
securities increases. Thus, asset prices are forced to rise when the
representative agent is more risk adverse. By disentangling risk aversion and
intertemporal substituability, we demonstrate that the risky asset price is an
increasing function of the coefficient of risk aversion only if the elasticity
of intertemporal substitution (EIS) exceeds unity. This result, which was first
proved par Epstein (1988) in a stationary economy setting with a constant risk
aversion, is shown to hold true for non-stationary economies with a variable or
constant risk aversion coefficient. The conclusion is that the EIS probably
exceeds unity.",Dominique Pepin,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0851v1,False,True,False,False,False,2128.0,Benjamin Iverson,Utah,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1964.tb02865.x,"Economics, Diversification (marketing strategy), Interest rate, Security market line, Capital asset pricing model, Asset (computer security), Financial economics, Capital market, Risk premium, Microeconomics, Econometrics, Monetary economics, Finance, Business, Stock market, Context (archaeology), Paleontology, Computer security, Computer science, Biology, Marketing",,,
Ambiguous volatility and asset pricing in continuous time,"This paper formulates a model of utility for a continuous time framework that
captures the decision-maker's concern with ambiguity about both volatility and
drift. Corresponding extensions of some basic results in asset pricing theory
are presented. First, we derive arbitrage-free pricing rules based on hedging
arguments. Ambiguous volatility implies market incompleteness that rules out
perfect hedging. Consequently, hedging arguments determine prices only up to
intervals. However, sharper predictions can be obtained by assuming preference
maximization and equilibrium. Thus we apply the model of utility to a
representative agent endowment economy to study equilibrium asset returns. A
version of the C-CAPM is derived and the effects of ambiguous volatility are
described.",Larry G.

Optimal pricing for carbon dioxide removal under inter-regional leakage,"Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) moves atmospheric carbon to geological or
land-based sinks. In a first-best setting, the optimal use of CDR is achieved
by a removal subsidy that equals the optimal carbon tax and marginal damages.
We derive second-best policy rules for CDR subsidies and carbon taxes when no
global carbon price exists but a national government implements a unilateral
climate policy. We find that the optimal carbon tax differs from an optimal CDR
subsidy because of carbon leakage and a balance of resource trade effect.
First, the optimal removal subsidy tends to be larger than the carbon tax
because of lower supply-side leakage on fossil resource markets. Second, net
carbon exporters exacerbate this wedge to increase producer surplus of their
carbon resource producers, implying even larger removal subsidies. Third, net
carbon importers may set their removal subsidy even below their carbon tax when
marginal environmental damages are small, to appropriate producer surplus from
carbon exporters.",Max Franks; Matthias Kalkuhl; Kai Lessmann,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09299v1,False,True,False,False,False,2129.0,Rebecca Lester,Stanford,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2022.102769,"Subsidy, Carbon tax, Natural resource economics, Damages, Carbon sink, Carbon sequestration, Carbon leakage, Economics, Carbon dioxide, Greenhouse gas, Carbon fibers, Leakage (economics), Deadweight loss, Emissions trading, Environmental science, Climate change, Welfare, Chemistry, Ecology, Materials science, Organic chemistry, Political science, Law, Market economy, Composite material, Biology, Macroeconomics, Composite number",University of Potsdam; Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research; Technische Universität Berlin; Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change,"Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change, Germany; Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences, University of Potsdam, Germany; Technische Universität Berlin, Germany; Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, P.O.

"Time-warped growth processes, with applications to the modeling of
  boom-bust cycles in house prices","House price increases have been steady over much of the last 40 years, but
there have been occasional declines, most notably in the recent housing bust
that started around 2007, on the heels of the preceding housing bubble. We
introduce a novel growth model that is motivated by time-warping models in
functional data analysis and includes a nonmonotone time-warping component that
allows the inclusion and description of boom-bust cycles and facilitates
insights into the dynamics of asset bubbles. The underlying idea is to model
longitudinal growth trajectories for house prices and other phenomena, where
temporal setbacks and deflation may be encountered, by decomposing such
trajectories into two components. A first component corresponds to underlying
steady growth driven by inflation that anchors the observed trajectories on a
simple first order linear differential equation, while a second boom-bust
component is implemented as time warping. Time warping is a commonly
encountered phenomenon and reflects random variation along the time axis. Our
approach to time warping is more general than previous approaches by admitting
the inclusion of nonmonotone warping functions. The anchoring of the
trajectories on an underlying linear dynamic system also makes the time-warping
component identifiable and enables straightforward estimation procedures for
all model components. The application to the dynamics of housing prices as
observed for 19 metropolitan areas in the U.S. from December 1998 to July 2013
reveals that the time setbacks corresponding to nonmonotone time warping vary
substantially across markets and we find indications that they are related to
market-specific growth rates.",Jie Peng; Debashis Paul; Hans-Georg Müller,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5497v1,False,True,False,False,False,2133.0,Jose Carreno-Garcia,Berkeley,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1214/14-aoas740,"Bust, Image warping, Boom, Econometrics, Inflation (cosmology), Component (thermodynamics), Economics, Computer science, Engineering, Artificial intelligence, Physics, Environmental engineering, Theoretical physics, Thermodynamics","University of California, Davis; SHIELDS for Families","DEPARTMENT OF STATISTICS UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS ONE SHIELDS AVENUE DAVIS, CALIFORNIA 95616 USA; University of California, Davis","DEPARTMENT OF STATISTICS UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS ONE SHIELDS AVENUE DAVIS, CALIFORNIA 95616 USA; University of California, Davis"
"Multidimensional Skills as a Measure of Human Capital: Evidence from
  LinkedIn Profiles","We measure human capital using the self-reported skill sets of 8.75 million
U.S. college graduates from professional profiles on the online platform
LinkedIn. We establish that these skills are systematically related to human
capital investments such as different types of schooling and work experience.
The average profile of the number of reported skills by age looks remarkably
similar to the well-established concave age-earnings profiles. More experienced
workers and those with higher educational degrees have larger shares of
occupation-specific skills, consistent with their acquisition through
professional-degree programs and on-the-job experience. Workers who report
more, and particularly more specific and managerial, skills are more likely to
hold highly paid jobs. Skill differences across workers can account for more
earnings variation than detailed vectors of education and experience. We also
document a substantial gender gap in reported skills, which starts to manifest
when young women reach typical ages of first motherhood. Gender differences in
skill profiles can rationalize a substantial proportion of the gender gap in
the propensity to work in highly paid jobs. Overall, the results are consistent
with an important role of multidimensional skills in accounting for several
well-known basic labor-market patterns.",David Dorn; Florian Schoner; Moritz Seebacher; Lisa Simon; Ludger Woessmann,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18638v1,False,True,False,False,False,2136.0,Sarah Hamersma,Cornell,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2409.18638,"Measure (data warehouse), Human capital, Business, Psychology, Knowledge management, Data science, Computer science, Economics, Data mining, Economic growth",,,
Incentive-Aware Models of Financial Networks,"Financial networks help firms manage risk but also enable financial shocks to
spread. Despite their importance, existing models of financial networks have
several limitations. Prior works often consider a static network with a simple
structure (e.g., a ring) or a model that assumes conditional independence
between edges. We propose a new model where the network emerges from
interactions between heterogeneous utility-maximizing firms. Edges correspond
to contract agreements between pairs of firms, with the contract size being the
edge weight. We show that, almost always, there is a unique ""stable network.""
All edge weights in this stable network depend on all firms' beliefs.
Furthermore, firms can find the stable network via iterative pairwise
negotiations. When beliefs change, the stable network changes. We show that
under realistic settings, a regulator cannot pin down the changed beliefs that
caused the network changes. Also, each firm can use its view of the network to
inform its beliefs. For instance, it can detect outlier firms whose beliefs
deviate from their peers. But it cannot identify the deviant belief: increased
risk-seeking is indistinguishable from increased expected profits. Seemingly
minor news may settle the dilemma, triggering significant changes in the
network.",Akhil Jalan; Deepayan Chakrabarti; Purnamrita Sarkar,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06808v3,False,True,False,False,False,2154.0,Yao Liu,Baruch,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2022.0678,"Incentive, CONTEST, Business, Competition (biology), Negotiation, Contract management, Microeconomics, TRACE (psycholinguistics), Finance, Industrial organization, Economics, Marketing, Ecology, Linguistics, Philosophy, Political science, Law, Biology",The University of Texas at Austin,"Department of Statistics and Data Science, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712; McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712;; Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712;","Department of Statistics and Data Science, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712; McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712;; Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712;"
Observed mobility behavior data reveal social distancing inertia,"The research team has utilized an integrated dataset, consisting of
anonymized location data, COVID-19 case data, and census population
information, to study the impact of COVID-19 on human mobility. The study
revealed that statistics related to social distancing, namely trip rate, miles
traveled per person, and percentage of population staying at home have all
showed an unexpected trend, which we named social distancing inertia. The
trends showed that as soon as COVID-19 cases were observed, the statistics
started improving, regardless of government actions. This suggests that a
portion of population who could and were willing to practice social distancing
voluntarily and naturally reacted to the emergence of COVID-19 cases. However,
after about two weeks, the statistics saturated and stopped improving, despite
the continuous rise in COVID-19 cases. The study suggests that there is a
natural behavior inertia toward social distancing, which puts a limit on the
extent of improvement in the social-distancing-related statistics. The national
data showed that the inertia phenomenon is universal, happening in all the U.S.
states and for all the studied statistics. The U.S. states showed a

"Automated Identification of Eviction Status from Electronic Health
  Record Notes","Objective: Evictions are important social and behavioral determinants of
health. Evictions are associated with a cascade of negative events that can
lead to unemployment, housing insecurity/homelessness, long-term poverty, and
mental health problems. In this study, we developed a natural language
processing system to automatically detect eviction status from electronic
health record (EHR) notes.
  Materials and Methods: We first defined eviction status (eviction presence
and eviction period) and then annotated eviction status in 5000 EHR notes from
the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). We developed a novel model, KIRESH,
that has shown to substantially outperform other state-of-the-art models such
as fine-tuning pre-trained language models like BioBERT and BioClinicalBERT.
Moreover, we designed a novel prompt to further improve the model performance
by using the intrinsic connection between the two sub-tasks of eviction
presence and period prediction. Finally, we used the Temperature Scaling-based
Calibration on our KIRESH-Prompt method to avoid over-confidence issues arising
from the imbalance dataset.
  Results: KIRESH-Prompt substantially outperformed strong baseline models
including fine-tuning the BioClinicalBERT model to achieve 0.74672 MCC, 0.71153
Macro-F1, and 0.83396 Micro-F1 in predicting eviction period and 0.66827 MCC,
0.62734 Macro-F1, and 0.7863 Micro-F1 in predicting eviction presence. We also
conducted additional experiments on a benchmark social determinants of health
(SBDH) dataset to demonstrate the generalizability of our methods.
  Conclusion and Future Work: KIRESH-Prompt has substantially improved eviction
status classification. We plan to deploy KIRESH-Prompt to the VHA EHRs as an
eviction surveillance system to help address the US Veterans' housing
insecurity.",Zonghai Yao; Jack Tsai; Weisong Liu; David A.

Whack-a-Chip: The Futility of Hardware-Centric Export Controls,"U.S. export controls on semiconductors are widely known to be permeable, with

Tencent, are not only using chips that are restricted under U.S. export
controls but are also finding ways to circumvent these regulations by using
software and modeling techniques that maximize less capable hardware.
Specifically, we argue that Tencent's ability to power its Hunyuan-Large model

"Hiring in the substance use disorder treatment related sector during the
  first five years of Medicaid expansion","Effective treatment strategies exist for substance use disorder (SUD),
however severe hurdles remain in ensuring adequacy of the SUD treatment (SUDT)
workforce as well as improving SUDT affordability, access and stigma. Although
evidence shows recent increases in SUD medication access from expanding
Medicaid availability under the Affordable Care Act, it is yet unknown whether
these policies also led to a growth in the changes in the nature of hiring in
SUDT related workforce, partly due to poor data availability. Our study uses
novel data to shed light on recent trends in a fast-evolving and
policy-relevant labor market, and contributes to understanding the current SUDT
related workforce and the effect of Medicaid expansion on hiring attempts in
this sector. We examine attempts over 2010-2018 at hiring in the SUDT and
related behavioral health sector as background for estimating the causal effect
of the 2014-and-beyond state Medicaid expansion on these outcomes through
""difference-in-difference"" econometric models. We use Burning Glass
Technologies (BGT) data covering virtually all U.S. job postings by employers.
Nationally, we find little growth in the sector's hiring attempts in 2010-2018
relative to the rest of the economy or to health care as a whole. However, this
masks diverging trends in subsectors, which saw reduction in hospital based
hiring attempts, increases towards outpatient facilities, and changes in

A graph-based multimodal framework to predict gentrification,"Gentrification--the transformation of a low-income urban area caused by the
influx of affluent residents--has many revitalizing benefits. However, it also
poses extremely concerning challenges to low-income residents. To help
policymakers take targeted and early action in protecting low-income residents,
researchers have recently proposed several machine learning models to predict
gentrification using socioeconomic and image features. Building upon previous
studies, we propose a novel graph-based multimodal deep learning framework to
predict gentrification based on urban networks of tracts and essential
facilities (e.g., schools, hospitals, and subway stations). We train and test
the proposed framework using data from Chicago, New York City, and Los Angeles.
The model successfully predicts census-tract level gentrification with 0.9

Ownership Chains in Multinational Enterprises,"This study examines how multinational enterprises (MNEs) structure ownership
chains to coordinate subsidiaries across multiple national borders. Using a
unique global dataset, we first document key stylized facts: 54% of
subsidiaries are controlled through indirect ownership, and ownership chains
can span up to seven countries. In particular, we find that subsidiaries
further down the hierarchy tend to be more geographically distant from the
parent and often operate in different time zones. This suggests that the ease
of communication along ownership chains is a critical determinant of their
structure. Motivated by these findings, we develop a location choice model in
which parent firms compete for corporate control of final subsidiaries. When
monitoring is costly, they may delegate control to an intermediate affiliate in
another jurisdiction. The model generates a two-stage empirical strategy: (i) a
trilateral equation that determines the location of an intermediate affiliate
conditional on the location of final subsidiaries; and (ii) a bilateral
equation that predicts the location of final investment. Our empirical
estimates confirm that the ease of communication at the country level
significantly influences the location decisions of affiliates along ownership
chains. These findings underscore the importance of organizational frictions in
shaping global corporate structures and provide new insights into the geography
of multinational ownership networks.",Stefania Miricola; Armando Rungi; Gianluca Santoni,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12857v2,False,True,False,False,False,2214.0,Nicolas Crouzet,Chicago,Active,,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4474239,"Multinational corporation, Business, Industrial organization, Commerce, Finance",Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca,Scuola IMT Alti Studi Lucca; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca - Analysis of Complex Economic Systems Unit; Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Info.

"A Non-Intrusive and Context-Based Vulnerability Scoring Framework for
  Cloud Services","Understanding the severity of vulnerabilities within cloud services is
particularly important for today service administrators.Although many systems,
e.g., CVSS, have been built to evaluate and score the severity of
vulnerabilities for administrators, the scoring schemes employed by these
systems fail to take into account the contextual information of specific
services having these vulnerabilities, such as what roles they play in a
particular service. Such a deficiency makes resulting scores unhelpful. This
paper presents a practical framework, NCVS, that offers automatic and
contextual scoring mechanism to evaluate the severity of vulnerabilities for a
particular service. Specifically, for a given service S, NCVS first
automatically collects S contextual information including topology,
configurations, vulnerabilities and their dependencies. Then, NCVS uses the
collected information to build a contextual dependency graph, named CDG, to
model S context. Finally, NCVS scores and ranks all the vulnerabilities in S by
analyzing S context, such as what roles the vulnerabilities play in S, and how
critical they affect the functionality of S. NCVS is novel and useful, because
1) context-based vulnerability scoring results are highly relevant and
meaningful for administrators to understand each vulnerability importance
specific to the target service; and 2) the workflow of NCVS does not need

"Victim or Perpetrator? Analysis of Violent Characters Portrayals from
  Movie Scripts","Violent content in the media can influence viewers' perception of the
society. For example, frequent depictions of certain demographics as victims or
perpetrators of violence can shape stereotyped attitudes. We propose that
computational methods can aid in the large-scale analysis of violence in
movies. The method we develop characterizes aspects of violent content solely
from the language used in the scripts. Thus, our method is applicable to a
movie in the earlier stages of content creation even before it is produced.
This is complementary to previous works which rely on audio or video post
production. In this work, we identify stereotypes in character roles (i.e.,
victim, perpetrator and narrator) based on the demographics of the actor casted
for that role. Our results highlight two significant differences in the
frequency of portrayals as well as the demographics of the interaction between
victims and perpetrators : (1) female characters appear more often as victims,
and (2) perpetrators are more likely to be White if the victim is Black or
Latino. To date, we are the first to show that language used in movie scripts
is a strong indicator of violent content, and that there are systematic
portrayals of certain demographics as victims and perpetrators in a large
dataset. This offers novel computational tools to assist in creating awareness
of representations in storytelling",Victor R Martinez; Krishna Somandepalli; Karan Singla; Anil Ramanakrishna; Yalda T.

Resurgence analysis of the Adler function at order $1/N_f^2$,"We compute non-perturbative contributions to the Adler function, the
derivative of the vacuum polarization function in gauge theory, using
resurgence methods and Borel-summed gauge field propagators. At 2-loop, to
order $1/N_f$, we construct the full 2-parameter transseries and perform the
sum over the non-perturbative sectors. We then introduce a convolution-based
method to derive the transseries structure of product series, which can also be
used to study higher orders in the expansion in $1/N_f$. We compute 3-loop
planar diagrams, at order $1/N_f^2$, and for each diagram study the asymptotic
behavior and resulting non-perturbative information in the transseries. A
structure emerges that, from a resurgence point of view, is quite different
from toy models hitherto studied. We study in particular the first and second
non-perturbative sectors, their relation to UV and IR renormalons, and how
their presence influences the perturbative expansions in neighbouring sectors.
Finally, finding that many non-perturbative sectors have asymptotic series, we
derive relations among all of them, thus providing an interesting new
perspective on the alien lattice for the Adler function.",Eric Laenen; Coenraad Marinissen; Marcel Vonk,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13715v2,False,True,False,False,False,2222.0,Coenraad Pinkse,Penn State,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2302.13715,"Propagator, Resummation, Lattice (music), Order (exchange), Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics), Asymptotic expansion, Physics, Gauge theory, Mathematical physics, Mathematics, Quantum mechanics, Mathematical analysis, Quantum chromodynamics, Finance, Acoustics, Economics",,,
On margin-based generalization prediction in deep neural networks,"Understanding generalization in deep neural networks is an active area of
research. A promising avenue of exploration has been that of margin
measurements: the shortest distance to the decision boundary for a given sample
or that sample's representation internal to the network. Margin-based
complexity measures have been shown to be correlated with the generalization
ability of deep neural networks in some circumstances but not others. The
reasons behind the success or failure of these metrics are currently unclear.
In this study, we examine margin-based generalization prediction methods in
different settings. We motivate why these metrics sometimes fail to accurately
predict generalization and how they can be improved.
  First, we analyze the relationship between margins measured in the input
space and sample noise. We find that different types of sample noise can have a
very different effect on the overall margin of a network that has modeled noisy
data.
  Following this, we empirically evaluate how robust margins measured at
different representational spaces are at predicting generalization. We find
that these metrics have several limitations and that a large margin does not
exhibit a strong correlation with empirical risk in many cases.
  Finally, we introduce a new margin-based measure that incorporates an
approximation of the underlying data manifold. It is empirically demonstrated
that this measure is generally more predictive of generalization than all other
margin-based measures. Furthermore, we find that this measurement also
outperforms other contemporary complexity measures on a well-known
generalization prediction benchmark. In addition, we analyze the utility and
limitations of this approach and find that this metric is well aligned with
intuitions expressed in prior work.",Coenraad Mouton,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17445v1,False,True,False,False,False,2222.0,Coenraad Pinkse,Penn State,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1109/taslp.2015.2505415,"Computer science, Boosting (machine learning), Classifier (UML), Artificial intelligence, Speech recognition, Artificial neural network, Pattern recognition (psychology), Machine learning, Background noise, Ensemble learning, Telecommunications",The Ohio State University,"Department of Computer Science & Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA","Department of Computer Science & Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"
Sorting with Teams,"We fully solve a sorting problem with heterogeneous firms and multiple
heterogeneous workers whose skills are imperfect substitutes. We show that
optimal sorting, which we call mixed and countermonotonic, is comprised of two
regions. In the first region, mediocre firms sort with mediocre workers and
coworkers such that the output losses are equal across all these teams
(mixing). In the second region, a high skill worker sorts with low skill
coworkers and a high productivity firm (countermonotonicity). We characterize
the equilibrium wages and firm values. Quantitatively, our model can generate
the dispersion of earnings within and across US firms.",Job Boerma; Aleh Tsyvinski; Alexander P.

Integer Subspace Differential Privacy,"We propose new differential privacy solutions for when external
\emph{invariants} and \emph{integer} constraints are simultaneously enforced on
the data product. These requirements arise in real world applications of
private data curation, including the public release of the 2020 U.S. Decennial
Census. They pose a great challenge to the production of provably private data
products with adequate statistical usability. We propose \emph{integer subspace
differential privacy} to rigorously articulate the privacy guarantee when data
products maintain both the invariants and integer characteristics, and
demonstrate the composition and post-processing properties of our proposal. To
address the challenge of sampling from a potentially highly restricted discrete
space, we devise a pair of unbiased additive mechanisms, the generalized
Laplace and the generalized Gaussian mechanisms, by solving the Diophantine
equations as defined by the constraints. The proposed mechanisms have good
accuracy, with errors exhibiting sub-exponential and sub-Gaussian tail
probabilities respectively. To implement our proposal, we design an MCMC
algorithm and supply empirical convergence assessment using estimated upper
bounds on the total variation distance via $L$-lag coupling. We demonstrate the
efficacy of our proposal with applications to a synthetic problem with
intersecting invariants, a sensitive contingency table with known margins, and
the 2010 Census county-level demonstration data with mandated fixed state

"Small domain estimation of census coverage: A case study in Bayesian
  analysis of complex survey data","Many countries conduct a full census survey to report official population
statistics. As no census survey ever achieves 100 per cent response rate, a
post-enumeration survey (PES) is usually conducted and analysed to assess
census coverage and produce official population estimates by geographic area
and demographic attributes. Considering the usually small size of PES, direct
estimation at the desired level of disaggregation is not feasible. Design-based
estimation with sampling weight adjustment is a commonly used method but is
difficult to implement when survey non-response patterns cannot be fully
documented and population benchmarks are not available. We overcome these
limitations with a fully model-based Bayesian approach applied to the New
Zealand PES. Although theory for the Bayesian treatment of complex surveys has
been described, published applications of individual level Bayesian models for
complex survey data remain scarce. We provide such an application through a
case study of the 2018 census and PES surveys. We implement a multilevel model
that accounts for the complex design of PES. We then illustrate how mixed
posterior predictive checking and cross-validation can assist with model
building and model selection. Finally, we discuss potential methodological
improvements to the model and potential solutions to mitigate dependence
between the two surveys.",Joane S. Elleouet; Patrick Graham; Nikolai Kondratev; Abby K. Morgan; Rebecca M.

The Distributional Effects of Economic Uncertainty,"We study the distributional implications of uncertainty shocks by developing
a model that links macroeconomic aggregates to the US distribution of earnings
and consumption. We find that: initially, the fraction of low-earning workers
decreases, while the share of households reporting low consumption increases;
at longer horizons, the fraction of low-income workers increases, but the
consumption distribution reverts to its pre-shock shape. While the first phase
reduces income inequality and increases consumption inequality, in the second
stage income inequality rises, while the effects on consumption inequality
dissipate. Finally, we introduce Functional Local Projections and show that
they yield similar results.",Florian Huber; Massimiliano Marcellino; Tommaso Tornese,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12655v1,False,True,False,False,False,2229.0,Jiashuo Feng,Utah,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1890/04-0922,"Biodiversity, Ecosystem, Ecosystem services, Ecology, Environmental resource management, Ecosystem management, Abundance (ecology), Abiotic component, Biology, Environmental science",Université Joseph Fourier; Western Washington University; University of Notre Dame; Manaaki Whenua – Landcare Research; Columbia University; University of Zurich; US Forest Service; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique; Centre d'Etudes Biologiques de Chizé; University of Helsinki; University of Michigan–Ann Arbor; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Natural Environment Research Council; University of Alaska Fairbanks; École Normale Supérieure - PSL; United States Geological Survey,"U.S. Geological Survey, Mount Rushmore National Memorial, 13000 Highway 244, Keystone, South Dakota 57751 USA; Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry, Pacific Southwest Research Station, USDA Forest Service, 1151 Punchbowl Street, Room 323, Honolulu, Hawaii 96813 USA; Laboratoire d'Ecologie Alpine, CNRS UMR 5553, Université J.

LFS-GAN: Lifelong Few-Shot Image Generation,"We address a challenging lifelong few-shot image generation task for the
first time. In this situation, a generative model learns a sequence of tasks
using only a few samples per task. Consequently, the learned model encounters
both catastrophic forgetting and overfitting problems at a time. Existing
studies on lifelong GANs have proposed modulation-based methods to prevent
catastrophic forgetting. However, they require considerable additional
parameters and cannot generate high-fidelity and diverse images from limited
data. On the other hand, the existing few-shot GANs suffer from severe
catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks. To alleviate these
issues, we propose a framework called Lifelong Few-Shot GAN (LFS-GAN) that can
generate high-quality and diverse images in lifelong few-shot image generation
task. Our proposed framework learns each task using an efficient task-specific
modulator - Learnable Factorized Tensor (LeFT). LeFT is rank-constrained and
has a rich representation ability due to its unique reconstruction technique.
Furthermore, we propose a novel mode seeking loss to improve the diversity of
our model in low-data circumstances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed LFS-GAN can generate high-fidelity and diverse images without any
forgetting and mode collapse in various domains, achieving state-of-the-art in
lifelong few-shot image generation task. Surprisingly, we find that our LFS-GAN
even outperforms the existing few-shot GANs in the few-shot image generation
task.

"Lifelong Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Framework Based on Generative
  Replay","Accurate trajectory prediction of vehicles is essential for reliable
autonomous driving. To maintain consistent performance as a vehicle driving
around different cities, it is crucial to adapt to changing traffic
circumstances and achieve lifelong trajectory prediction model. To realize it,
catastrophic forgetting is a main problem to be addressed. In this paper, a
divergence measurement method based on conditional Kullback-Leibler divergence
is proposed first to evaluate spatiotemporal dependency difference among varied
driving circumstances. Then based on generative replay, a novel lifelong
vehicle trajectory prediction framework is developed. The framework consists of
a conditional generation model and a vehicle trajectory prediction model. The
conditional generation model is a generative adversarial network conditioned on
position configuration of vehicles. After learning and merging trajectory
distribution of vehicles across different cities, the generation model replays
trajectories with prior samplings as inputs, which alleviates catastrophic
forgetting. The vehicle trajectory prediction model is trained by the replayed
trajectories and achieves consistent prediction performance on visited cities.
A lifelong experiment setup is established on four open datasets including five
tasks. Spatiotemporal dependency divergence is calculated for different tasks.
Even though these divergence, the proposed framework exhibits lifelong learning
ability and achieves consistent performance on all tasks.",Peng Bao; Zonghai Chen; Jikai Wang; Deyun Dai; Hao Zhao,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07511v1,False,True,False,False,False,2272.0,Seth Neller,Atlanta,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1109/tits.2023.3300545,"Trajectory, Forgetting, Computer science, Divergence (linguistics), Dependency (UML), Artificial intelligence, Position (finance), Generative model, Generative grammar, Lifelong learning, Machine learning, Psychology, Pedagogy, Philosophy, Linguistics, Physics, Finance, Astronomy, Economics",University of Science and Technology of China,"Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China","Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"
Household Leverage Cycle Around the Great Recession,"This paper provides the first causal evidence that credit supply expansion
caused the 1999-2010 U.S. business cycle mainly through the channel of
household leverage (debt-to-income ratio). Specifically, induced by net export
growth, credit expansion in private-label mortgages, rather than
government-sponsored enterprise mortgages, causes a much stronger boom and bust
cycle in household leverage in the high net-export-growth areas. In addition,
such a stronger household leverage cycle creates a stronger boom and bust cycle
in the local economy, including housing prices, residential construction
investment, and house-related employment. Thus, our results are consistent with
the credit-driven household demand channel (Mian and Sufi, 2018). Further, we
show multiple pieces of evidence against the corporate channel, which is
emphasized by other business cycle theories (hypotheses).",Bo Li,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01539v1,False,True,False,False,False,2280.0,Jonathan Halket,Texas,Active,,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4753328,"Recession, Leverage (statistics), Business cycle, Great recession, Economics, Business, Keynesian economics, Computer science, Machine learning",,,
"Identifying Risk Patterns in Brazilian Police Reports Preceding
  Femicides: A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Based Analysis","Femicide refers to the killing of a female victim, often perpetrated by an
intimate partner or family member, and is also associated with gender-based
violence. Studies have shown that there is a pattern of escalating violence
leading up to these killings, highlighting the potential for prevention if the
level of danger to the victim can be assessed. Machine learning offers a
promising approach to address this challenge by predicting risk levels based on
textual descriptions of the violence. In this study, we employed the Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) technique to identify patterns of behavior in Brazilian
police reports preceding femicides. Our first objective was to classify the
content of these reports as indicating either a lower or higher risk of the
victim being murdered, achieving an accuracy of 66%. In the second approach, we
developed a model to predict the next action a victim might experience within a
sequence of patterned events. Both approaches contribute to the understanding

"Assessment of electrical and infrastructure recovery in Puerto Rico
  following hurricane Maria using a multisource time series of satellite
  imagery","Puerto Rico suffered severe damage from the category 5 hurricane (Maria) in
September 2017. Total monetary damages are estimated to be ~92 billion USD, the
third most costly tropical cyclone in US history. The response to this damage
has been tempered and slow moving, with recent estimates placing 45% of the
population without power three months after the storm. Consequently, we
developed a unique data-fusion mapping approach called the Urban Development
Index (UDI) and new open source tool, Comet Time Series (CometTS), to analyze
the recovery of electricity and infrastructure in Puerto Rico. Our approach
incorporates a combination of time series visualizations and change detection
mapping to create depictions of power or infrastructure loss. It also provides
a unique independent assessment of areas that are still struggling to recover.
For this workflow, our time series approach combines nighttime imagery from the
Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer
Suite (NPP VIIRS), multispectral imagery from two Landsat satellites, US Census
data, and crowd-sourced building footprint labels. Based upon our approach we
can identify and evaluate: 1) the recovery of electrical power compared to
pre-storm levels, 2) the location of potentially damaged infrastructure that
has yet to recover from the storm, and 3) the number of persons without power
over time. As of May 31, 2018, declined levels of observed brightness across
the island indicate that 13.9% +/- ~5.6% of persons still lack power and/or
that 13.2% +/- ~5.3% of infrastructure has been lost. In comparison, the Puerto

"A Bayesian Projection of the Total Fertility Rate of Puerto Rico:
  2020-2050","The abrupt decline in the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) of Puerto Rico since
2000 makes the prospect of a sustained population decline a real possibility.
From 2000 to 2021 the TFR declined from 2.1 to 0.9 children per woman, one of
the lowest in the world. Population projections produced by the United States
Census Bureau and the United Nations Population Division show that the island
population may decline from 3.8 millions in 2000 to slightly above 2 million by
2050, a dramatic 47% population decline in 50 years. As dire as this prospect
may be, this may be an optimistic scenario. Both projections have the TFR
increasing to 1.5 by 2050, but a fertility projection conducted by us show that
fertility can remain much closer to 1.0 until 2050. Bayesian Hierarchical
Probabilistic Theory has been used by the United Nations to incorporate a way
to measure the uncertainty and to estimate the projection parameters. However,
the assumption that the fertility level in countries with low fertility will
eventually increase to 2.1 has been widely criticized as unrealistic and not
supported by evidence. We modified the assumptions used by the United Nations
considering countries with TFR similar to Puerto Rico and find that by 2050
Puerto Rico may have a TFR of 1.1 bounded by a 95% credibility interval
(0.56,1.77). This indicates that there may be a larger population decline than

Behavior of Liquidity Providers in Decentralized Exchanges,"Decentralized exchanges (DEXes) have introduced an innovative trading
mechanism, where it is not necessary to match buy-orders and sell-orders to
execute a trade. DEXes execute each trade individually, and the exchange rate
is automatically determined by the ratio of assets reserved in the market.
Therefore, apart from trading, financial players can also liquidity providers,
benefiting from transaction fees from trades executed in DEXes. Although
liquidity providers are essential for the functionality of DEXes, it is not
clear how liquidity providers behave in such markets. In this paper, we aim to
understand how liquidity providers react to market information and how they
benefit from providing liquidity in DEXes. We measure the operations of
liquidity providers on Uniswap and analyze how they determine their investment
strategy based on market changes. We also reveal their returns and risks of
investments in different trading pair categories, i.e., stable pairs, normal
pairs, and exotic pairs. Further, we investigate the movement of liquidity

"The Transmission of US Monetary Policy Shocks: The Role of Investment &
  Financial Heterogeneity","This paper studies the transmission of US monetary policy shocks into
Emerging Markets emphasizing the role of investment and financial
heterogeneity. First, we use a panel SVAR model to show that a US interest
tightening leads to a persistent recession in Emerging Markets driven by a
sharp reduction in aggregate investment. Second, we study the role of firms'
financial heterogeneity in the transmission of US interest rate shocks by
exploiting detailed balance sheet dataset from Chile. We find that more
indebted firms experience greater drops in investment in response to a US
tightening shock than less indebted firms. This result is at odds with recent
evidence from US firms, even when using the same identification strategy and
econometric methods. Third, we rationalize this finding using a stylized model
of heterogeneous firms subject to a tightening leverage constraint. Finally, we
present evidence in support of this hypothesis as well as robustness checks to
our main results. Overall, our results suggests that the transmission channel

"Time-Series Classification in Smart Manufacturing Systems: An
  Experimental Evaluation of State-of-the-Art Machine Learning Algorithms","Manufacturing is gathering extensive amounts of diverse data, thanks to the
growing number of sensors and rapid advances in sensing technologies. Among the
various data types available in SMS settings, time-series data plays a pivotal
role. Hence, TSC emerges is crucial in this domain. The objective of this study
is to fill this gap by providing a rigorous experimental evaluation of the SoTA
ML and DL algorithms for TSC tasks in manufacturing and industrial settings. We
first explored and compiled a comprehensive list of more than 92 SoTA
algorithms from both TSC and manufacturing literature. Following, we selected
the 36 most representative algorithms from this list. To evaluate their
performance across various manufacturing classification tasks, we curated a set
of 22 manufacturing datasets, representative of different characteristics that
cover diverse manufacturing problems. Subsequently, we implemented and
evaluated the algorithms on the manufacturing benchmark datasets, and analyzed
the results for each dataset. Based on the results, ResNet, DrCIF,
InceptionTime, and ARSENAL are the top-performing algorithms, boasting an
average accuracy of over 96.6% across all 22 manufacturing TSC datasets. These
findings underscore the robustness, efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness
of convolutional kernels in capturing temporal features in time-series data, as
three out of the top four performing algorithms leverage these kernels for
feature extraction. Additionally, LSTM, BiLSTM, and TS-LSTM algorithms deserve
recognition for their effectiveness in capturing features within time-series
data using RNN-based structures.",Mojtaba A. Farahani; M. R.

"The TWA 3 Young Triple System: Orbits, Disks, Evolution","We have characterized the spectroscopic orbit of the TWA 3A binary and
provide preliminary families of probable solutions for the TWA 3A visual orbit
as well as for the wide TWA 3A--B orbit. TWA 3 is a hierarchical triple located
at 34 pc in the $\sim$10 Myr old TW Hya association. The wide component
separation is 1.""55; the close pair was first identified as a possible binary
almost 20 years ago. We initially identified the 35-day period orbital solution
using high-resolution infrared spectroscopy which angularly resolved the A and
B components. We then refined the preliminary orbit by combining the infrared
data with a re-analysis of our high-resolution optical spectroscopy. The
orbital period from the combined spectroscopic solution is $\sim$35 days, the
eccentricity is $\sim$0.63, and the mass ratio is $\sim$0.84; although this
high mass ratio would suggest that optical spectroscopy alone should be
sufficient to identify the orbital solution, the presence of the tertiary B
component likely introduced confusion in the blended optical spectra. Using
millimeter imaging from the literature, we also estimate the inclinations of
the stellar orbital planes with respect to the TWA 3A circumbinary disk
inclination and find that all three planes are likely misaligned by at least
$\sim$30 degrees. The TWA 3A spectroscopic binary components have spectral
types of M4.0 and M4.5; TWA 3B is an M3. We speculate that the system formed as
a triple, is bound, and that its properties were shaped by dynamical
interactions between the inclined orbits and disk.",Kendra Kellogg; L. Prato; Guillermo Torres; G. H. Schaefer; I. Avilez; D. Ruíz-Rodríguez; L. H. Wasserman; Alceste Z. Bonanos; E. W. Guenther; R.

News Sentiment as a Predictor for American Domestic Migration,"This paper goes into depth on the effect that US News Sentiment from national
newspapers has on US interstate migration trends. Through harnessing data from
the New York Times between 2010 and 2020, an average sentiment score was
calculated, allowing for data to be entered into a neural network. Then a
logistic regression model was used to predict interstate migration. The results
indicate the model was highly accurate as the mean margin of error was +/- 900
citizens. The predictions from the model were compared with the US Census data
from 2010 to 2020 that was used to train the model. Since the input for the
model was not exposed to any migration data, the model clearly demonstrated
that its results were drawn from sentiment data alone. These findings are
significant as they indicate that the role of the press could be used as a
predictor for domestic migration which can help the government and businesses
understand better what is influencing people to move to certain places.",Benjamin Lane; Simeon Sayer,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15998v1,False,True,False,False,False,2323.0,Dan Black,Cornell,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1215/08992363-2-2-1,"Economy, Economic geography, Political science, Political economy, Economic system, Sociology, Economics",,"Media, Culture & Communication","Media, Culture & Communication"
"Disentangling individual-level from location-based income uncovers
  socioeconomic preferential mobility and impacts segregation estimates","Segregation encodes information about society, such as social cohesion,
mixing, and inequality. However, most past and current studies tackled
socioeconomic (SE) segregation by analyzing static aggregated mobility
networks, often without considering further individual features beyond income
and, most importantly, without distinguishing individual-level from
location-based income. Accessing individual-level income may help mapping
macroscopic behavior into more granular mobility patterns, hence impacting
segregation estimates. Here we combine a mobile phone dataset of daily mobility
flows across Spanish districts stratified and adjusted by age, gender and
income with census data of districts median income. We build mobility-based SE
assortativity matrices for multiple demographics and observe mobility patterns
of three income groups with respect to location-based SE classes. We find that
SE assortativity differs when isolating the mobility of specific income groups:
we observe that groups prefer to visit areas with higher average income than
their own, which we call preferential mobility. Our analysis suggests
substantial differences between weekdays and weekends SE assortativity by age
class, with weekends characterized by higher SE assortativity. Our modeling
approach shows that the radiation model, which typically performs best at
reproducing inter-municipal population mobility, best fits middle income and
middle-aged flows, while performing worse on young and low income groups. Our
double-sided approach, focusing on assortativity patterns and mobility
modeling, suggests that state of the art mobility models fail at capturing
preferential mobility behavior. Overall, our work indicates that mobility
models considering the interplay of SE preferential behavior, age and gender
gaps may sensibly improve the state of the art models performance.",Marc Duran-Sala; Anandu Koikkalethu Balachandran; Marta Morandini; Timur Naushirvanov; Adarsh Prabhakaran; Andrew Renninger; Mattia Mazzoli,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01799v1,False,True,False,False,False,2334.0,Martin Ruef,Triangle,Completed,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2407.01799,"Socioeconomic status, Demographic economics, Geography, Economics, Econometrics, Demography, Sociology, Population",,,
"Understanding Complex Patterns in Social, Geographic, and Economic
  Inequities in COVID-19 Mortality at the County Level in the US Using
  Generalized Additive Models","I present three types of applications of generalized additive models (GAMs)
to COVID-19 mortality rates in the US for the purpose of advancing methods to
document inequities with respect to which communities suffered disproportionate
COVID-19 mortality rates at specific times during the first three years of the
pandemic. First, GAMs can be used to describe the changing relationship between
COVID-19 mortality and county-level covariates (sociodemographic, economic, and
political metrics) over time. Second, GAMs can be used to perform
spatiotemporal smoothing that pools information over time and space to address
statistical instability due to small population counts or stochasticity
resulting in a smooth, dynamic latent risk surface summarizing the mortality
risk associated with geographic locations over time. Third, estimation of
COVID-19 mortality associations with county-level covariates conditional on a
smooth spatiotemporal risk surface allows for more rigorous consideration of
how socio-environmental contexts and policies may have impacted COVID-19
mortality. Each of these approaches provides a valuable perspective to
documenting inequities in COVID-19 mortality by addressing the question of
which populations have suffered the worst burden of COVID-19 mortality taking
into account the nonlinear spatial, temporal, and social patterning of disease.",Christian Testa,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16629v1,False,True,False,False,False,2338.0,Jason Fletcher,Wisconsin,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2211.16629,"Covariate, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Pandemic, Geography, Generalized additive model, Demography, Smoothing, Population, Socioeconomic status, Econometrics, Statistics, Medicine, Disease, Economics, Sociology, Mathematics, Infectious disease (medical specialty), Pathology",,,
"Reconstructing Native American Migrations from Whole-genome and
  Whole-exome Data","There is great scientific and popular interest in understanding the genetic
history of populations in the Americas. We wish to understand when different
regions of the continent were inhabited, where settlers came from, and how
current inhabitants relate genetically to earlier populations. Recent studies
unraveled parts of the genetic history of the continent using genotyping arrays
and uniparental markers. The 1000 Genomes Project provides a unique opportunity
for improving our understanding of population genetic history by providing over
a hundred sequenced low coverage genomes and exomes from Colombian (CLM),
Mexican-American (MXL), and Puerto Rican (PUR) populations. Here, we explore
the genomic contributions of African, European, and Native American ancestry to
these populations. Estimated Native American ancestry is 48% in MXL, 25% in
CLM, and 13% in PUR. Native American ancestry in PUR is most closely related to
populations surrounding the Orinoco River basin, confirming the Southern
America ancestry of the Ta\'ino people of the Caribbean. We present new methods
to estimate the allele frequencies in the Native American fraction of the
populations, and model their distribution using a demographic model for three
ancestral Native American populations. These ancestral populations likely split
in close succession: the most likely scenario, based on a peopling of the
Americas 16 thousand years ago (kya), supports that the MXL Ancestors split
12.2kya, with a subsequent split of the ancestors to CLM and PUR 11.7kya. The
model also features effective populations of 62,000 in Mexico, 8,700 in
Colombia, and 1,900 in Puerto Rico. Modeling Identity-by-descent and ancestry
tract length, we show that post-contact populations differ markedly in their
effective sizes and migration patterns, with Puerto Rico showing the smallest
effective size and the earlier migration from Europe.",Simon Gravel; Fouad Zakharia; Andres Moreno-Estrada; Jake K Byrnes; Marina Muzzio; Juan L. Rodriguez-Flores; Eimear E. Kenny; Christopher R.

"Using Machine Learning to Evaluate Real Estate Prices Using Location Big
  Data","With everyone trying to enter the real estate market nowadays, knowing the
proper valuations for residential and commercial properties has become crucial.
Past researchers have been known to utilize static real estate data (e.g.
number of beds, baths, square footage) or even a combination of real estate and
demographic information to predict property prices. In this investigation, we
attempted to improve upon past research. So we decided to explore a unique
approach: we wanted to determine if mobile location data could be used to
improve the predictive power of popular regression and tree-based models. To
prepare our data for our models, we processed the mobility data by attaching it
to individual properties from the real estate data that aggregated users within
500 meters of the property for each day of the week. We removed people that
lived within 500 meters of each property, so each property's aggregated
mobility data only contained non-resident census features. On top of these
dynamic census features, we also included static census features, including the
number of people in the area, the average proportion of people commuting, and
the number of residents in the area. Finally, we tested multiple models to
predict real estate prices. Our proposed model is two stacked random forest
modules combined using a ridge regression that uses the random forest outputs
as predictors. The first random forest model used static features only and the
second random forest model used dynamic features only. Comparing our models
with and without the dynamic mobile location features concludes the model with
dynamic mobile location features achieves 3/% percent lower mean squared error
than the same model but without dynamic mobile location features.",Walter Coleman; Ben Johann; Nicholas Pasternak; Jaya Vellayan; Natasha Foutz; Heman Shakeri,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01180v1,False,True,False,False,False,2358.0,Ashvin Gandhi,UCLA,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1109/sieds55548.2022.9799393,"Real estate, Random forest, Property (philosophy), Computer science, Big data, Census, Predictive power, Machine learning, Data mining, Artificial intelligence, Finance, Population, Business, Philosophy, Demography, Epistemology, Sociology",University of Virginia,University of Virginia,University of Virginia
"Exploring differences in injury severity between occupant groups
  involved in fatal rear-end crashes: A correlated random parameter logit model
  with mean heterogeneity","Rear-end crashes are one of the most common crash types. Passenger cars
involved in rear-end crashes frequently produce severe outcomes. However, no
study investigated the differences in the injury severity of occupant groups
when cars are involved as following and leading vehicles in rear-end crashes.
Therefore, the focus of this investigation is to compare the key factors
affecting the injury severity between the front- and rear-car occupant groups
in rear-end crashes. First, data is extracted from the Fatality Analysis
Reporting System (FARS) for two types of rear-end crashes from 2017 to 2019,
including passenger cars as rear-end and rear-ended vehicles. Significant
injury severity difference between front- and rear-car occupant groups is found
by conducting likelihood ratio test. Moreover, the front- and rear-car occupant
groups are modelled by the correlated random parameter logit model with
heterogeneity in means (CRPLHM) and the random parameter logit model with
heterogeneity in means (RPLHM), respectively. From the modeling, the
significant factors are occupant positions, driver age, overturn, vehicle type,
etc. For instance, the driving and front-right positions significantly increase
the probability of severe injury when struck by another vehicle. Large
truck-strike-car tends to cause severe outcomes compared to car-strike-large
truck. This study provides an insightful knowledge of mechanism of occupant
injury severity in rear-end crashes, and propose some effective countermeasures
to mitigate the crash severity, such as implementing stricter seat belt laws,
improving the coverage of the streetlights, strengthening car driver's
emergency response ability.",Renteng Yuan; Xin Gu; Zhipeng Peng; Qiaojun Xiang,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12159v3,False,True,False,False,False,2359.0,David B Richardson,Triangle,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1080/19427867.2023.2292859,"Crash, Logistic regression, Logit, Mixed logit, Random effects model, Statistics, Mathematics, Computer science, Medicine, Meta-analysis, Internal medicine, Programming language",Southeast University; Xi'an Technological University; Beijing University of Technology,"Beijing Key Laboratory of Traffic Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, P.

"Deriving Priors for Bayesian Prediction of Daily Response Propensity in
  Responsive Survey Design: Historical Data Analysis vs. Literature Review","Responsive Survey Design (RSD) aims to increase the efficiency of survey data
collection via live monitoring of paradata and the introduction of protocol
changes when survey errors and increased costs seem imminent. Daily predictions
of response propensity for all active sampled cases are among the most
important quantities for live monitoring of data collection outcomes, making
sound predictions of these propensities essential for the success of RSD.
Because it relies on real-time updates of prior beliefs about key design
quantities, such as predicted response propensities, RSD stands to benefit from
Bayesian approaches. However, empirical evidence of the merits of these
approaches is lacking in the literature, and the derivation of informative
prior distributions is required for these approaches to be effective. In this
paper, we evaluate the ability of two approaches to deriving prior
distributions for the coefficients defining daily response propensity models to
improve predictions of daily response propensity in a real data collection
employing RSD. The first approach involves analyses of historical data from the
same survey, and the second approach involves literature review. We find that
Bayesian methods based on these two approaches result in higher-quality
predictions of response propensity than more standard approaches ignoring prior
information. This is especially true during the early-to-middle periods of data
collection when interventions are often considered in an RSD framework.",Brady T. West; James Wagner; Stephanie Coffey; Michael R.

to better understand human ethical decision-making. In the first survey, folk

second survey, expert responses were based on the expert's application of
different formal ethical frameworks to each scenario. We observed that most of

"Unsupervised Graph Deep Learning Reveals Emergent Flood Risk Profile of
  Urban Areas","Urban flood risk emerges from complex and nonlinear interactions among
multiple features related to flood hazard, flood exposure, and social and
physical vulnerabilities, along with the complex spatial flood dependence
relationships. Existing approaches for characterizing urban flood risk,
however, are primarily based on flood plain maps, focusing on a limited number
of features, primarily hazard and exposure features, without consideration of
feature interactions or the dependence relationships among spatial areas. To
address this gap, this study presents an integrated urban flood-risk rating
model based on a novel unsupervised graph deep learning model (called
FloodRisk-Net). FloodRisk-Net is capable of capturing spatial dependence among
areas and complex and nonlinear interactions among flood hazards and urban
features for specifying emergent flood risk. Using data from multiple
metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the United States, the model
characterizes their flood risk into six distinct city-specific levels. The
model is interpretable and enables feature analysis of areas within each
flood-risk level, allowing for the identification of the three archetypes
shaping the highest flood risk within each MSA. Flood risk is found to be
spatially distributed in a hierarchical structure within each MSA, where the
core city disproportionately bears the highest flood risk. Multiple cities are
found to have high overall flood-risk levels and low spatial inequality,
indicating limited options for balancing urban development and flood-risk
reduction. Relevant flood-risk reduction strategies are discussed considering
ways that the highest flood risk and uneven spatial distribution of flood risk
are formed.",Kai Yin; Ali Mostafavi,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14610v3,False,True,False,False,False,2377.0,Lala Ma,Kentucky,Active,,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4631611,"Flood myth, Unsupervised learning, Deep learning, Geography, Artificial intelligence, Computer science, Archaeology",Texas A&M University; Mitchell Institute,Texas A&M University,Texas A&M University

"Self-respecting worker in the precarious gig economy: A dynamic
  principal-agent model","We introduce a dynamic principal-agent model to understand the nature of
contracts between an employer and an independent gig worker. We model the
worker's self-respect with an endogenous backward-looking participation
constraint; he accepts a job offer if and only if its utility is at least as
large as his reference value, which is based on the average of previously
realized wages. If the dynamically changing reference value capturing the
worker's demand is too high, then no contract is struck until the reference
value hits a threshold. Below the threshold, contracts are offered and
accepted, and the worker's wage demand follows a stochastic process. We apply
our model to perfectly competitive and monopsonistic labor market structures
and investigate first-best and second-best solutions. We show that a
far-sighted employer with market power may sacrifice instantaneous profit to
regulate the agent's demand. Moreover, the far-sighted employer implements
increasing and path-dependent effort levels. Our model captures the worker's
bargaining power by a vulnerability parameter that measures the rate at which
his wage demand decreases when unemployed. With a low vulnerability parameter,
the worker can afford to go unemployed and need not take a job at all costs.
Conversely, a worker with high vulnerability can be exploited by the employer,
and in this case our model also exhibits self-exploitation.",Zsolt Bihary; Péter Csóka; Péter Kerényi; Alexander Szimayer,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10021v4,False,True,False,False,False,2387.0,Gal Wettstein,Boston,Active,,https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/nmyxp,"Corporate governance, Social media, Scrutiny, Digital economy, Foreign ownership, Stakeholder, Accountability, Globe, Business, Political economy, Business model, Sharing economy, Market economy, Public relations, Economics, Political science, Marketing, Foreign direct investment, Medicine, Finance, Ophthalmology, Law, Macroeconomics",,,
"Bounding the Photon Mass with Ultrawide Bandwidth Pulsar Timing Data and
  Dedispersed Pulses of Fast Radio Bursts","Exploring the concept of a massive photon has been an important area in
astronomy and physics. If photons have mass, their propagation in nonvacuum

of a plasma medium. This would lead to a delay time proportional to
$m_{\gamma}^2\nu^{-4}$, which deviates from the classical dispersion relation
(proportional to $\nu^{-2}$). For the first time, we have derived the
dispersion relation of a photon with a nonzero mass propagating in plasma. To
reduce the impact of variations in the dispersion measure (DM), we employed the
high-precision timing data to constrain the upper bound of the photon mass.
Specifically, the DM/time of arrival (TOA) uncertainties derived from ultrawide
bandwidth (UWB) observations conducted by the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA)
are used. The dedispersed pulses from fast radio bursts (FRBs) with minimal
scattering effects are also used to constrain the upper bound of photon mass.
The stringent limit on the photon mass is determined by uncertainties of the
TOA of pulsars, with an optimum value of $9.52\times 10^{-46} \, \rm kg
\,\,(5.34 \times 10^{-10}\, \rm eV/c^2$). In the future, it is essential to
investigate the photon mass, as pulsar timing data are collected by PTA and UWB

"Implications of the first evidence for coherent elastic scattering of
  reactor neutrinos","The recent evidence for coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering
(CE$\nu$NS) in the NCC-1701 germanium detector using antineutrinos from the
Dresden-II nuclear reactor is in good agreement with standard model
expectations. However, we show that a $2\sigma$ improvement in the fit to the

Lindhard model. We also place constraints on the parameter space of a light
vector or scalar mediator that couples to neutrinos and quarks, and on a
neutrino magnetic moment. We demonstrate that the constraints are quite
sensitive to the quenching factor at low recoil energies by comparing
constraints for the standard Lindhard model with those by marginalizing over
the two parameters of the modified Lindhard model.",Jiajun Liao; Hongkai Liu; Danny Marfatia,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10622v2,False,True,False,False,False,2391.0,Danny Kurban,Colorado,Completed,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevd.106.l031702,"Physics, Neutrino, Particle physics, Recoil, Nuclear physics, Elastic scattering, Parameter space, Standard Model (mathematical formulation), Scalar (mathematics), Sigma, Scattering, Quantum mechanics, Statistics, Geometry, Mathematics, Archaeology, Gauge (firearms), History",Technion – Israel Institute of Technology; Sun Yat-sen University; University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa,"Department of Physics, Technion—Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 3200003, Israel; Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822, USA; School of Physics, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China","Department of Physics, Technion—Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 3200003, Israel; Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822, USA; School of Physics, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China"
Adapting End-to-End Speech Recognition for Readable Subtitles,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are primarily evaluated on
transcription accuracy. However, in some use cases such as subtitling, verbatim
transcription would reduce output readability given limited screen size and
reading time. Therefore, this work focuses on ASR with output compression, a
task challenging for supervised approaches due to the scarcity of training
data. We first investigate a cascaded system, where an unsupervised compression
model is used to post-edit the transcribed speech. We then compare several
methods of end-to-end speech recognition under output length constraints. The
experiments show that with limited data far less than needed for training a
model from scratch, we can adapt a Transformer-based ASR model to incorporate
both transcription and compression capabilities. Furthermore, the best
performance in terms of WER and ROUGE scores is achieved by explicitly modeling
the length constraints within the end-to-end ASR system.",Danni Liu; Jan Niehues; Gerasimos Spanakis,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12143v1,False,True,False,False,False,2391.0,Danny Kurban,Colorado,Completed,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.iwslt-1.30,"Computer science, Speech recognition, Transcription (linguistics), Transformer, End-to-end principle, Language model, Readability, Artificial intelligence, Task (project management), Natural language processing, Philosophy, Linguistics, Physics, Management, Quantum mechanics, Voltage, Economics, Programming language",Maastricht University,"Department of Data Science and Knowledge Engineering, Maastricht University","Department of Data Science and Knowledge Engineering, Maastricht University"
"Uncovering Urban Mobility and City Dynamics from Large-Scale Taxi
  Origin-Destination (O-D) Trips: Case Study in Washington DC Area","We perform a systematic analysis on the large-scale taxi trip data to uncover
urban mobility and city dynamics in multimodal urban transportation
environments. As a case study, we use the taxi origin-destination trip data and
some additional data sources in Washington DC area. We first study basic
characteristics of taxi trips, then focus on five important aspects. Three of
them concern urban mobility, which are respectively mobility and cost including
effect of traffic congestion, trip safety, and multimodal connectivity; the
other two pertain to city dynamics, which are respectively transportation
resilience and the relation between trip patterns and land use. For these
aspects, we use appropriate statistical methods and geographic techniques to
mine patterns and characteristics from taxi trip data for better understanding
qualitative and quantitative impacts of the inputs from key stakeholders on
available measures of effectiveness on urban mobility and city dynamics, where
key stakeholders include road users, system operators, and city. Finally, we
briefly summarize our findings and discuss some critical roles and implications
of the uncovered patterns and characteristics from the relation between taxi
system and key stakeholders. The results can support road users by providing
evidence-based information of trip cost, mobility, safety, multimodal
connectivity and transportation resilience, can assist taxi drivers and
operators to deliver transportation services in a higher quality of mobility,
safety and operational efficiency, and can also help city planners and policy
makers to transform multimodal transportation and to manage urban resources in
a more effective and better way.",Xiao-Feng Xie; Zunjing Jenipher Wang,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09583v1,False,True,False,False,False,2403.0,Evan Mast,Philadelphia,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1812.09583,"TRIPS architecture, Multimodal transport, Transport engineering, Resilience (materials science), Key (lock), Scale (ratio), Psychological resilience, Relation (database), Computer science, Traffic congestion, Business, Geography, Computer security, Engineering, Cartography, Psychology, Physics, Database, Psychotherapist, Thermodynamics",,,
Crowdsourcing the Robin Hood effect in cities,"Socioeconomic inequalities in cities are embedded in space and result in
neighborhood effects, whose harmful consequences have proved very hard to
counterbalance efficiently by planning policies alone. Considering
redistribution of money flows as a first step toward improved spatial equity,
we study a bottom-up approach that would rely on a slight evolution of shopping
mobility practices. Building on a database of anonymized credit card
transactions in Madrid and Barcelona, we quantify the mobility effort required
to reach a reference situation where commercial income is evenly shared among
neighborhoods. The redirections of shopping trips preserve key properties of
human mobility, including travel distances. Surprisingly, for both cities only
a small fraction ($\sim 5 \%$) of trips need to be altered to reach equity
situations, improving even other sustainability indicators. The method could be
implemented in mobile applications that would assist individuals in reshaping
their shopping practices, to promote the spatial redistribution of
opportunities in the city.",Thomas Louail; Maxime Lenormand; Juan Murillo Arias; José J.

reveal that in addition to factors such as race, education, and income,
geographical attributes such as access to amenities in a neighborhood that
satisfy community needs were equally important factors for predicting
neighborhood adaptability and the spread of COVID-19. The results of our study

"A Network Perspective on Attitude Strength: Testing the Connectivity
  Hypothesis","Attitude strength is a key characteristic of attitudes. Strong attitudes are
durable and impactful, while weak attitudes are fluctuating and
inconsequential. Recently, the Causal Attitude Network (CAN) model was proposed
as a comprehensive measurement model of attitudes, which conceptualizes
attitudes as networks of causally connected evaluative reactions (i.e.,
beliefs, feelings, and behavior toward an attitude object). Here, we test the
central postulate of the CAN model that highly connected attitude networks
correspond to strong attitudes. We use data from the American National Election
Studies 1980-2012 on attitudes toward presidential candidates (total n =

"Social network analysis of electric vehicles adoption: a data-based
  approach","Mobility is undergoing dramatic transformations. Especially in the context of
urban areas, several significant changes are underway, driven by both new
mobility needs and environmental concerns. The most mature one, which still is
struggling to affirm itself is the process of the adoption of Electric Vehicles
(EVs), thus switching from fuel-based to battery-powered propulsion
technologies. Many social and economic barriers have proved to play a crucial
role in this process, ranging from level of education, environmental awareness,
age and census. This work aims at contributing to the study of this adoption
process through a data-based lens, using real mobility patterns to setup a
social-network analysis to model the spread of consensus among neighbouring
people that can enable the switch to EVs. In particular, we build the network
topology using proximity measures that emerge from the analysis of real trips,
and the initial disposition of the single agents towards the EV technology is
inferred from their real mobility patterns. Based on this network, a cascade
adoption model is simulated to investigate the dynamics of the adoption

Recent topics on the O'Hara energies,"The O'Hara energies, introduced by Jun O'Hara in 1991, were proposed to
answer the question of what is a ""good"" figure in a given knot type. A property
of the O'Hara energies is that the ""better"" the figure of a knot is, the less
the energy value is. In this article, we discuss two topics on the O'Hara
energies. First, we slightly generalize the O'Hara energies and consider a
characterization of its finiteness. The finiteness of the O'Hara energies was
considered by Blatt in 2012 who used the Sobolev-Slobodeckii space, and
naturally we consider a generalization of this space. Another fundamental
problem is to understand the minimizers of the O'Hara energies. This problem
has been addressed in several papers, some of them based on numerical
computations. In this direction, we discuss a discretization of the O'Hara
energies and give some examples of numerical computations. Particular one of
the O'Hara energies, called the M\""{o}bius energy thanks to its M\""{o}bius

Low-Resource Court Judgment Summarization for Common Law Systems,"Common law courts need to refer to similar precedents' judgments to inform
their current decisions. Generating high-quality summaries of court judgment
documents can facilitate legal practitioners to efficiently review previous
cases and assist the general public in accessing how the courts operate and how
the law is applied. Previous court judgment summarization research focuses on
civil law or a particular jurisdiction's judgments. However, judges can refer
to the judgments from all common law jurisdictions. Current summarization
datasets are insufficient to satisfy the demands of summarizing precedents
across multiple jurisdictions, especially when labeled data are scarce for many
jurisdictions. To address the lack of datasets, we present CLSum, the first
dataset for summarizing multi-jurisdictional common law court judgment
documents. Besides, this is the first court judgment summarization work
adopting large language models (LLMs) in data augmentation, summary generation,
and evaluation. Specifically, we design an LLM-based data augmentation method

evaluation metric based on LLM to assess the quality of generated judgment
summaries. Our experimental results verify that the LLM-based summarization

Endogenous Crashes as Phase Transitions,"This paper explores the mechanisms behind extreme financial events,
specifically market crashes, by employing the theoretical framework of phase
transitions. We focus on endogenous crashes, driven by internal market
dynamics, and model these events as first-order phase transitions critical,
stochastic, and dynamic. Through a comparative analysis of early warning
signals associated with each type of transition, we demonstrate that dynamic
phase transitions (DPT) offer a more accurate representation of market crashes
than critical (CPT) or stochastic phase transitions (SPT). Unlike existing
models, such as the Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) model, which often suffers
from overfitting and false positives, our approach grounded in DPT provides a
more robust prediction framework. Empirical findings, based on an analysis of
S&P 500 stocks from 2019 to 2024, reveal significant trends in volatility and
anomalous dimensions before crashes, supporting the superiority of the DPT
model. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the predictive
signals preceding market crashes and offers a novel perspective on their

molecular beam epitaxy under distillation conditions, which allows a very
precise control of the doping concentration and oxygen stoichiometry. Using
soft x-ray magnetic circular dichroism at the Eu and Gd M4,5 edges, we found
that the Curie temperature ranged from 69 K for pure stoichiometric EuO to
about 170 K for the film with the optimal Gd doping of around 4%. We also show
that the Gd magnetic moment couples ferromagnetically to that of Eu.",H. Ott; S. J. Heise; R. Sutarto; Z. Hu; C. F. Chang; H. H. Hsieh; H. -J. Lin; C. T. Chen; L. H.

"Epitaxy, stoichiometry, and magnetic properties of Gd-doped EuO films on

films. Using Eu-distillation-assisted molecular beam epitaxy and a systematic
variation in the Gd and oxygen deposition rates, we have been able to observe
sustained layer-by-layer epitaxial growth on yttria-stabilized cubic zirconia

used soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Eu and Gd M4,5 edges to confirm
the absence of Eu3+ contaminants and to determine the actual Gd concentration.

"Evaluating the Environmental Justice Dimensions of Odor in Denver,
  Colorado","Background Odors are a documented environmental justice challenge in Denver,
Colorado. Complaints are an important modality through which residents express
their concerns. Objective We investigated disparities in environmental justice
related-variables based on home and workplace census block groups
(race/ethnicity, education-levels, renter-occupied housing, median income and
median home values, gentrification) based on locations of odor complaints as
well as that of potentially malodorous facilities. We report key themes
identified in complaints. Methods We obtained odor complaints for 2014-2023,
and the locations of facilities required to submit odor management plans as of
2023 from the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment. We downloaded
residential census block group-level socioeconomic data from the 2016-2020
American Community Survey; and workplace-based socioeconomic data from the
Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics dataset for 2020. We categorized
neighborhoods as gentrified or not based on a typology produced by the Urban
Displacement Project. We assessed exposure to potentially malodorous facilities
and complaints within each census block group and investigated exposure
disparities by comparing distributions of environmental justice-related
variables based on if a facility or a complaint has been made, and census block
group-level odor intensity categories. Results Less privileged census block
groups were significantly disproportionately burdened with potentially
malodorous facilities. Importantly, our study also reveals disparities in the
location of facilities, not just in traditional residence/-based environmental
justice-related variables, but in workplace/-based factors, as well. We did not
observe similar disparities for odor complaints. However, complaints were
significantly higher in gentrified neighborhoods.",Priyanka N. deSouza; Amanda Rees; Emilia Oscilowicz; Brendan Lawlor; William Obermann; Katherine Dickinson; Lisa M.

Notification Timing for On-Demand Personnel Scheduling,"Modern business models have enabled service systems to leverage a large pool
of casual employees with flexible hours, paid based on piece rates, to fulfill
on-demand work. These systems have been successfully implemented in sectors
such as ride-sharing, delivery services, and microtasks. However, because
casual employees engage infrequently and may lack experience, maintaining
service quality remains a key challenge. We introduce a novel scheduling system
designed to provide experienced casual employees to service companies,
optimizing their operations through a dynamic, data-driven approach. Similar to
traditional on-call systems, it contacts casual personnel in order of seniority
to inform them about available work. However, our system offers greater
flexibility, allowing employees to take time to decide and freely select from
available shifts. Senior employees can also replace (bump) junior employees
from the schedule if no other preferred shift is available, subject to certain
conditions. While permitted, these replacements create disruptions and
dissatisfaction among employees. The management aims to efficiently assign all
shifts while minimizing bumps. However, uncertainty arises regarding when an
employee will select a shift. The key challenge is determining the optimal
timing to notify employees to reduce disruptions. We first establish that this
problem is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete even with perfect information. To address
this, we propose a two-stage stochastic formulation for the dynamic problem and
develop a heuristic algorithm that approximates the optimal policy using a
threshold-based structure. These policies are fine-tuned using offline
solutions with pre-known uncertainty, allowing for optimization. Testing on
real-world data demonstrates that our approach outperforms the current strategy
used by our industry partner.",Prakash Gawas; Antoine Legrain; Louis-Martin Rousseau,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06139v2,False,True,False,False,False,2459.0,Stephanie Karol,Michigan,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224298304700303,"Marketing, Service (business), Business, Services marketing, Diversity (politics), Focus (optics), Affect (linguistics), Task (project management), Tertiary sector of the economy, Marketing research, Knowledge management, Sociology, Computer science, Management, Economics, Physics, Communication, Anthropology, Optics",,Associate Professor at Harvard Business School.,Associate Professor at Harvard Business School.

two-qubit entangled states with desired form of reduced density matrices of the
same purity and, in particular, arbitrary identical reduced states of qubits.

"Rapid adjustment and post-processing of temperature forecast
  trajectories","Modern weather forecasts are commonly issued as consistent multi-day forecast
trajectories with a time resolution of 1-3 hours. Prior to issuing, statistical
post-processing is routinely used to correct systematic errors and
misrepresentations of the forecast uncertainty. However, once the forecast has
been issued, it is rarely updated before it is replaced in the next forecast
cycle of the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. This paper shows that
the error correlation structure within the forecast trajectory can be utilized
to substantially improve the forecast between the NWP forecast cycles by
applying additional post-processing steps each time new observations become
available. The proposed rapid adjustment is applied to temperature forecast
trajectories from the UK Met Office's convective-scale ensemble MOGREPS-UK.
MOGREPS-UK is run four times daily and produces hourly forecasts for up to 36
hours ahead. Our results indicate that the rapidly adjusted forecast from the
previous NWP forecast cycle outperforms the new forecast for the first few
hours of the next cycle, or until the new forecast itself can be rapidly
adjusted, suggesting a new strategy for updating the forecast cycle.",Nina Schuhen; Thordis Thorarinsdottir; Alex Lenkoski,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05101v1,False,True,False,False,False,2479.0,Xin Dai,Philadelphia,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.3718,"Numerical weather prediction, Forecast error, Forecast verification, Forecast skill, Meteorology, Global Forecast System, Consensus forecast, Trajectory, Environmental science, Quantitative precipitation forecast, Computer science, Climatology, Econometrics, Mathematics, Geography, Geology, Precipitation, Physics, Astronomy",Norwegian Computing Center,"Norwegian Computing Center, Oslo, Norway","Norwegian Computing Center, Oslo, Norway"
Planning of integrated mobility-on-demand and urban transit networks,"We envision a multimodal transportation system where Mobility-on-Demand (MoD)
service is used to serve the first mile and last mile of transit trips. For
this purpose, the current research formulates an optimization model for
designing an integrated MoD and urban transit system. The proposed model is a
mixed-integer non-linear programming model that captures the strategic behavior
of passengers in a multimodal network through a passenger assignment model. It
determines which transit routes to operate, the frequency of the operating
routes, the fleet size of vehicles required in each transportation analysis
zone to serve the demand, and the passenger flow on both road and transit
networks. A Benders decomposition approach with several enhancements is
proposed to solve the given optimization program. Computational experiments are
presented for the Sioux Falls multimodal network. The results show a
significant improvement in the congestion in the city center with the
introduction and optimization of an integrated transportation system. The
proposed design allocates more vehicles to the outskirt zones in the network
(to serve the first mile and last mile of transit trips) and more frequency to
the transit routes in the city center. The integrated system significantly
improves the share of transit passengers and their level of service in
comparison to the base optimized transit system. The sensitivity analysis of
the bus and vehicle fleet shows that increasing the number of buses has more
impact on improving the level of service of passengers compared to increasing
the number of MoD vehicles. Finally, we provide managerial insights for
deploying such multimodal service.",Pramesh Kumar; Alireza Khani,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11005v2,False,True,False,False,False,2481.0,Miles Finney,UCLA,Completed,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2022.11.001,"Transit (satellite), TRIPS architecture, Transport engineering, Last mile (transportation), Service (business), Public transport, Urban rail transit, Multimodal transport, Mile, Urban transit, Computer science, Integer programming, Decomposition, Level of service, Flow network, Traffic congestion, Network planning and design, System optimization, Engineering, Computer network, Business, Ecology, Mathematical optimization, Physics, Mathematics, Algorithm, Marketing, Astronomy, Biology",University of Minnesota,"Department of Civil, Environmental and Geo-Engineering, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, MN, United States of America","Department of Civil, Environmental and Geo-Engineering, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, MN, United States of America"
"Stock fluctuations are correlated and amplified across networks of
  interlocking directorates","Traded corporations are required by law to have a majority of outside
directors on their board. This requirement allows the existence of directors
who sit on the board of two or more corporations at the same time, generating
what is commonly known as interlocking directorates. While research has shown
that networks of interlocking directorates facilitate the transmission of
information between corporations, little is known about the extent to which
such interlocking networks can explain the fluctuations of stock price returns.
Yet, this is a special concern since the risk of amplifying stock fluctuations
is latent. To answer this question, here we analyze the board composition,
traders' perception, and stock performance of more than 1500 US traded
corporations from 2007-2011. First, we find that the fewer degrees of
separation between two corporations in the interlocking network, the stronger
the temporal correlation between their stock price returns. Second, we find
that the centrality of traded corporations in the interlocking network
correlates with the frequency at which financial traders talk about such
corporations, and this frequency is in turn proportional to the corresponding
traded volume. Third, we show that the centrality of corporations was
negatively associated with their stock performance in 2008, the year of the big
financial crash. These results suggest that the strategic decisions made by
interlocking directorates are strongly followed by stock analysts and have the
potential to correlate and amplify the movement of stock prices during
financial crashes. These results may have relevant implications for scholars,
investors, and regulators.",Serguei Saavedra; Luis J. Gilarranz; Rudolf P.

Online Continual Learning on Hierarchical Label Expansion,"Continual learning (CL) enables models to adapt to new tasks and environments
without forgetting previously learned knowledge. While current CL setups have
ignored the relationship between labels in the past task and the new task with
or without small task overlaps, real-world scenarios often involve hierarchical
relationships between old and new tasks, posing another challenge for
traditional CL approaches. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
multi-level hierarchical class incremental task configuration with an online
learning constraint, called hierarchical label expansion (HLE). Our
configuration allows a network to first learn coarse-grained classes, with data
labels continually expanding to more fine-grained classes in various hierarchy
depths. To tackle this new setup, we propose a rehearsal-based method that
utilizes hierarchy-aware pseudo-labeling to incorporate hierarchical class
information. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective memory management
and sampling strategy that selectively adopts samples of newly encountered
classes. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively
use hierarchy on our HLE setup to improve classification accuracy across all
levels of hierarchies, regardless of depth and class imbalance ratio,

outperforming them on the conventional disjoint, blurry and i-Blurry CL setups.",Byung Hyun Lee; Okchul Jung; Jonghyun Choi; Se Young Chun,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14374v1,False,True,False,False,False,2485.0,Ryun Jung Lee,Texas,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1109/iccv51070.2023.01080,"Computer science, Forgetting, Hierarchy, Disjoint sets, Task (project management), Class (philosophy), Artificial intelligence, Class hierarchy, Machine learning, Constraint (computer-aided design), Simple (philosophy), Mechanical engineering, Object-oriented programming, Philosophy, Linguistics, Mathematics, Management, Epistemology, Combinatorics, Economics, Engineering, Market economy, Programming language",Seoul National University; Yonsei University,"Dept. of ECE, Seoul National University, Republic of Korea; INMC & IPAI, Seoul National University, Republic of Korea; Yonsei University, Republic of Korea","Dept. of ECE, Seoul National University, Republic of Korea; INMC & IPAI, Seoul National University, Republic of Korea; Yonsei University, Republic of Korea"
Beyond Baby Blues: The Child Penalty in Mental Health in Switzerland,"This paper investigates the mental health penalty for women after childbirth
in Switzerland. Leveraging insurance data, we employ a staggered

mental health penalty for women following the birth of their first child.
Approximately four years after childbirth, there is a one percentage point
(p.p.) increase in antidepressant prescriptions, representing a 50% increase
compared to pre-birth levels. This increase rises to 1.7 p.p. (a 70% increase)
six years postpartum. The mental health penalty is likely not only a direct
consequence of giving birth but also a consequence of the changed life
circumstances and time constraints that accompany it, as the penalty is rising
over time and is higher for women who are employed before childbirth.",Nora Bearth,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20861v1,False,True,False,False,False,2488.0,Pilar Gonalons,Philadelphia,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2410.20861,"Blues, Mental health, Psychology, Psychiatry, History, Art history",,,
"Procurement in welfare programs: Evidence and implications from WIC
  infant formula contracts","This paper examines the impact of government procurement in social welfare
programs on consumers, manufacturers, and the government. We analyze the U.S.
infant formula market, where over half of the total sales are purchased by the
Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program. The WIC program utilizes
first-price auctions to solicit rebates from the three main formula
manufacturers, with the winner exclusively serving all WIC consumers in the
winning state. The manufacturers compete aggressively in providing rebates
which account for around 85% of the wholesale price. To rationalize and
disentangle the factors contributing to this phenomenon, we model
manufacturers' retail pricing competition by incorporating two unique features:
price inelastic WIC consumers and government regulation on WIC brand prices.
Our findings confirm three sizable benefits from winning the auction: a notable
spill-over effect on non-WIC demand, a significant marginal cost reduction, and
a higher retail price for the WIC brand due to the price inelasticity of WIC
consumers. Our counterfactual analysis shows that procurement auctions affect
manufacturers asymmetrically, with the smallest manufacturer harmed the most.
More importantly, by switching from the current mechanism to a predetermined
rebate procurement, the government can still contain the cost successfully,
consumers' surplus is greatly improved, and the smallest manufacturer benefits
from the switch, promoting market competition.",Yonghong An; David Davis; Yizao Liu; Ruli Xiao,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12479v1,False,True,False,False,False,2494.0,Anna Malinovskaya,Cornell,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2308.12479,"Procurement, Common value auction, Competition (biology), Government procurement, Government (linguistics), Counterfactual thinking, Business, Welfare, Economic surplus, Economics, Microeconomics, Industrial organization, Marketing, Market economy, Ecology, Philosophy, Linguistics, Epistemology, Biology",,,
"PitVQA++: Vector Matrix-Low-Rank Adaptation for Open-Ended Visual
  Question Answering in Pituitary Surgery","Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in visual question answering (VQA) offer a
unique opportunity to enhance intra-operative decision-making, promote
intuitive interactions, and significantly advancing surgical education.
However, the development of VLMs for surgical VQA is challenging due to limited
datasets and the risk of overfitting and catastrophic forgetting during full
fine-tuning of pretrained weights. While parameter-efficient techniques like
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Matrix of Rank Adaptation (MoRA) address
adaptation challenges, their uniform parameter distribution overlooks the
feature hierarchy in deep networks, where earlier layers, that learn general
features, require more parameters than later ones. This work introduces
PitVQA++ with an open-ended PitVQA dataset and vector matrix-low-rank
adaptation (Vector-MoLoRA), an innovative VLM fine-tuning approach for adapting
GPT-2 to pituitary surgery. Open-Ended PitVQA comprises around 101,803 frames
from 25 procedural videos with 745,972 question-answer sentence pairs, covering
key surgical elements such as phase and step recognition, context
understanding, tool detection, localization, and interactions recognition.
Vector-MoLoRA incorporates the principles of LoRA and MoRA to develop a
matrix-low-rank adaptation strategy that employs vector ranking to allocate
more parameters to earlier layers, gradually reducing them in the later layers.
Our approach, validated on the Open-Ended PitVQA and EndoVis18-VQA datasets,
effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while significantly enhancing
performance over recent baselines. Furthermore, our risk-coverage analysis
highlights its enhanced reliability and trustworthiness in handling uncertain
predictions. Our source code and dataset is available

Statistical Arbitrage Risk Premium by Machine Learning,"How to hedge factor risks without knowing the identities of the factors? We
first prove a general theoretical result: even if the exact set of factors
cannot be identified, any risky asset can use some portfolio of similar peer
assets to hedge against its own factor exposures. A long position of a risky
asset and a short position of a ""replicate portfolio"" of its peers represent
that asset's factor residual risk. We coin the expected return of an asset's
factor residual risk as its Statistical Arbitrage Risk Premium (SARP). The
challenge in empirically estimating SARP is finding the peers for each asset
and constructing the replicate portfolios. We use the elastic-net, a machine
learning method, to project each stock's past returns onto that of every other
stock. The resulting high-dimensional but sparse projection vector serves as
investment weights in constructing the stocks' replicate portfolios. We say a
stock has high (low) Statistical Arbitrage Risk (SAR) if it has low (high)
R-squared with its peers. The key finding is that ""unique"" stocks have both a
higher SARP and higher excess returns than ""ubiquitous"" stocks: in the
cross-section, high SAR stocks have a monthly SARP (monthly excess returns)
that is 1.101% (0.710%) greater than low SAR stocks. The average SAR across all
stocks is countercyclical. Our results are robust to controlling for various
known priced factors and characteristics.",Raymond C. W.

"Reference-dependent asset pricing with a stochastic consumption-dividend
  ratio","We study a discrete-time consumption-based capital asset pricing model under
expectations-based reference-dependent preferences. More precisely, we consider
an endowment economy populated by a representative agent who derives utility
from current consumption and from gains and losses in consumption with respect
to a forward-looking, stochastic reference point. First, we consider a general
model in which the agent's preferences include both contemporaneous gain-loss
utility, that is, utility from the difference between current consumption and
previously held expectations about current consumption, and prospective
gain-loss utility, that is, utility from the difference between intertemporal
beliefs about future consumption. A semi-closed form solution for equilibrium
asset prices is derived for this case. We then specialize to a model in which
the agent derives contemporaneous gain-loss utility only, obtaining equilibrium
asset prices in closed form. Extensive numerical experiments show that, with
plausible values of risk aversion and loss aversion, our models can generate
equity premia that match empirical estimates. Interestingly, the models turn
out to be consistent with some well-known empirical facts, namely procyclical
variation in the price-dividend ratio and countercyclical variation in the
conditional expected equity premium and in the conditional volatility of the
equity premium. Furthermore, we find that prospective gain-loss utility is
necessary for the model to predict reasonable values of the price-dividend
ratio.",Luca De Gennaro Aquino; Xuedong He; Moris Simon Strub; Yuting Yang,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12856v1,False,True,False,False,False,2508.0,Lois Miller,Wisconsin,Active,,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4696530,"Capital asset pricing model, Dividend, Financial economics, Asset (computer security), Economics, Econometrics, Business, Consumption-based capital asset pricing model, Monetary economics, Finance, Computer science, Computer security",Chinese University of Hong Kong; University of Warwick; University of Copenhagen,The Chinese University of Hong Kong - Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management; University of Warwick - Warwick Business School; University of Copenhagen,The Chinese University of Hong Kong - Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management; University of Warwick - Warwick Business School; University of Copenhagen
Wealth and Poverty: The Effect of Poverty on Communities,"This paper analyzes the differences in poverty in high wealth communities and

Income and Living Conditions 2019. The simulation takes into account the
development of income, as per the observed developments in the first three
quarters of 2020, derived from the Labor Force Survey, which incorporates the
raw effect of the pandemic and the government response. In North Macedonia,
almost no government measure directly aimed the income of children, however,
three key and largest measures addressed household income: the wage subsidy of
14.500 MKD per worker in the hardest hit companies, relaxation of the criteria
for obtaining the guaranteed minimum income, and one-off support to vulnerable
groups of the population in two occasions. Results suggest that the relative
child poverty rate is estimated to increase from 27.8 percent before the
pandemic to 32.4 percent during the pandemic. This increase puts additional
19,000 children below the relative poverty threshold. Results further suggest
that absolute poverty is likely to reduce primarily because of the automatic
stabilizers in the case of social assistance and because of the one-time cash
assistance.",Marjan Petreski,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05110v1,False,True,False,False,False,2510.0,Charles Varner,Stanford,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2310.05110,"Poverty, Microsimulation, Subsidy, Pandemic, Population, Economics, Income Support, Demographic economics, Government (linguistics), Household income, Wage, Social security, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Socioeconomics, Economic growth, Geography, Labour economics, Environmental health, Medicine, Market economy, Linguistics, Philosophy, Disease, Archaeology, Pathology, Transport engineering, Infectious disease (medical specialty), Engineering, Macroeconomics",,,

"Twitter and Census Data Analytics to Explore Socioeconomic Factors for
  Post-COVID-19 Reopening Sentiment","Investigating and classifying sentiments of social media users towards an
item, situation, and system are very popular among the researchers. However,
they rarely discuss the underlying socioeconomic factor associations for such
sentiments. This study attempts to explore the factors associated with positive
and negative sentiments of the people about reopening the economy, in the
United States (US) amidst the COVID-19 global crisis. It takes into
consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel
pattern due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and
emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people
about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 51
states including Washington DC of the US. State-wide socioeconomic
characteristics of the people, built environment data, and the number of
COVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to
perform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors
that influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from
the logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education
levels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher
house rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast,
households with a high number of members and high income are less interested to
reopen the economy. The model can correctly classify 56.18% of the sentiments.
The Pearson chi2 test indicates that overall this model has high
goodness-of-fit. This study provides a clear indication to the policymakers
where to allocate resources and what policy options they can undertake to
improve the socioeconomic situations of the people and mitigate the impacts of
pandemics in the current situation and as well as in the future.",Md. Mokhlesur Rahman; G. G. Md. Nawaz Ali; Xue Jun Li; Kamal Chandra Paul; Peter H. J.

"Simultaneous Corn and Soybean Yield Prediction from Remote Sensing Data
  Using Deep Transfer Learning","Large-scale crop yield estimation is, in part, made possible due to the
availability of remote sensing data allowing for the continuous monitoring of
crops throughout their growth cycle. Having this information allows
stakeholders the ability to make real-time decisions to maximize yield
potential. Although various models exist that predict yield from remote sensing
data, there currently does not exist an approach that can estimate yield for
multiple crops simultaneously, and thus leads to more accurate predictions. A
model that predicts the yield of multiple crops and concurrently considers the
interaction between multiple crop yields. We propose a new convolutional neural
network model called YieldNet which utilizes a novel deep learning framework
that uses transfer learning between corn and soybean yield predictions by
sharing the weights of the backbone feature extractor. Additionally, to
consider the multi-target response variable, we propose a new loss function. We
conduct our experiment using data from 1,132 counties for corn and 1,076
counties for soybean across the United States. Numerical results demonstrate
that our proposed method accurately predicts corn and soybean yield from one to
four months before the harvest with a MAE being 8.74% and 8.70% of the average
yield, respectively, and is competitive to other state-of-the-art approaches.",Saeed Khaki; Hieu Pham; Lizhi Wang,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03129v3,False,True,False,False,False,2529.0,Abraham Flaxman,Seattle,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-89779-z,"Yield (engineering), Transfer of learning, Computer science, Agronomy, Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Biology, Materials science, Metallurgy",Syngenta (United States); Iowa State University,"Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, 50011, USA; Syngenta Seeds, Slater, IA, 50244, USA","Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, 50011, USA; Syngenta Seeds, Slater, IA, 50244, USA"
Automating Seccomp Filter Generation for Linux Applications,"Software vulnerabilities in applications undermine the security of
applications. By blocking unused functionality, the impact of potential
exploits can be reduced. While seccomp provides a solution for filtering
syscalls, it requires manual implementation of filter rules for each individual
application. Recent work has investigated automated approaches for detecting
and installing the necessary filter rules. However, as we show, these
approaches make assumptions that are not necessary or require overly
time-consuming analysis.
  In this paper, we propose Chestnut, an automated approach for generating
strict syscall filters for Linux userspace applications with lower requirements
and limitations. Chestnut comprises two phases, with the first phase consisting
of two static components, i.e., a compiler and a binary analyzer, that extract
the used syscalls during compilation or in an analysis of the binary. The
compiler-based approach of Chestnut is up to factor 73 faster than previous
approaches without affecting the accuracy adversely. On the binary analysis
level, we demonstrate that the requirement of position-independent binaries of
related work is not needed, enlarging the set of applications for which
Chestnut is usable. In an optional second phase, Chestnut provides a dynamic
refinement tool that allows restricting the set of allowed syscalls further. We
demonstrate that Chestnut on average blocks 302 syscalls (86.5%) via the
compiler and 288 (82.5%) using the binary-level analysis on a set of 18 widely
used applications. We found that Chestnut blocks the dangerous exec syscall in
50% and 77.7% of the tested applications using the compiler- and binary-based
approach, respectively. For the tested applications, Chestnut prevents
exploitation of more than 62% of the 175 CVEs that target the kernel via
syscalls. Finally, we perform a 6 month long-term study of a sandboxed Nginx
server.",Claudio Canella; Mario Werner; Daniel Gruss; Michael Schwarz,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02554v1,False,True,False,False,False,2540.0,Joe Chestnut,Colorado,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1145/3474123.3486762,"Computer science, Exploit, Blocking (statistics), Task (project management), Filter (signal processing), Software, Secure coding, Software engineering, Embedded system, Work (physics), Distributed computing, Computer security, Software security assurance, Operating system, Information security, Systems engineering, Computer network, Engineering, Security service, Mechanical engineering, Computer vision",Helmholtz Center for Information Security; Graz University of Technology,"Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria; CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, Saarbrücken, Germany","Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria; CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, Saarbrücken, Germany"
Tracking the $\ell_2$ Norm with Constant Update Time,"The \emph{$\ell_2$ tracking problem} is the task of obtaining a streaming

An Australian DER Bill of Rights and Responsibilities,"Australia's world-leading penetration of distributed solar photovoltaics (PV)
is now impacting power system security and as a result how customers can use
and export their own PV-generated energy. Several programs of Australian
regulatory reform for distributed energy resources (DER) have emphasised the
importance of placing consumers at the centre of any energy transition, but
this has occurred against a haphazard backdrop of proposals for solar export
taxes, updated inverter standards, and diminishing feed-in-tariffs. Absent from
the discussion is a coherent espousal of reasonable consumer expectations with
practical technical definitions of how these may be applied. Whilst American
legislation has enshrined initial rights to connect PV, they do not consider
the evolution of rights in a DER-dominated future. This paper proposes a first
attempt at a 'DER Bill of Rights and Responsibilities' for both passive and
active participation in energy markets, using Australia as an example
jurisdiction. The intent is that clarity on rights to self-consumption and
passive participation will support customer trust in the guiderails of active
DER integration and control. Guiding principles are presented with practical
definitions referencing existing instruments including inverter standards,
network connection agreements, the reliability standard, and central ancillary
service markets. We highlight how these proposed rights are already being
breached regularly in Australia, before outlining a pathway to enshrine them
for a DER-dominated future with broad sector endorsement. These questions are
critical for Australia to address now; it is likely other countries will be
required to do so in the near future.",Niraj Lal; Lee Brown,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04855v4,False,True,False,False,False,2547.0,Celeste Carruthers,Atlanta,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2112.04855,"Jurisdiction, CLARITY, Legislation, Business, Law and economics, Political science, Economics, Law, Biochemistry, Chemistry",,,
"The pulse of the city through Twitter: relationships between land use
  and spatiotemporal demographics","Social network data offer interesting opportunities in urban studies. In this
study, we used Twitter data to analyse city dynamics over the course of the
day. Users of this social network were grouped according to city zone and time
slot in order to analyse the daily dynamics of the city and the relationship
between this and land use. First, daytime activity in each zone was compared
with activity at night in order to determine which zones showed increased
activity in each of the time slots. Then, typical Twitter activity profiles
were obtained based on the predominant land use in each zone, indicating how
land uses linked to activities were activated during the day, but at different
rates depending on the type of land use. Lastly, a multiple regression analysis
was performed to determine the influence of the different land uses on each of
the major time slots (morning, afternoon, evening and night) through their
changing coefficients. Activity tended to decrease throughout the day for most
land uses (e.g. offices, education, health and transport), but remained
constant in parks and increased in retail and residential zones. Our results
show that social network data can be used to improve our understanding of the
link between land use and urban dynamics.",Juan Carlos Garcia-Palomares; Maria Henar Salas-Olmedo; Borja Moya-Gomez; Ana Condeco-Melhorado; Javier Gutierrrez,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07956v1,False,True,False,False,False,2550.0,Rachel Meltzer,Boston,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1705.07956,"Demographics, Pulse (music), Geography, Computer science, Demography, Sociology, Telecommunications, Detector",,,
"FUSU: A Multi-temporal-source Land Use Change Segmentation Dataset for
  Fine-grained Urban Semantic Understanding","Fine urban change segmentation using multi-temporal remote sensing images is
essential for understanding human-environment interactions in urban areas.
Although there have been advances in high-quality land cover datasets that
reveal the physical features of urban landscapes, the lack of fine-grained land
use datasets hinders a deeper understanding of how human activities are
distributed across the landscape and the impact of these activities on the
environment, thus constraining proper technique development. To address this,
we introduce FUSU, the first fine-grained land use change segmentation dataset
for Fine-grained Urban Semantic Understanding. FUSU features the most detailed
land use classification system to date, with 17 classes and 30 billion pixels
of annotations. It includes bi-temporal high-resolution satellite images with
0.2-0.5 m ground sample distance and monthly optical and radar satellite time
series, covering 847 km^2 across five urban areas in the southern and northern
of China with different geographical features. The fine-grained land use
pixel-wise annotations and high spatial-temporal resolution data provide a
robust foundation for developing proper deep learning models to provide
contextual insights on human activities and urbanization. To fully leverage
FUSU, we propose a unified time-series architecture for both change detection
and segmentation. We benchmark FUSU on various methods for several tasks.

Rural Healthcare Access and Supply Constraints: A Causal Analysis,"Certificate-of-need (CON) laws require that healthcare providers receive
approval from a state board before offering additional services in a given
community. Proponents of CON laws claim that these laws are needed to prevent
the oversupply of healthcare services in urban areas and to increase access in
rural areas, which are predominantly underserved. Yet, the policy could lower
rural access if used by incumbents to limit entry from competitors. We explore
the repeal of these regulations in five U.S. states to offer the first estimate
of the causal effects of CON laws on rural and urban healthcare access. We find
that repealing CON laws causes a substantial increase in hospitals in both
rural and urban areas. We also find that the repeal leads to fewer beds and
smaller hospitals on average, suggesting an increase in entry and competition
in both rural and urban areas.",Vitor Melo; Liam Sigaud; Elijah Neilson; Markus Bjoerkheim,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08168v1,False,True,False,False,False,2552.0,Alison Davis,Kentucky,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1002/soej.12686,"Repeal, Competitor analysis, Business, Competition (biology), Health care, Rural area, Economic growth, Economics, Law, Political science, Marketing, Ecology, Biology",Clemson University; West Virginia University; Walker (United States); Southern Utah University,"John E.

"A Pathophysiological Model-Driven Communication for Dynamic Distributed
  Medical Best Practice Guidance Systems","There is a great divide between rural and urban areas, particularly in
medical emergency care. Although medical best practice guidelines exist in
hospital handbooks, they are often lengthy and difficult to apply clinically.
The challenges are exaggerated for doctors in rural areas and emergency medical
technicians (EMT) during patient transport.
  In this paper, we propose the concept of distributed executable medical best
practice guidance systems to assist adherence to best practice from the time
that a patient first presents at a rural hospital, through diagnosis and
ambulance transfer to arrival and treatment at a regional tertiary hospital
center. We codify complex medical knowledge in the form of simplified
distributed executable disease automata, from the thin automata at rural
hospitals to the rich automata in the regional center hospitals. However, a
main challenge is how to efficiently and safely synchronize distributed best
practice models as the communication among medical facilities, devices, and
professionals generates a large number of messages. This complex problem of
patient diagnosis and transport from rural to center facility is also fraught
with many uncertainties and changes resulting in a high degree of dynamism. To
address this situation, we propose a pathophysiological model-driven message
exchange communication architecture that ensures the real-time and dynamic
requirements of synchronization among distributed emergency best-practice
models are met in a reliable and safe manner. Taking the signs, symptoms, and
progress of stroke patients transported across a geographically distributed
healthcare network as the motivating use case, we implement our communication
system and apply it to our developed best practice automata using laboratory
simulations. Our proof-of-concept experiments shows there is potential for the
use of our system in a wide variety of domains.",Mohammad Hosseini; Yu Jiang; Poliang Wu; Richard B.

Measuring Gender Bias in Educational Videos: A Case Study on YouTube,"Students are increasingly using online materials to learn new subjects or to
supplement their learning process in educational institutions. Issues regarding
gender bias have been raised in the context of formal education and some
measures have been proposed to mitigate them. However, online educational
materials in terms of possible gender bias and stereotypes which may appear in
different forms are yet to be investigated in the context of search bias in a
widely-used search platform. As a first step towards measuring possible gender
bias in online platforms, we have investigated YouTube educational videos in
terms of the perceived gender of their narrators. We adopted bias measures for
ranked search results to evaluate educational videos returned by YouTube in
response to queries related to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics) and NON-STEM fields of education. Gender is a research area by
itself in social sciences which is beyond the scope of this work. In this
respect, for annotating the perceived gender of the narrator of an
instructional video we used only a crude classification of gender into Male,
and Female. Then, for analysing perceived gender bias we utilised bias measures
that have been inspired by search platforms and further incorporated rank
information into our analysis. Our preliminary results demonstrate that there
is a significant bias towards the male gender on the returned YouTube
educational videos, and the degree of bias varies when we compare STEM and
NON-STEM queries. Finally, there is a strong evidence that rank information
might affect the results.",Gizem Gezici; Yucel Saygin,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09987v1,False,True,False,False,False,2565.0,Mufaddal H Baxamusa,Minnesota,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2206.09987,"Gender bias, Context (archaeology), Affect (linguistics), Scope (computer science), Psychology, Rank (graph theory), Social psychology, Computer science, Mathematics, Geography, Archaeology, Communication, Combinatorics, Programming language",,,

Radial analysis and scaling of housing prices in French urban areas,"Urban scaling laws summarize how urban attributes evolve with city size.
Recent criticism questions notably the aggregate view of this approach, which
leads to neglecting the internal structure of cities. This is all the more
relevant for housing prices due to their important variations across space.
Based on a dataset compiling millions of real estate transactions over the
period 2017-2021, we investigate the regularities of the radial
(center-periphery) profiles of housing prices across cities, with respect to
their size. Results are threefold. First, they corroborate prior findings in
the urban scaling literature stating that largest cities agglomerate higher
housing prices. Second, we find that housing price radial profiles scale in
three dimensions with the power 1/5 of city population. After rescaling, great
regularities between radial profiles can be observed, although some locational
amenities have a significant impact on prices. Third, it appears that our
rescaled profiles approach fails to explain housing price variations in the
city center across cities. In fact, prices near the city center rise much
faster with city size than those in the periphery. This has strong implications
for low-income households seeking homeownership, because prohibitive prices in
the center may contribute to pushing them out into peripheral locations.",Gaëtan Laziou; Rémi Lemoy; Marion Le Texier,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14503v1,False,True,False,False,False,2582.0,Ning Zhang,Penn State,Completed,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1177/23998083241281890,"Scaling, Economic geography, Geography, Economics, Mathematics, Geometry",Université de Rouen Normandie,"University Montpellier 3, France; University of Rouen, France","University Montpellier 3, France; University of Rouen, France"

The parenthood effect in urban mobility,"The modelling of human mobility is vital for the understanding of the
complexity of urban dynamics and guiding effective interventions to improve
quality of life. Traditional modelling approaches focus on `average citizens,'
which overlook the multitude of experiences from distinct sociodemographic
groups. Recent studies have unveiled significant variations in mobility
patterns related to gender and socioeconomic status, yet the impact of
parenthood remains under-explored. Parenthood brings profound changes to daily
routines, influenced by factors such as increased caregiving responsibilities,
altered work-life balance, and the need for family-friendly environments.
Parents often prioritise considerations such as cost of living, social
wellbeing, environmental quality, and safety. Quantifying how `friendly' a city
is becomes more and more important for parents, especially in the context of
rising remote work opportunities which, in turn, reverberate on the choices on
where to settle. This work investigates whether these considerations lead to
distinct mobility patterns between parents and non-parents, also accounting for
the impact of partnership. Using extensive census data across American cities,
we analyse how parenthood and partnership reshape their urban experiences. Our
findings indicate that cities can indeed be classified by their level of
friendliness towards parents and partners. For example, Dallas and Nashville
can be more suited for single individuals, New York and Chicago can be more
accommodating to parents, while Washington and Baltimore favour married people.
These insights contribute to the growing body of research advocating for more
nuanced and equitable urban planning. By recognising the diverse needs of
different demographic groups, particularly parents, our study underscores the
importance of tailored urban design strategies over universal solutions.",Mariana Macedo; Ronaldo Menezes; Alessio Cardillo,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02299v1,False,True,False,False,False,2593.0,Brenden D Timpe,Nebraska,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2501.02299,"Demographic economics, Business, Economics",,,
"Enrollment Forecast for Clinical Trials at the Portfolio Planning Phase
  Based on Site-Level Historical Data","Accurate forecast of a clinical trial enrollment timeline at the planning
phase is of great importance to both corporate strategic planning and trial
operational excellence. While predictions of key milestones such as last
subject first dose date can inform strategic decision-making, detailed
predictive insights (e.g., median number of enrolled subjects by month for a
country) can facilitate the planning of clinical trial operation activities and
promote execution excellence. The naive approach often calculates an average
enrollment rate from historical data and generates an inaccurate prediction
based on a linear trend with the average rate. The traditional statistical
approach utilizes the simple Poisson-Gamma model that assumes time-invariant
site activation rates and it can fail to capture the underlying nonlinear
patterns (e.g., up and down site activation pattern). We present a novel
statistical approach based on generalized linear mixed-effects models and the
use of non-homogeneous Poisson processes through Bayesian framework to model
the country initiation, site activation and subject enrollment sequentially in
a systematic fashion. We validate the performance of our proposed enrollment
modeling framework based on a set of preselected 25 studies from four
therapeutic areas. Our modeling framework shows a substantial improvement in
prediction accuracy in comparison to the traditional statistical approach.
Furthermore, we show that our modeling and simulation approach calibrates the
data variability appropriately and gives correct coverage rates for prediction
intervals of various nominal levels. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our
approach to generate the predicted enrollment curves through time with
confidence bands overlaid.",Sheng Zhong; Yunzhao Xing; Mengjia Yu; Li Wang,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01351v1,False,True,False,False,False,2600.0,Andrea Wysocki,Chicago,Completed,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/pst.2343,"Computer science, Poisson distribution, Portfolio, Bayesian probability, Timeline, Data set, Statistical model, Random effects model, Data mining, Econometrics, Statistics, Machine learning, Artificial intelligence, Mathematics, Meta-analysis, Medicine, Financial economics, Internal medicine, Economics",AbbVie (United States),"Statistical Innovation Group, Data and Statistical Sciences, AbbVie Inc.

Measurement Models For Sailboats Price vs. Features And Regional Areas,"In this study, we investigated the relationship between sailboat technical
specifications and their prices, as well as regional pricing influences.
Utilizing a dataset encompassing characteristics like length, beam, draft,
displacement, sail area, and waterline, we applied multiple machine learning
models to predict sailboat prices. The gradient descent model demonstrated
superior performance, producing the lowest MSE and MAE. Our analysis revealed
that monohulled boats are generally more affordable than catamarans, and that
certain specifications such as length, beam, displacement, and sail area
directly correlate with higher prices. Interestingly, lower draft was
associated with higher listing prices. We also explored regional price
determinants and found that the United States tops the list in average sailboat
prices, followed by Europe, Hong Kong, and the Caribbean. Contrary to our
initial hypothesis, a country's GDP showed no direct correlation with sailboat
prices. Utilizing a 50% cross-validation method, our models yielded consistent
results across test groups. Our research offers a machine learning-enhanced

Obamacare and a Fix for the IRS Iteration,"We model the quantities appearing in Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax
guidance for calculating the health insurance premium tax credit created by the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare. We ask the
question of whether there is a procedure, computable by hand, which can
calculate the appropriate premium tax credit for any household with
self-employment income. We motivate current IRS tax guidance, which has had
self-employed taxpayers use a fixed point iteration to calculate their premium
tax credits since 2014. Then, we give an example showing that the IRS iteration
can lead to a divergent sequence of iterates. As a consequence, IRS guidance
does not calculate appropriate premium tax credits for tax returns in certain
income intervals, adversely affecting eligible beneficiaries. A bisection
procedure for calculating premium tax credits is proposed. We prove that this
procedure calculates appropriate premium tax credits for a model of simple tax
returns. This is generalized to the case where premium tax credits are received
in advance, which is the most common one in applications. We outline the
problem of calculating appropriate premium tax credits for models of general
tax returns. While the bisection procedure will work with the tax code in its
current configuration, it could fail, eg, in states which have not expanded

"On the Potential and Limitations of Few-Shot In-Context Learning to
  Generate Metamorphic Specifications for Tax Preparation Software","Due to the ever-increasing complexity of income tax laws in the United
States, the number of US taxpayers filing their taxes using tax preparation
software (henceforth, tax software) continues to increase. According to the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in FY22, nearly 50% of taxpayers filed
their individual income taxes using tax software. Given the legal consequences
of incorrectly filing taxes for the taxpayer, ensuring the correctness of tax
software is of paramount importance. Metamorphic testing has emerged as a
leading solution to test and debug legal-critical tax software due to the
absence of correctness requirements and trustworthy datasets. The key idea
behind metamorphic testing is to express the properties of a system in terms of
the relationship between one input and its slightly metamorphosed twinned
input. Extracting metamorphic properties from IRS tax publications is a tedious
and time-consuming process. As a response, this paper formulates the task of
generating metamorphic specifications as a translation task between properties
extracted from tax documents - expressed in natural language - to a contrastive
first-order logic form. We perform a systematic analysis on the potential and
limitations of in-context learning with Large Language Models(LLMs) for this
task, and outline a research agenda towards automating the generation of
metamorphic specifications for tax preparation software.",Dananjay Srinivas; Rohan Das; Saeid Tizpaz-Niari; Ashutosh Trivedi; Maria Leonor Pacheco,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11979v1,False,True,False,False,False,2605.0,Troup Howard,Utah,Active,,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2023.nllp-1.23,"Computer science, Taxpayer, Correctness, Tax reform, Economics, Programming language, Public economics, Macroeconomics",University of Colorado System; The University of Texas at El Paso; University of Colorado Boulder,University of Texas El Paso; University of Colorado Boulder,University of Texas El Paso; University of Colorado Boulder
Supervised learning for the prediction of firm dynamics,"Thanks to the increasing availability of granular, yet high-dimensional, firm
level data, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been successfully applied to
address multiple research questions related to firm dynamics. Especially
supervised learning (SL), the branch of ML dealing with the prediction of
labelled outcomes, has been used to better predict firms' performance. In this
contribution, we will illustrate a series of SL approaches to be used for
prediction tasks, relevant at different stages of the company life cycle. The
stages we will focus on are (i) startup and innovation, (ii) growth and
performance of companies, and (iii) firms exit from the market. First, we
review SL implementations to predict successful startups and R&D projects.
Next, we describe how SL tools can be used to analyze company growth and
performance. Finally, we review SL applications to better forecast financial
distress and company failure. In the concluding Section, we extend the

"Venture Capital investments through the lens of Network and Functional
  Data Analysis","In this paper we characterize the performance of venture capital-backed firms
based on their ability to attract investment. The aim of the study is to
identify relevant predictors of success built from the network structure of
firms' and investors' relations. Focusing on deal-level data for the health
sector, we first create a bipartite network among firms and investors, and then
apply functional data analysis (FDA) to derive progressively more refined
indicators of success captured by a binary, a scalar and a functional outcome.
More specifically, we use different network centrality measures to capture the
role of early investments for the success of the firm. Our results, which are
robust to different specifications, suggest that success has a strong positive
association with centrality measures of the firm and of its large investors,
and a weaker but still detectable association with centrality measures of small
investors and features describing firms as knowledge bridges. Finally, based on
our analyses, success is not associated with firms' and investors' spreading
power (harmonic centrality), nor with the tightness of investors' community
(clustering coefficient) and spreading ability (VoteRank).",Christian Esposito; Marco Gortan; Lorenzo Testa; Francesca Chiaromonte; Giorgio Fagiolo; Andrea Mina; Giulio Rossetti,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12859v2,False,True,False,False,False,2627.0,Federico Esposito,Boston,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-022-00482-y,"Venture capital, Network analysis, Lens (geology), Business, Economics, Finance, Optics, Engineering, Electrical engineering, Physics","Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Bocconi University; University of Cambridge; Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione ""Alessandro Faedo""; National Research Council","Institute of Economics and EMbeDS, Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies, Pisa, Italy; Centre for Business Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK; Bocconi University, Milan, Italy; Institute of Information Science and Technologies “A.

"City-Scale Assessment of Pedestrian Exposure to Air Pollution: A Case
  Study in Barcelona","Air pollution is a pressing environmental risk to public health, particularly
in cities where population density and pollution levels are high. Traditional
methods for exposure analysis often rely on census data, but recent studies
highlight the impact of daily mobility on individuals' exposure. Here, we
develop a methodology to determine unprecedented pedestrian exposure estimates
at the city scale by combining sidewalk pedestrian flows with high-resolution
(25 m x 25 m) NO2 data from bias-corrected predictions of the air quality
system CALIOPE-Urban. Applied to Barcelona (Spain) for the year 2019, we show
that pedestrian flow and NO2 levels exhibit negligible temporal correlation.
While short-term (hourly) exposure is driven by pedestrian mobility, long-term
(monthly) exposure is dominated by NO2 patterns. We identify strong spatial
gradients of exposure, highlighting the importance for high-resolution
solutions at the sidewalks scale. Finally, we determine that exposure
mitigation strategies should consider different citizen subgroups based on
their mobility and preferred routes, as significant differences were found
between residential and pedestrian exposure. Our results provide exposure
indicators designed for city planners and policymakers, helping to prioritize
mitigation measures where and when they are most needed.",Jan Mateu Armengol; Cristina Carnerero; Clément Rames; Álvaro Criado; Javier Borge-Holthoefer; Albert Soret; Albert Solé-Ribalta,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22015v1,False,True,False,False,False,2644.0,Catherine L Connolly,Baruch,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2410.22015,"Pedestrian, Scale (ratio), Air pollution, Environmental science, Pollution, Environmental planning, Geography, Cartography, Archaeology, Chemistry, Ecology, Organic chemistry, Biology",,,
"Efficient Economic Model Predictive Control of Water Treatment Process
  with Learning-based Koopman Operator","Used water treatment plays a pivotal role in advancing environmental
sustainability. Economic model predictive control holds the promise of
enhancing the overall operational performance of the water treatment
facilities. In this study, we propose a data-driven economic predictive control
approach within the Koopman modeling framework. First, we propose a deep
learning-enabled input-output Koopman modeling approach, which predicts the
overall economic operational cost of the wastewater treatment process based on
input data and available output measurements that are directly linked to the
operational costs. Subsequently, by leveraging this learned input-output
Koopman model, a convex economic predictive control scheme is developed. The
resulting predictive control problem can be efficiently solved by leveraging
quadratic programming solvers, and complex non-convex optimization problems are
bypassed. The proposed method is applied to a benchmark wastewater treatment
process. The proposed method significantly improves the overall economic
operational performance of the water treatment process. Additionally, the
computational efficiency of the proposed method is significantly enhanced as

"Safety-margin-based design and redesign considering mixed epistemic
  model uncertainty and aleatory parameter uncertainty","At the initial design stage engineers often rely on low-fidelity models that
have high epistemic uncertainty. Traditional safety-margin-based deterministic
design resorts to testing (e.g. prototype experiment, evaluation of
high-fidelity simulation, etc.) to reduce epistemic uncertainty and achieve
targeted levels of safety. Testing is used to calibrate models and prescribe
redesign when tests are not passed. After calibration, reduced epistemic model
uncertainty can be leveraged through redesign to restore safety or improve
design performance; however, redesign may be associated with substantial costs
or delays. In this paper, a methodology is described for optimizing the
safety-margin-based design, testing, and redesign process to allow the designer
to tradeoff between the risk of future redesign and the possible performance
and reliability benefits. The proposed methodology represents the epistemic
model uncertainty with a Kriging surrogate and is applicable in a wide range of
design problems. The method is illustrated on a cantilever beam bending example
and then a sounding rocket example. It is shown that redesign acts as a type of
quality control measure to prevent an undesirable initial design from being
accepted as the final design. It is found that the optimal design/redesign
strategy for maximizing expected design performance includes not only redesign
to correct an initial design that is later revealed to be unsafe, but also
redesign to improve performance when an initial design is later revealed to be
too conservative (e.g. too heavy).",Nathaniel B. Price; Mathieu Balesdent; Sébastien Defoort; Rodolphe Le Riche; Nam H. Kim; Raphael T.

"Identification of the Breach of Short-term Rental Regulations in Irish
  Rent Pressure Zones","The housing crisis in Ireland has rapidly grown in recent years. To make a
more significant profit, many landlords are no longer renting out their houses
under long-term tenancies but under short-term tenancies. The shift from
long-term to short-term rentals has harmed the supply of private housing
rentals. Regulating rentals in Rent Pressure Zones with the highest and rising
rents is becoming a tricky issue.
  In this paper, we develop a breach identifier to check short-term rentals
located in Rent Pressure Zones with potential breaches only using publicly
available data from Airbnb (an online marketplace focused on short-term
home-stays). First, we use a Residual Neural Network to filter out outdoor
landscape photos that negatively impact identifying whether an owner has
multiple rentals in a Rent Pressure Zone. Second, a Siamese Neural Network is
used to compare the similarity of indoor photos to determine if multiple rental
posts correspond to the same residence. Next, we use the Haversine algorithm to
locate short-term rentals within a circle centered on the coordinate of a
permit. Short-term rentals with a permit will not be restricted. Finally, we
improve the occupancy estimation model combined with sentiment analysis, which
may provide higher accuracy.
  Because Airbnb does not disclose accurate house coordinates and occupancy
data, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of our breach identifier. The
accuracy of the occupancy estimator cannot be verified either. It only provides
an estimate within a reasonable range. Users should be skeptical of short-term
rentals that are flagged as possible breaches.",Guowen Liu; Inmaculada Arnedillo-Sanchez; Zhenshuo Chen,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16617v1,False,True,False,False,False,2661.0,Christina Stacy,Georgetown,Active,,https://doi.org/10.4236/jcc.2023.112002,"Renting, Economic rent, Term (time), Business, Irish, Identification (biology), Finance, Economics, Engineering, Microeconomics, Linguistics, Philosophy, Civil engineering, Physics, Botany, Quantum mechanics, Biology",Dublin City University; Trinity College Dublin,"Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland","Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland"
"PatentMiner: Patent Vacancy Mining via Context-enhanced and
  Knowledge-guided Graph Attention","Although there are a small number of work to conduct patent research by
building knowledge graph, but without constructing patent knowledge graph using
patent documents and combining latest natural language processing methods to
mine hidden rich semantic relationships in existing patents and predict new
possible patents. In this paper, we propose a new patent vacancy prediction
approach named PatentMiner to mine rich semantic knowledge and predict new
potential patents based on knowledge graph (KG) and graph attention mechanism.
Firstly, patent knowledge graph over time (e.g. year) is constructed by
carrying out named entity recognition and relation extrac-tion from patent
documents. Secondly, Common Neighbor Method (CNM), Graph Attention Networks
(GAT) and Context-enhanced Graph Attention Networks (CGAT) are proposed to
perform link prediction in the constructed knowledge graph to dig out the
potential triples. Finally, patents are defined on the knowledge graph by means
of co-occurrence relationship, that is, each patent is represented as a fully
connected subgraph containing all its entities and co-occurrence relationships
of the patent in the knowledge graph; Furthermore, we propose a new patent
prediction task which predicts a fully connected subgraph with newly added
prediction links as a new pa-tent. The experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed patent predic-tion approach can correctly predict new patents and
Context-enhanced Graph Attention Networks is much better than the baseline.

The evolving boundary of green technology,"Green patents are a key indicator to track technological efforts aimed at
fighting climate change. Using an original dataset that merges different
Patstat releases, we identify three mechanisms that may bias green patent
statistics, potentially leading to contradictory findings. First, patent
reclassifications due to updates in (green) classification codes result in an
9.2\% increase in the number of green patents when using the most recent
classification structure. Second, delays in the adoption of the Cooperative
Patent Classification (CPC) system introduce regional biases, as approximately
10\% of green patents from late-adopting countries remain undetected in less
recent versions of the database. Third, we provide evidence that quality
thresholds used to identify high-value inventions significantly shape observed
trends in green patenting. Analyzing these mechanisms, our paper reveals that
in many studies a substantial number of green patents is systematically
overlooked, with the strongest effects observed for recent years and patents
originating from Asian patent offices. These findings lead to relevant policy
implications. Our results indicate not only that the global rate of green
innovation has accelerated, but also that its epicenter has shifted, with an

Completeness Thresholds for Memory Safety of Array Traversing Programs,"We report on intermediate results of -- to the best of our knowledge -- the

"AEGIS: Towards Formalized and Practical Memory-Safe Execution of C
  programs via MSWASM","Programs written in unsafe languages such as C are prone to memory safety
errors, which can lead to program compromises and serious real-world security
consequences. Recently, Memory-Safe WebAssembly (MSWASM) is introduced as a
general-purpose intermediate bytecode with built-in memory safety semantics.
Programs written in C can be compiled into MSWASM to get complete memory safety
protection. In this paper, we present our extensions on MSWASM, which improve
its semantics and practicality. First, we formalize MSWASM semantics in
Coq/Iris, extending it with inter-module interaction, showing that MSWASM
provides fine-grained isolation guarantees analogous to WASM's coarse-grained
isolation via linear memory. Second, we present Aegis, a system to adopt the

Evaluating utility in synthetic banking microdata applications,"Financial regulators such as central banks collect vast amounts of data, but
access to the resulting fine-grained banking microdata is severely restricted
by banking secrecy laws. Recent developments have resulted in mechanisms that
generate faithful synthetic data, but current evaluation frameworks lack a
focus on the specific challenges of banking institutions and microdata. We
develop a framework that considers the utility and privacy requirements of
regulators, and apply this to financial usage indices, term deposit yield
curves, and credit card transition matrices. Using the Central Bank of
Paraguay's data, we provide the first implementation of synthetic banking
microdata using a central bank's collected information, with the resulting
synthetic datasets for all three domain applications being publicly available
and featuring information not yet released in statistical disclosure. We find
that applications less susceptible to post-processing information loss, which
are based on frequency tables, are particularly suited for this approach, and
that marginal-based inference mechanisms to outperform generative adversarial
network models for these applications. Our results demonstrate that synthetic
data generation is a promising privacy-enhancing technology for financial
regulators seeking to complement their statistical disclosure, while
highlighting the crucial role of evaluating such endeavors in terms of utility
and privacy requirements.",Hugo E.

American Hate Crime Trends Prediction with Event Extraction,"Social media platforms may provide potential space for discourses that
contain hate speech, and even worse, can act as a propagation mechanism for
hate crimes. The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program collects hate
crime data and releases statistic report yearly. These statistics provide
information in determining national hate crime trends. The statistics can also
provide valuable holistic and strategic insight for law enforcement agencies or
justify lawmakers for specific legislation. However, the reports are mostly
released next year and lag behind many immediate needs. Recent research mainly
focuses on hate speech detection in social media text or empirical studies on
the impact of a confirmed crime. This paper proposes a framework that first
utilizes text mining techniques to extract hate crime events from New York
Times news, then uses the results to facilitate predicting American
national-level and state-level hate crime trends. Experimental results show
that our method can significantly enhance the prediction performance compared
with time series or regression methods without event-related factors. Our
framework broadens the methods of national-level and state-level hate crime
trends prediction.",Songqiao Han; Hailiang Huang; Jiangwei Liu; Shengsheng Xiao,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04951v1,False,True,False,False,False,2687.0,Sylwia Piatkowska,Florida,Active,,,"Hate crime, Event (particle physics), Criminology, Extraction (chemistry), Political science, Computer science, Psychology, Chromatography, Astrophysics, Physics, Chemistry",,,
"Deep Contrastive Learning for Feature Alignment: Insights from
  Housing-Household Relationship Inference","Housing and household characteristics are key determinants of social and
economic well-being, yet our understanding of their interrelationships remains
limited. This study addresses this knowledge gap by developing a deep
contrastive learning (DCL) model to infer housing-household relationships using
the American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS). More
broadly, the proposed model is suitable for a class of problems where the goal
is to learn joint relationships between two distinct entities without
explicitly labeled ground truth data. Our proposed dual-encoder DCL approach
leverages co-occurrence patterns in PUMS and introduces a bisect K-means
clustering method to overcome the absence of ground truth labels. The
dual-encoder DCL architecture is designed to handle the semantic differences
between housing (building) and household (people) features while mitigating
noise introduced by clustering. To validate the model, we generate a synthetic
ground truth dataset and conduct comprehensive evaluations. The model further
demonstrates its superior performance in capturing housing-household
relationships in Delaware compared to state-of-the-art methods. A
transferability test in North Carolina confirms its generalizability across
diverse sociodemographic and geographic contexts. Finally, the post-hoc
explainable AI analysis using SHAP values reveals that tenure status and
mortgage information play a more significant role in housing-household matching
than traditionally emphasized factors such as the number of persons and rooms.",Xiao Qian; Shangjia Dong; Rachel Davidson,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11205v1,False,True,False,False,True,2689.0,AJ Golio,Atlanta,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2502.11205,"Inference, Feature (linguistics), Artificial intelligence, Deep learning, Computer science, Machine learning, Natural language processing, Linguistics, Philosophy",,,
"Machine Learning Analysis of the Impact of Increasing the Minimum Wage
  on Income Inequality in Spain from 2001 to 2021","This paper analyzes the impact of the National Minimum Wage from 2001 to
2021. The MNW increased from 505.7/month (2001) to 1,108.3/month (2021). Using
the data provided by the Spanish Tax Administration Agency, databases that
represent the entire population studied can be analyzed. More accurate results
and more efficient predictive models are provided by these counts. This work is
characterized by the database used, which is a national census and not a sample
or projection. Therefore, the study reflects results and analyses based on
historical data from the Spanish Salary Census 2001-2021. Various
machine-learning models show that income inequality has been reduced by raising
the minimum wage. Raising the minimum wage has not led to inflation or
increased unemployment. On the contrary, it has been consistent with increased
net employment, contained prices, and increased corporate profit margins. The
most important conclusion is that an increase in the minimum wage in the period
analyzed has led to an increase in the wealth of the country, increasing
employment and company profits, and is postulated, under the conditions
analyzed, as an effective method for the redistribution of wealth.",Marcos Lacasa Cazcarra,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02402v1,False,True,False,False,False,2693.0,David Neumark,Irvine,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2402.02402,"Minimum wage, Inequality, Economic inequality, Economics, Labour economics, Wage inequality, Demographic economics, Wage, Mathematics, Mathematical analysis",,,
"Causal exposure-response curve estimation with surrogate confounders: a
  study of air pollution and children's health in Medicaid claims data","In this paper, we undertake a case study to estimate a causal
exposure-response function (ERF) for long-term exposure to fine particulate
matter (PM$_{2.5}$) and respiratory hospitalizations in socioeconomically
disadvantaged children using nationwide Medicaid claims data. These data
present specific challenges. First, family income-based Medicaid eligibility
criteria for children differ by state, creating socioeconomically distinct
populations and leading to clustered data. Second, Medicaid enrollees'
socioeconomic status, a confounder and an effect modifier of the
exposure-response relationships under study, is not measured. However, two
surrogates are available: median household income of each enrollee's zip code
and state-level Medicaid family income eligibility thresholds for children. We
introduce a customized approach for causal ERF estimation called MedMatch,
building on generalized propensity score (GPS) matching methods. MedMatch
adapts these methods to (1) leverage the surrogate variables to account for
potential confounding and/or effect modification by socioeconomic status and
(2) address practical challenges presented by differing exposure distributions
across clusters. We also propose a new hyperparameter selection criterion for
MedMatch and traditional GPS matching methods. Through extensive simulation
studies, we demonstrate the strong performance of MedMatch relative to
conventional approaches in this setting. We apply MedMatch to estimate the
causal ERF between PM$_{2.5}$ and respiratory hospitalization among children in
Medicaid, 2000-2012. We find a positive association, with a steeper curve at
lower PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations that levels off at higher concentrations.",Jenny J. Lee; Xiao Wu; Francesca Dominici; Rachel C.

Tax Mechanisms and Gradient Flows,"We demonstrate how a static optimal income taxation problem can be analyzed
using dynamical methods. Specifically, we show that the taxation problem is
intimately connected to the heat equation. Our first result is a new property
of the optimal tax which we call the fairness principle. The optimal tax at any
income is invariant under a family of properly adjusted Gaussian averages (the
heat kernel) of the optimal taxes at other incomes. That is, the optimal tax at
a given income is equal to the weighted by the heat kernels average of optimal
taxes at other incomes and income densities. Moreover, this averaging happens
at every scale tightly linked to each other providing a unified weighting
scheme at all income ranges. The fairness principle arises not due to equality
considerations but rather it represents an efficient way to smooth the burden
of taxes and generated revenues across incomes. Just as nature wants to
distribute heat evenly, the optimal way for a government to raise revenues is
to distribute the tax burden and raised revenues evenly among individuals. We
then construct a gradient flow of taxes -- a dynamic process changing the
existing tax system in the direction of the increase in tax revenues -- and
show that it takes the form of a heat equation. The fairness principle holds
also for the short-term asymptotics of the gradient flow, where the averaging
is done over the current taxes. The gradient flow we consider can be viewed as
a continuous process of a reform of the nonlinear income tax schedule and thus
unifies the variational approach to taxation and optimal taxation. We present
several other characteristics of the gradient flow focusing on its smoothing
properties.",Stefan Steinerberger; Aleh Tsyvinski,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.13276v1,False,True,False,False,False,2697.0,Alexander Siebert,Atlanta,Active,,https://doi.org/10.3386/w25821,Business,Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Yale University Box 208268 New Haven, CT 06520-8268; Yale University Department of Mathematics 10 Hillhouse Avenue New Haven, CT 06510","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Yale University Box 208268 New Haven, CT 06520-8268; Yale University Department of Mathematics 10 Hillhouse Avenue New Haven, CT 06510"
"Business and Regulatory Responses to Artificial Intelligence: Dynamic
  Regulation, Innovation Ecosystems and the Strategic Management of Disruptive
  Technology","Identifying and then implementing an effective response to disruptive new AI
technologies is enormously challenging for any business looking to integrate AI
into their operations, as well as regulators looking to leverage AI-related
innovation as a mechanism for achieving regional economic growth. These
business and regulatory challenges are particularly significant given the broad
reach of AI, as well as the multiple uncertainties surrounding such
technologies and their future development and effects. This article identifies
two promising strategies for meeting the AI challenge, focusing on the example
of Fintech. First, dynamic regulation, in the form of regulatory sandboxes and
other regulatory approaches that aim to provide a space for responsible
AI-related innovation. An empirical study provides preliminary evidence to
suggest that jurisdictions that adopt a more proactive approach to Fintech
regulation can attract greater investment. The second strategy relates to
so-called innovation ecosystems. It is argued that such ecosystems are most
effective when they afford opportunities for creative partnerships between
well-established corporations and AI-focused startups and that this aspect of a
successful innovation ecosystem is often overlooked in the existing discussion.
The article suggests that these two strategies are interconnected, in that
greater investment is an important element in both fostering and signaling a
well-functioning innovation ecosystem and that a well-functioning ecosystem
will, in turn, attract more funding. The resulting synergies between these
strategies can, therefore, provide a jurisdiction with a competitive edge in
becoming a regional hub for AI-related activity.",Mark Fenwick; Erik P. M.

"Global evidence on the income elasticity of willingness to pay, relative
  price changes and public natural capital values","While the global economy continues to grow, ecosystem services tend to
stagnate or decline. Economic theory has shown how such shifts in relative
scarcities can be reflected in project appraisal and accounting, but empirical
evidence has been sparse to put theory into practice. To estimate relative
price changes in ecosystem services to be used for making such adjustments, we
perform a global meta-analysis of contingent valuation studies to derive income
elasticities of marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for ecosystem services to
proxy the degree of limited substitutability. Based on 735 income-WTP pairs
from 396 studies, we find an income elasticity of WTP of around 0.6. Combined
with good-specific growth rates, we estimate relative price change of ecosystem
services of around 1.7 percent per year. In an application to natural capital
valuation of forest ecosystem services by the World Bank, we show that natural
capital should be uplifted by around 40 percent. Our assessment of aggregate
public natural capital yields a larger value adjustment of between 58 and 97
percent, depending on the discount rate. We discuss implications for policy
appraisal and for estimates of natural capital in comprehensive wealth
accounts.",Moritz A. Drupp; Zachary M.

"Hyperspectral Unmixing Overview: Geometrical, Statistical, and Sparse
  Regression-Based Approaches","Imaging spectrometers measure electromagnetic energy scattered in their
instantaneous field view in hundreds or thousands of spectral channels with
higher spectral resolution than multispectral cameras. Imaging spectrometers
are therefore often referred to as hyperspectral cameras (HSCs). Higher
spectral resolution enables material identification via spectroscopic analysis,
which facilitates countless applications that require identifying materials in
scenarios unsuitable for classical spectroscopic analysis. Due to low spatial
resolution of HSCs, microscopic material mixing, and multiple scattering,
spectra measured by HSCs are mixtures of spectra of materials in a scene. Thus,
accurate estimation requires unmixing. Pixels are assumed to be mixtures of a
few materials, called endmembers. Unmixing involves estimating all or some of:
the number of endmembers, their spectral signatures, and their abundances at
each pixel. Unmixing is a challenging, ill-posed inverse problem because of
model inaccuracies, observation noise, environmental conditions, endmember
variability, and data set size. Researchers have devised and investigated many
models searching for robust, stable, tractable, and accurate unmixing
algorithms. This paper presents an overview of unmixing methods from the time
of Keshava and Mustard's unmixing tutorial [1] to the present. Mixing models
are first discussed. Signal-subspace, geometrical, statistical, sparsity-based,
and spatial-contextual unmixing algorithms are described. Mathematical problems

Remote Mentoring Young Females in STEM through MAGIC,"The limited representation of women in STEM workforce is a concerning
national issue. It has been found that the gender stratification is not due to
the lack of talent amongst young females, but due to the lack of access to

offer nation-wide personalized STEM mentoring to young females from all
segments of the society. In this paper, we introduce MAGIC, an organization
dedicated to mentoring young females in STEM through remote methods. We conduct
a retrospective study of MAGIC's formative years and present our experience in
remotely establishing 23 highly tailored mentor-mentee pairs. We provide

Understanding Childhood Vulnerability in The City of Surrey,"Understanding the community conditions that best support universal access and

combining data derived from both public and private sources. In one approach,
we find specifically that the Early Development Instrument measuring childhood
vulnerabilities across varying domains can be used to cluster neighborhoods,
and that census variables can help explain similarities between neighborhoods
within these clusters. In our second approach, we use program registration data
from the City of Surrey's Community and Recreation Services Division. We also
find a critical age of entry and exit for each program related to early
childhood development and beyond, and find that certain neighborhoods and
recreational programs have larger retention rates than others. This report

Situated Live Programming for Human-Robot Collaboration,"We present situated live programming for human-robot collaboration, an
approach that enables users with limited programming experience to program
collaborative applications for human-robot interaction. Allowing end users,
such as shop floor workers, to program collaborative robots themselves would
make it easy to ""retask"" robots from one process to another, facilitating their
adoption by small and medium enterprises. Our approach builds on the paradigm
of trigger-action programming (TAP) by allowing end users to create rich
interactions through simple trigger-action pairings. It enables end users to
iteratively create, edit, and refine a reactive robot program while executing
partial programs. This live programming approach enables the user to utilize
the task space and objects by incrementally specifying situated trigger-action
pairs, substantially lowering the barrier to entry for programming or
reprogramming robots for collaboration. We instantiate situated live
programming in an authoring system where users can create trigger-action
programs by annotating an augmented video feed from the robot's perspective and
assign robot actions to trigger conditions. We evaluated this system in a study
where participants (n = 10) developed robot programs for solving collaborative
light-manufacturing tasks. Results showed that users with little programming
experience were able to program HRC tasks in an interactive fashion and our
situated live programming approach further supported individualized strategies
and workflows. We conclude by discussing opportunities and limitations of the
proposed approach, our system implementation, and our study and discuss a
roadmap for expanding this approach to a broader range of tasks and
applications.",Emmanuel Senft; Michael Hagenow; Robert Radwin; Michael Zinn; Michael Gleicher; Bilge Mutlu,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03592v1,False,True,False,False,False,2711.0,Nancey G Leigh,Atlanta,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1145/3472749.3474773,"Situated, Programming by demonstration, Computer science, Human–computer interaction, Robot, Action (physics), Workflow, Process (computing), Multimedia, Artificial intelligence, Programming language, Physics, Quantum mechanics, Database",University of Wisconsin–Madison,"Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, United States; Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, United States; Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, United States","Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, United States; Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, United States; Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, United States"
"Quantitative law describing market dynamics before and after

Federal Reserve rate change causes a financial shock, where the dynamics after
the announcement is described by an analogue of the Omori earthquake law. We
quantify the rate n(t) of aftershocks following an interest rate change at time
T, and find power-law decay which scales as n(t-T) (t-T)^-$\Omega$, with
$\Omega$ positive. Surprisingly, we find that the same law describes the rate
n'(|t-T|) of ""pre-shocks"" before the interest rate change at time T. This is
the first study to quantitatively relate the size of the market response to the
news which caused the shock and to uncover the presence of quantifiable
preshocks. We demonstrate that the news associated with interest rate change is
responsible for causing both the anticipation before the announcement and the
surprise after the announcement. We estimate the magnitude of financial news
using the relative difference between the U. S. Treasury Bill and the Federal

Universal Voting Protocol Tweaks to Make Manipulation Hard,"Voting is a general method for preference aggregation in multiagent settings,
but seminal results have shown that all (nondictatorial) voting protocols are
manipulable. One could try to avoid manipulation by using voting protocols
where determining a beneficial manipulation is hard computationally. A number
of recent papers study the complexity of manipulating existing protocols. This
paper is the first work to take the next step of designing new protocols that
are especially hard to manipulate. Rather than designing these new protocols
from scratch, we instead show how to tweak existing protocols to make
manipulation hard, while leaving much of the original nature of the protocol
intact. The tweak studied consists of adding one elimination preround to the
election. Surprisingly, this extremely simple and universal tweak makes typical
protocols hard to manipulate! The protocols become NP-hard, #P-hard, or
PSPACE-hard to manipulate, depending on whether the schedule of the preround is
determined before the votes are collected, after the votes are collected, or
the scheduling and the vote collecting are interleaved, respectively. We prove
general sufficient conditions on the protocols for this tweak to introduce the

"A data-driven econo-financial stress-testing framework to estimate the
  effect of supply chain networks on financial systemic risk","Supply chain disruptions constitute an often underestimated risk for
financial stability. As in financial networks, systemic risks in production
networks arises when the local failure of one firm impacts the production of
others and might trigger cascading disruptions that affect significant parts of
the economy. Here, we study how systemic risk in production networks translates
into financial systemic risk through a mechanism where supply chain contagion
leads to correlated bank-firm loan defaults. We propose a financial
stress-testing framework for micro- and macro-prudential applications that
features a national firm level supply chain network in combination with
interbank network layers. The model is calibrated by using a unique data set
including about 1 million firm-level supply links, practically all bank-firm
loans, and all interbank loans in a small European economy. As a showcase we
implement a real COVID-19 shock scenario on the firm level. This model allows
us to study how the disruption dynamics in the real economy can lead to
interbank solvency contagion dynamics. We estimate to what extent this
amplifies financial systemic risk. We discuss the relative importance of these
contagion channels and find an increase of interbank contagion by 70% when
production network contagion is present. We then examine the financial systemic
risk firms bring to banks and find an increase of up to 28% in the presence of
the interbank contagion channel. This framework is the first financial systemic
risk model to take agent-level dynamics of the production network and shocks of
the real economy into account which opens a path for directly, and event-driven
understanding of the dynamical interaction between the real economy and
financial systems.",Jan Fialkowski; Christian Diem; András Borsos; Stefan Thurner,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17044v1,False,True,False,False,False,2762.0,Nuri Ersahin,Dallas,Active,,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5145774,"Systemic risk, Stress testing (software), Business, Financial risk, Supply chain, Finance, Economics, Financial system, Financial crisis, Computer science, Macroeconomics, Marketing, Programming language",,,
"Facilitating Battery Swapping Services for Freight Trucks with
  Spatial-Temporal Demand Prediction","Electrifying heavy-duty trucks offers a substantial opportunity to curtail
carbon emissions, advancing toward a carbon-neutral future. However, the
inherent challenges of limited battery energy and the sheer weight of
heavy-duty trucks lead to reduced mileage and prolonged charging durations.
Consequently, battery-swapping services emerge as an attractive solution for
these trucks. This paper employs a two-fold approach to investigate the
potential and enhance the efficacy of such services. Firstly, spatial-temporal
demand prediction models are adopted to predict the traffic patterns for the
upcoming hours. Subsequently, the prediction guides an optimization module for
efficient battery allocation and deployment. Analyzing the heavy-duty truck
data on a highway network spanning over 2,500 miles, our model and analysis
underscore the value of prediction/machine learning in facilitating future
decision-makings. In particular, we find that the initial phase of implementing
battery-swapping services favors mobile battery-swapping stations, but as the
system matures, fixed-location stations are preferred.",Linyu Liu; Zhen Dai; Shiji Song; Xiaocheng Li; Guanting Chen,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04440v2,False,True,False,False,False,2763.0,Cuicui Chen,Cornell,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2310.04440,"Truck, Battery (electricity), Heavy duty, Software deployment, Transport engineering, Computer science, Operations research, Automotive engineering, Engineering, Power (physics), Physics, Quantum mechanics, Operating system",,,
"Forecasting Automotive Supply Chain Shortfalls with Heterogeneous Time
  Series","Operational disruptions can significantly impact companies performance. Ford,
with its 37 plants globally, uses 17 billion parts annually to manufacture six
million cars and trucks. With up to ten tiers of suppliers between the company
and raw materials, any extended disruption in this supply chain can cause
substantial financial losses. Therefore, the ability to forecast and identify
such disruptions early is crucial for maintaining seamless operations. In this
study, we demonstrate how we construct a dataset consisting of many
multivariate time series to forecast first-tier supply chain disruptions,
utilizing features related to capacity, inventory, utilization, and processing,
as outlined in the classical Factory Physics framework. This dataset is
technically challenging due to its vast scale of over five hundred thousand
time series. Furthermore, these time series, while exhibiting certain
similarities, also display heterogeneity within specific subgroups. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel methodology that integrates an enhanced
Attention Sequence to Sequence Deep Learning architecture, using Neural Network
Embeddings to model group effects, with a Survival Analysis model. This model
is designed to learn intricate heterogeneous data patterns related to
operational disruptions. Our model has demonstrated a strong performance,
achieving 0.85 precision and 0.8 recall during the Quality Assurance (QA) phase
across Ford's five North American plants. Additionally, to address the common
criticism of Machine Learning models as black boxes, we show how the SHAP
framework can be used to generate feature importance from the model
predictions. It offers valuable insights that can lead to actionable strategies
and highlights the potential of advanced machine learning for managing and
mitigating supply chain risks in the automotive industry.",Bach Viet Do; Xingyu Li; Chaoye Pan; Oleg Gusikhin,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16739v2,False,True,False,False,False,2768.0,Tao Li,Florida,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2407.16739,"Automotive industry, Supply chain, Series (stratigraphy), Time series, Chain (unit), Business, Computer science, Operations research, Engineering, Marketing, Geology, Machine learning, Aerospace engineering, Paleontology, Physics, Astronomy",,,
"Same environment, stratified impacts? Air pollution, extreme
  temperatures, and birth weight in south China","This paper investigates whether associations between birth weight and
prenatal ambient environmental conditions--pollution and extreme
temperatures--differ by 1) maternal education; 2) children's innate health; and
3) interactions between these two. We link birth records from Guangzhou, China,
during a period of high pollution, to ambient air pollution (PM10 and a
composite measure) and extreme temperature data. We first use mean regressions
to test whether, overall, maternal education is an ""effect modifier"" in the
relationships between ambient air pollution, extreme temperature, and birth
weight. We then use conditional quantile regressions to test for effect
heterogeneity according to the unobserved innate vulnerability of babies after
conditioning on other confounders. Results show that 1) the negative
association between ambient exposures and birth weight is twice as large at
lower conditional quantiles of birth weights as at the median; 2) the
protection associated with college-educated mothers with respect to pollution
and extreme heat is heterogeneous and potentially substantial: between 0.02 and
0.34 standard deviations of birth weights, depending on the conditional
quantiles; 3) this protection is amplified under more extreme ambient

"Location inference on social media data for agile monitoring of public
  health crises: An application to opioid use and abuse during the Covid-19
  pandemic","The Covid-19 pandemic has intersected with the opioid epidemic to create a
unique public health crisis, with the health and economic consequences of the
virus and associated lockdowns compounding pre-existing social and economic
stressors associated with rising opioid and heroin use and abuse. In order to
better understand these interlocking crises, we use social media data to
extract qualitative and quantitative insights on the experiences of opioid
users during the Covid-19 pandemic. In particular, we use an unsupervised
learning approach to create a rich geolocated data source for public health
surveillance and analysis. To do this we first infer the location of 26,000
Reddit users that participate in opiate-related sub-communities (subreddits) by
combining named entity recognition, geocoding, density-based clustering, and
heuristic methods. Our strategy achieves 63 percent accuracy at state-level
location inference on a manually-annotated reference dataset. We then leverage
the geospatial nature of our user cohort to answer policy-relevant questions
about the impact of varying state-level policy approaches that balance economic
versus health concerns during Covid-19. We find that state government
strategies that prioritized economic reopening over curtailing the spread of
the virus created a markedly different environment and outcomes for opioid
users. Our results demonstrate that geospatial social media data can be used
for agile monitoring of complex public health crises.",Angela E.

"Where is Dmitry going? Framing 'migratory' decisions in the criminal
  underground","The cybercriminal underground consists of hundreds of forum communities that
function as marketplaces and information-exchange platforms for both
established and wannabe cybercriminals. The ecosystem is continuously evolving,
with users migrating between forums and platforms. The emergence of cybercrime
communities in Telegram and Discord only highlights the rising fragmentation
and adaptability of the ecosystem. In this position paper, we explore the
economic incentives and trust-building mechanisms that may drive a participant
(hereafter, Dmitry) of the cybercriminal underground ecosystem to migrate from
one forum or platform to another. What are the market signals that matter to
Dmitry's decision of joining a specific community, and what roles and purposes
do these communities or platforms play within the broader ecosystem?
Ultimately, we build towards our thesis that by studying these mechanisms we
could explain, and therefore act upon, Dmitry's choice of joining a criminal
community rather than another. To build this argument, we first discuss
previous work evaluating differences in trust signals depicted in criminal

When a `rat race' implies an intergenerational wealth trap,"Two critical questions about intergenerational outcomes are: one, whether
significant barriers or traps exist between different social or economic
strata; and two, the extent to which intergenerational outcomes do (or can be
used to) affect individual investment and consumption decisions. We develop a
model to explicitly relate these two questions, and prove the first such `rat
race' theorem, showing that a fundamental relationship exists between high
levels of individual investment and the existence of a wealth trap, which traps
otherwise identical agents at a lower level of wealth. Our simple model of
intergenerational wealth dynamics involves agents which balance current
consumption with investment in a single descendant. Investments then determine
descendant wealth via a potentially nonlinear and discontinuous competitiveness
function about which we do not make concavity assumptions. From this model we
demonstrate how to infer such a competitiveness function from investments,
along with geometric criteria to determine individual decisions. Additionally
we investigate the stability of a wealth distribution, both to local
perturbations and to the introduction of new agents with no wealth.",Joel Nishimura,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01019v1,False,True,False,False,False,2797.0,Jeremy A Kirk,Wisconsin,Active,,,"Descendant, Consumption (sociology), Investment (military), Economics, Race (biology), Microeconomics, Function (biology), Distribution (mathematics), Stability (learning theory), Trap (plumbing), Balance (ability), Wealth distribution, Inequality, Mathematics, Computer science, Sociology, Political science, Geography, Politics, Social science, Law, Gender studies, Mathematical analysis, Biology, Evolutionary biology, Machine learning, Medicine, Physics, Astronomy, Meteorology, Physical medicine and rehabilitation",,,
"Two Burning Questions on COVID-19: Did shutting down the economy help?
  Can we (partially) reopen the economy without risking the second wave?","As we reach the apex of the COVID-19 pandemic, the most pressing question
facing us is: can we even partially reopen the economy without risking a second
wave? We first need to understand if shutting down the economy helped. And if
it did, is it possible to achieve similar gains in the war against the pandemic
while partially opening up the economy? To do so, it is critical to understand
the effects of the various interventions that can be put into place and their
corresponding health and economic implications. Since many interventions exist,
the key challenge facing policy makers is understanding the potential
trade-offs between them, and choosing the particular set of interventions that
works best for their circumstance. In this memo, we provide an overview of
Synthetic Interventions (a natural generalization of Synthetic Control), a
data-driven and statistically principled method to perform what-if scenario
planning, i.e., for policy makers to understand the trade-offs between
different interventions before having to actually enact them. In essence, the
method leverages information from different interventions that have already
been enacted across the world and fits it to a policy maker's setting of
interest, e.g., to estimate the effect of mobility-restricting interventions on
the U.S., we use daily death data from countries that enforced severe mobility
restrictions to create a ""synthetic low mobility U.S."" and predict the
counterfactual trajectory of the U.S. if it had indeed applied a similar
intervention. Using Synthetic Interventions, we find that lifting severe
mobility restrictions and only retaining moderate mobility restrictions (at
retail and transit locations), seems to effectively flatten the curve. We hope
this provides guidance on weighing the trade-offs between the safety of the
population, strain on the healthcare system, and impact on the economy.",Anish Agarwal; Abdullah Alomar; Arnab Sarker; Devavrat Shah; Dennis Shen; Cindy Yang,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00072v2,False,True,False,False,False,2801.0,Timothy Dore,Fed Board,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2005.00072,"Psychological intervention, Counterfactual thinking, Intervention (counseling), Set (abstract data type), Pandemic, Economics, Economy, Business, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Computer science, Psychology, Medicine, Social psychology, Psychiatry, Programming language, Disease, Pathology, Infectious disease (medical specialty)",,,

"On spectral algorithms for community detection in stochastic blockmodel
  graphs with vertex covariates","In network inference applications, it is often desirable to detect community
structure, namely to cluster vertices into groups, or blocks, according to some
measure of similarity. Beyond mere adjacency matrices, many real networks also
involve vertex covariates that carry key information about underlying block
structure in graphs. To assess the effects of such covariates on block
recovery, we present a comparative analysis of two model-based spectral
algorithms for clustering vertices in stochastic blockmodel graphs with vertex
covariates. The first algorithm uses only the adjacency matrix, and directly
estimates the block assignments. The second algorithm incorporates both the
adjacency matrix and the vertex covariates into the estimation of block
assignments, and moreover quantifies the explicit impact of the vertex
covariates on the resulting estimate of the block assignments. We employ
Chernoff information to analytically compare the algorithms' performance and
derive the information-theoretic Chernoff ratio for certain models of interest.
Analytic results and simulations suggest that the second algorithm is often
preferred: we can often better estimate the induced block assignments by first
estimating the effect of vertex covariates. In addition, real data examples
also indicate that the second algorithm has the advantages of revealing
underlying block structure and taking observed vertex heterogeneity into
account in real applications. Our findings emphasize the importance of
distinguishing between observed and unobserved factors that can affect block
structure in graphs.",Cong Mu; Angelo Mele; Lingxin Hao; Joshua Cape; Avanti Athreya; Carey E.

Delay Analysis of Hybrid WiFi-LiFi System,"Heterogeneous wireless networks are capable of effectively leveraging
different access technologies to provide a wide variety of coverage areas. In
this paper, the coexistence of WiFi and visible light communication (VLC) is

non-aggregated system, any request is either allocated to WiFi or VLC. While in
the second configuration, the aggregated system, each request is split into two
pieces, one is forwarded to WiFi and the other is forwarded to VLC. Under the
assumptions of Poisson arrival process of requests and the exponential
distribution of requests size, it is mathematically proved that the aggregated
system provides lower minimum average system delay than that of the
non-aggregated system. For the non-aggregated system, the optimal traffic
allocation ratio is derived. For the aggregated system, an efficient solution

when provided information about actual wages. Second, using causal mediation
analysis, we test whether the consideration of a rich set of personal and
professional controls, namely concerning family formation and children in
addition to professional preferences, accounts for the difference in wage
expectations across genders. We find that males and females overestimate their
wages compared to actual ones, and that males respond in an overconfident

An Agent-Based Model for Poverty and Discrimination Policy-Making,"The deceleration of global poverty reduction in the last decades suggests
that traditional redistribution policies are losing their effectiveness.
Alternative ways to work towards the #1 United Nations Sustainable Development
Goal (poverty eradication) are required. NGOs have insistingly denounced the
criminalization of poverty, and the social science literature suggests that
discrimination against the poor (a phenomenon known as aporophobia) could
constitute a brake to the fight against poverty. This paper describes a
proposal for an agent-based model to examine the impact that aporophobia at the
institutional level has on poverty levels. This aporophobia agent-based model
(AABM) will first be applied to a case study in the city of Barcelona. The
regulatory environment is central to the model, since aporophobia has been
identified in the legal framework. The AABM presented in this paper constitutes
a cornerstone to obtain empirical evidence, in a non-invasive way, on the
causal relationship between aporophobia and poverty levels. The simulations
that will be generated based on the AABM have the potential to inform a new

From signaling to interviews in random matching markets,"In many two-sided labor markets, interviews are conducted before matches are
formed. An increase in the number of interviews in the market for medical
residencies raised the demand for signaling mechanisms, in which applicants can
send a limited number of signals to communicate interest. We study the role of
signaling mechanisms in reducing the number of interviews in centralized random
matching markets with post-interview shocks. For the market to clear we focus
on interim stability, which extends the notion of stability to ensure that
agents do not regret not interviewing with each other. A matching is almost
interim stable if it is interim stable after removing a vanishingly small
fraction of agents.
  We first study signaling mechanisms in random matching markets when agents on
the short side, long side, or both sides signal their top~$d$ preferred
partners. Interviews graphs are formed by including all pairs where at least
one party has signaled the other. We show that when $d = \omega(1)$, short-side
signaling leads to almost interim stable matchings. Long-side signaling is only
effective when the market is almost balanced. Conversely, when the interview
shocks are negligible and $d = o(\log n)$, both-side signaling fails to achieve
almost interim stability. For larger $d \ge \Omega(\log^2 n)$, short-side
signaling achieves perfect interim stability, while long-side signaling fails
in imbalanced markets. We build on our findings to propose a signaling
mechanism for multi-tiered random markets. Our analysis identifies conditions
under which signaling mechanisms are incentive compatible. A technical
contribution is the analysis of a message-passing algorithm that efficiently
determines interim stability and matching outcomes by leveraging local
neighborhood structures.",Maxwell Allman; Itai Ashlagi; Amin Saberi; Sophie H.

"Supply Chain Digital Twin Framework Design: An Approach of Supply Chain
  Operations Reference Model and System of Systems","Digital twin technology has been regarded as a beneficial approach in supply
chain development. Different from traditional digital twin (temporal dynamic),
supply chain digital twin is a spatio-temporal dynamic system. This paper
explains what is 'twined' in supply chain digital twin and how to 'twin' them
to handle the spatio-temporal dynamic issue. A supply chain digital twin
framework is developed based on the theories of system of systems and supply
chain operations reference model. This framework is universal and can be
applied in various types of supply chain systems. We firstly decompose the
supply chain system into unified standard blocks preparing for the adoption of
digital twin. Next, the idea of supply chain operations reference model is
adopted to digitise basic supply chain activities within each block and explain
how to use existing information system. Then, individual sub-digital twin is
established for each member in supply chain system. After that, we apply the
concept of system of systems to integrate and coordinate sub-digital twin into
supply chain digital twin from the views of supply chain business integration
and information system integration. At last, one simple supply chain system is
applied to illustrate the application of the proposed model.",Jie Zhang; Alexandra Brintrup; Anisoara Calinescu; Edward Kosasih; Angira Sharma,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09485v1,False,True,False,False,False,2878.0,Bin Wei,Atlanta,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2107.09485,"Supply chain, Chain (unit), Computer science, Business, Marketing, Physics, Astronomy",,,
"Flipping the Script on Criminal Justice Risk Assessment: An actuarial
  model for assessing the risk the federal sentencing system poses to
  defendants","In the criminal justice system, algorithmic risk assessment instruments are
used to predict the risk a defendant poses to society; examples include the
risk of recidivating or the risk of failing to appear at future court dates.
However, defendants are also at risk of harm from the criminal justice system.
To date, there exists no risk assessment instrument that considers the risk the
system poses to the individual. We develop a risk assessment instrument that
""flips the script."" Using data about U.S. federal sentencing decisions, we
build a risk assessment instrument that predicts the likelihood an individual
will receive an especially lengthy sentence given factors that should be
legally irrelevant to the sentencing decision. To do this, we develop a
two-stage modeling approach. Our first-stage model is used to determine which
sentences were ""especially lengthy."" We then use a second-stage model to
predict the defendant's risk of receiving a sentence that is flagged as
especially lengthy given factors that should be legally irrelevant. The factors
that should be legally irrelevant include, for example, race, court location,
and other socio-demographic information about the defendant. Our instrument
achieves comparable predictive accuracy to risk assessment instruments used in
pretrial and parole contexts. We discuss the limitations of our modeling
approach and use the opportunity to highlight how traditional risk assessment
instruments in various criminal justice settings also suffer from many of the
same limitations and embedded value systems of their creators.",Mikaela Meyer; Aaron Horowitz; Erica Marshall; Kristian Lum,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13505v2,False,True,False,False,False,2882.0,William J von Geldern,Seattle,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1145/3531146.3533104,"Criminal justice, Risk assessment, Harm, Actuarial science, Sentence, Risk management tools, Psychology, Economic Justice, Risk analysis (engineering), Risk management, Criminology, Computer science, Law, Computer security, Political science, Business, Social psychology, Artificial intelligence, Finance",American Civil Liberties Union; Carnegie Mellon University; University of Pennsylvania,"Idaho Justice Project, USA; Department of Statistics &amp; Data Science and Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University, USA; Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania, USA; American Civil Liberties Union, USA","Idaho Justice Project, USA; Department of Statistics &amp; Data Science and Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University, USA; Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania, USA; American Civil Liberties Union, USA"
"A Comprehensive Survey of Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Talent

critical time for organizations to rethink how to make talent-related decisions
in a quantitative manner. Indeed, the recent development of Big Data and
Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have revolutionized human resource
management. The availability of large-scale talent and management-related data
provides unparalleled opportunities for business leaders to comprehend
organizational behaviors and gain tangible knowledge from a data science
perspective, which in turn delivers intelligence for real-time decision-making
and effective talent management at work for their organizations. In the last
decade, talent analytics has emerged as a promising field in applied data
science for human resource management, garnering significant attention from AI
communities and inspiring numerous research efforts. To this end, we present an
up-to-date and comprehensive survey on AI technologies used for talent
analytics in the field of human resource management. Specifically, we first
provide the background knowledge of talent analytics and categorize various
pertinent data. Subsequently, we offer a comprehensive taxonomy of relevant

"Credit risk and companies' inter-organizational networks: Assessing
  impact of suppliers and buyers on CDS spreads","Companies do not operate in a vacuum. As companies move towards an
increasingly specialized production function and their reach is becoming truly
global, their aptitude in managing and shaping their inter-organizational
network is a determining factor in measuring their health. Current models of
company financial health often lack variables explaining the
inter-organizational network, and as such, assume that (1) all networks are the
same and (2) the performance of partners do not impact companies. This paper
aims to be a first step in the direction of removing these assumptions.
Specifically, the impact is illustrated by examining the effects of customer
and supplier concentrations and partners' credit risk on credit-default swap
(CDS) spreads while controlling for credit risk and size. We rely upon
supply-chain data from Bloomberg that provides insight into companies'
relationships. The empirical results show that a well diversified customer
network lowers CDS spread, while having stable partners with low default
probabilities increase spreads. The latter result suggests that successful
companies do not focus on building a stable eco-system around themselves, but
instead focus on their own profit maximization at the cost of the financial
health of their suppliers' and customers'. At a more general level, the results
indicate the importance of considering the inter-organizational networks, and
highlight the value of including network variables in credit risk models.",Tore Opsahl; William Newton,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06585v1,False,True,False,False,False,2891.0,Judson Caskey,UCLA,Active,,,"Business, Profit maximization, Supply chain, Credit risk, Industrial organization, Credit default swap, Function (biology), Profit (economics), Marketing, Finance, Microeconomics, Economics, Evolutionary biology, Biology",,,

"Bayesian Safe Policy Learning with Chance Constrained Optimization:
  Application to Military Security Assessment during the Vietnam War","Algorithmic decisions and recommendations are used in many high-stakes
decision-making settings such as criminal justice, medicine, and public policy.
We investigate whether it would have been possible to improve a security
assessment algorithm employed during the Vietnam War, using outcomes measured
immediately after its introduction in late 1969. This empirical application
raises several methodological challenges that frequently arise in high-stakes
algorithmic decision-making. First, before implementing a new algorithm, it is
essential to characterize and control the risk of yielding worse outcomes than
the existing algorithm. Second, the existing algorithm is deterministic, and
learning a new algorithm requires transparent extrapolation. Third, the
existing algorithm involves discrete decision tables that are difficult to
optimize over.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Average Conditional Risk
(ACRisk), which first quantifies the risk that a new algorithmic policy leads
to worse outcomes for subgroups of individual units and then averages this over
the distribution of subgroups. We also propose a Bayesian policy learning
framework that maximizes the posterior expected value while controlling the
posterior expected ACRisk. This framework separates the estimation of
heterogeneous treatment effects from policy optimization, enabling flexible
estimation of effects and optimization over complex policy classes. We
characterize the resulting chance-constrained optimization problem as a
constrained linear programming problem. Our analysis shows that compared to the
actual algorithm used during the Vietnam War, the learned algorithm assesses
most regions as more secure and emphasizes economic and political factors over
military factors.",Zeyang Jia; Eli Ben-Michael; Kosuke Imai,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08840v2,False,True,False,False,False,2896.0,Melissa Desfor,Philadelphia,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2307.08840,"Computer science, Bayesian probability, Machine learning, Artificial intelligence, Mathematical optimization, Mathematics",,,
"Quantifying Global Food Trade: A Net Caloric Content Approach to Food
  Trade Network Analysis","As the global population and the per capita demand for resource intensive
diets continues to grow, the corresponding increase in food demand challenges
the global food system, enhancing its reliance on trade. Most previous research
typically constructed either unweighted networks or weighted solely by tonnage
to represent food trade, and focused on bilateral trade relationships between
pairs of countries. This study investigates the properties of global food trade
constructed in terms of total food calories associated with all the main food
products exchanged along each trade link (edge of the food trade network).
Utilizing data from the Food and Agriculture Organization between 1986 and
2022, we construct a directed, weighted network of net caloric flows between
countries. This approach highlights the importance of considering nutritional
value in discussions of food security and trade policies, offering a more
holistic view of global food trade dynamics. Our analysis reveals significant
heterogeneity in trade patterns, with certain countries emerging as major
exporters or importers of food calories. Moreover, we employ network measures,
including network connectivity, network heterogeneity, network modularity, and
node correlation similarity, to elucidate the structural dynamics of global net
food calorie trade networks that are relevant to the stability and resilience
of the global food system. Our work provides a more nuanced understanding of
global food trade dynamics, emphasizing the need for comprehensive strategies
to enhance the resilience and sustainability of food trade networks.",Xiaopeng Wang; Chengyi Tu; Shuhao Chen; Sicheng Wang; Ying Fan; Samir Suweis; Paolo D'Odorico,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18856v2,False,True,False,False,False,2897.0,Patrick Brady,Minnesota,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(18)31788-4,"Anthropocene, Food systems, Population, Environmental health, Medicine, Sustainability, Global health, Food security, Public health, Biology, Ecology, Agriculture, Nursing","International Food Policy Research Institute;

"Who Followed the Blueprint? Analyzing the Responses of U.S. Federal
  Agencies to the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights","This study examines the extent to which U.S. federal agencies responded to
and implemented the principles outlined in the White House's October 2022
""Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights."" The Blueprint provided a framework for
the ethical governance of artificial intelligence systems, organized around
five core principles: safety and effectiveness, protection against algorithmic
discrimination, data privacy, notice and explanation about AI systems, and
human alternatives and fallback.
  Through an analysis of publicly available records across 15 federal
departments, the authors found limited evidence that the Blueprint directly
influenced agency actions after its release. Only five departments explicitly
mentioned the Blueprint, while 12 took steps aligned with one or more of its
principles. However, much of this work appeared to have precedents predating
the Blueprint or motivations disconnected from it, such as compliance with
prior executive orders on trustworthy AI. Departments' activities often
emphasized priorities like safety, accountability and transparency that
overlapped with Blueprint principles, but did not necessarily stem from it.
  The authors conclude that the non-binding Blueprint seems to have had minimal
impact on shaping the U.S. government's approach to ethical AI governance in
its first year. Factors like public concerns after high-profile AI releases and
obligations to follow direct executive orders likely carried more influence
over federal agencies. More rigorous study would be needed to definitively
assess the Blueprint's effects within the federal bureaucracy and broader
society.",Darren Lage; Riley Pruitt; Jason Ross Arnold,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19076v1,False,True,False,False,False,2907.0,Regina Werum,Nebraska,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2404.19076,"Blueprint, Political science, Public administration, Law and economics, Law, Business, Management, Engineering, Economics, Mechanical engineering",,,
"Using massive health insurance claims data to predict very high-cost
  claimants: a machine learning approach","Due to escalating healthcare costs, accurately predicting which patients will
incur high costs is an important task for payers and providers of healthcare.
High-cost claimants (HiCCs) are patients who have annual costs above
$\$250,000$ and who represent just 0.16% of the insured population but
currently account for 9% of all healthcare costs. In this study, we aimed to
develop a high-performance algorithm to predict HiCCs to inform a novel care
management system. Using health insurance claims from 48 million people and
augmented with census data, we applied machine learning to train binary
classification models to calculate the personal risk of HiCC. To train the
models, we developed a platform starting with 6,006 variables across all
clinical and demographic dimensions and constructed over one hundred candidate
models. The best model achieved an area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve of 91.2%. The model exceeds the highest published
performance (84%) and remains high for patients with no prior history of
high-cost status (89%), who have less than a full year of enrollment (87%), or
lack pharmacy claims data (88%). It attains an area under the precision-recall
curve of 23.1%, and precision of 74% at a threshold of 0.99. A care management
program enrolling 500 people with the highest HiCC risk is expected to treat
199 true HiCCs and generate a net savings of $\$7.3$ million per year. Our
results demonstrate that high-performing predictive models can be constructed
using claims data and publicly available data alone, even for rare high-cost
claimants exceeding $\$250,000$. Our model demonstrates the transformational
power of machine learning and artificial intelligence in care management, which
would allow healthcare payers and providers to introduce the next generation of
care management programs.",José M.

"Where to Build Food Banks and Pantries: A Two-Level Machine Learning
  Approach","Over 44 million Americans currently suffer from food insecurity, of whom 13
million are children. Across the United States, thousands of food banks and

insecure families. By optimizing food bank and pantry locations, food would
become more accessible to families who desperately require it. In this work, we
introduce a novel two-level optimization framework, which utilizes the
K-Medoids clustering algorithm in conjunction with the Open-Source Routing
Machine engine, to optimize food bank and pantry locations based on real road
distances to houses and house blocks. Our proposed framework also has the
adaptability to factor in considerations such as median household income using
a pseudo-weighted K-Medoids algorithm. Testing conducted with California and
Indiana household data, as well as comparisons with real food bank and pantry
locations showed that interestingly, our proposed framework yields food pantry
locations superior to those of real existing ones and saves significant
distance for households, while there is a marginal penalty on the first level

Using Deep Learning to Find the Next Unicorn: A Practical Synthesis,"Startups often represent newly established business models associated with
disruptive innovation and high scalability. They are commonly regarded as
powerful engines for economic and social development. Meanwhile, startups are
heavily constrained by many factors such as limited financial funding and human
resources. Therefore, the chance for a startup to eventually succeed is as rare
as ""spotting a unicorn in the wild"". Venture Capital (VC) strives to identify
and invest in unicorn startups during their early stages, hoping to gain a high
return. To avoid entirely relying on human domain expertise and intuition,
investors usually employ data-driven approaches to forecast the success
probability of startups. Over the past two decades, the industry has gone
through a paradigm shift moving from conventional statistical approaches
towards becoming machine-learning (ML) based. Notably, the rapid growth of data
volume and variety is quickly ushering in deep learning (DL), a subset of ML,
as a potentially superior approach in terms of capacity and expressivity. In
this work, we carry out a literature review and synthesis on DL-based
approaches, covering the entire DL life cycle. The objective is a) to obtain a

"Bridging the Generational Gap: Exploring How Virtual Reality Supports
  Remote Communication Between Grandparents and Grandchildren","When living apart, grandparents and grandchildren often use audio-visual
communication approaches to stay connected. However, these approaches seldom
provide sufficient companionship and intimacy due to a lack of co-presence and
spatial interaction, which can be fulfilled by immersive virtual reality (VR).
To understand how grandparents and grandchildren might leverage VR to
facilitate their remote communication and better inform future design, we
conducted a user-centered participatory design study with twelve pairs of
grandparents and grandchildren. Results show that VR affords casual and equal
communication by reducing the generational gap, and promotes conversation by
offering shared activities as bridges for connection. Participants preferred
resemblant appearances on avatars for conveying well-being but created ideal

"Introductory physics students' recognition of strong peers: Gender and
  racial/ethnic bias differ by course level and context","Researchers have pinpointed recognition from others as one of the most
important dimensions of students' science and engineering identity. Studies,
however, have found gender biases in students' recognition of their peers, with
inconsistent patterns across introductory science and engineering courses.
Toward finding the source of this variation, we examine whether a gender bias
exists in students' nominations of strong peers across three different remote,
introductory physics courses with varying student populations (varying
demographics, majors, and course levels). We also uniquely evaluate possible
racial/ethnic biases and probe the relationship between instructional context
(whether lecture or laboratory) and recognition. Some of our results replicate
previous findings (such as the the association of course grade and small class
section enrollment with nominations), while others offer contradictions.
Comparing across our three courses and the prior work, results suggest that
course level (whether first-year students or beyond-first-year students) might
be more associated with a gender bias in peer recognition than other variables.
Surprisingly, we also find instances of racial/ethnic biases in favor of
students from backgrounds historically underrepresented in science. Finally, we
find that the nomination patterns differ when students nominate individuals
strong in the lecture material versus laboratory material. This work serves as
an important step in determining which courses and contexts exhibit biases in
peer recognition, as well as how students' perceptions of one another form in
remote teaching environments.",Meagan Sundstrom; Ashley B. Heim; Barum Park; N. G.

Achieving an Efficient and Fair Equilibrium Through Taxation,"It is well known that a game equilibrium can be far from efficient or fair,
due to the misalignment between individual and social objectives. The focus of
this paper is to design a new mechanism framework that induces an efficient and
fair equilibrium in a general class of games. To achieve this goal, we propose
a taxation framework, which first imposes a tax on each player based on the
perceived payoff (income), and then redistributes the collected tax to other
players properly. By turning the tax rate, this framework spans the continuum
space between strategic interactions (of selfish players) and altruistic
interactions (of unselfish players), hence provides rich modeling
possibilities. The key challenge in the design of this framework is the proper
taxing rule (i.e., the tax exemption and tax rate) that induces the desired
equilibrium in a wide range of games. First, we propose a flat tax rate (i.e.,
a single tax rate for all players), which is necessary and sufficient for
achieving an efficient equilibrium in any static strategic game with common
knowledge. Then, we provide several tax exemption rules that achieve some
typical fairness criterions (such as the Max-min fairness) at the equilibrium.
We further illustrate the implementation of the framework in the game of
Prisoners' Dilemma.",Lin Gao; Jianwei Huang,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03200v1,False,True,False,False,False,2956.0,William Hoyt,Kentucky,Active,,https://doi.org/10.23919/apcc.2017.8304072,"Equilibrium selection, Microeconomics, Computer science, Stochastic game, Mathematical economics, Nash equilibrium, Economics, Game theory, Repeated game",Harbin Institute of Technology; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen; Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong","School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen; Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"
"Measuring the Impact of Taxes and Public Services on Property Values: A
  Double Machine Learning Approach","How do property prices respond to changes in local taxes and local public
services? Attempts to measure this, starting with Oates (1969), have suffered
from a lack of local public service controls. Recent work attempts to overcome
such data limitations through the use of quasi-experimental methods. We revisit
this fundamental problem, but adopt a different empirical strategy that pairs
the double machine learning estimator of Chernozhukov et al. (2018) with a
novel dataset of 947 time-varying local characteristic and public service
controls for all municipalities in Sweden over the 2010-2016 period. We find
that properly controlling for local public service and characteristic controls
more than doubles the estimated impact of local income taxes on house prices.
We also exploit the unique features of our dataset to demonstrate that tax
capitalization is stronger in areas with greater municipal competition,
providing support for a core implication of the Tiebout hypothesis. Finally, we
measure the impact of public services, education, and crime on house prices and
the effect of local taxes on migration.",Isaiah Hull; Anna Grodecka-Messi,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14751v1,False,True,False,False,False,2956.0,William Hoyt,Kentucky,Active,,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2203.14751,"Tiebout model, Capitalization, Exploit, Measure (data warehouse), Work (physics), Competition (biology), Service (business), Economics, Property tax, Core (optical fiber), Public economics, Public service, Estimator, Econometrics, Business, Public good, Microeconomics, Computer science, Economy, Political science, Tax reform, Philosophy, Computer security, Mathematics, Database, Ecology, Linguistics, Engineering, Biology, Telecommunications, Mechanical engineering, Statistics, Law",,,
"Association Between Neighborhood Factors and Adult Obesity in Shelby
  County, Tennessee: Geospatial Machine Learning Approach","Obesity is a global epidemic causing at least 2.8 million deaths per year.
This complex disease is associated with significant socioeconomic burden,
reduced work productivity, unemployment, and other social determinants of
Health (SDoH) disparities. Objective: The objective of this study was to
investigate the effects of SDoH on obesity prevalence among adults in Shelby
County, Tennessee, USA using a geospatial machine-learning approach. Obesity
prevalence was obtained from publicly available CDC 500 cities database while
SDoH indicators were extracted from the U.S. Census and USDA. We examined the
geographic distributions of obesity prevalence patterns using Getis-Ord Gi*
statistics and calibrated multiple models to study the association between SDoH
and adult obesity. Also, unsupervised machine learning was used to conduct
grouping analysis to investigate the distribution of obesity prevalence and
associated SDoH indicators. Results depicted a high percentage of neighborhoods
experiencing high adult obesity prevalence within Shelby County. In the census
tract, median household income, as well as the percentage of individuals who
were black, home renters, living below the poverty level, fifty-five years or
older, unmarried, and uninsured, had a significant association with adult
obesity prevalence. The grouping analysis revealed disparities in obesity
prevalence amongst disadvantaged neighborhoods. More research is needed that
examines linkages between geographical location, SDoH, and chronic diseases.
These findings, which depict a significantly higher prevalence of obesity
within disadvantaged neighborhoods, and other geospatial information can be
leveraged to offer valuable insights informing health decision-making and
interventions that mitigate risk factors for increasing obesity prevalence.",Whitney S Brakefield; Olufunto A Olusanya; Arash Shaban-Nejad,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05335v1,False,True,False,False,False,2970.0,Latetia V Moore Freeman,Atlanta,Active,,https://doi.org/10.2196/37039,"Obesity, Socioeconomic status, Disadvantaged, Geospatial analysis, Poverty, Public health, Environmental health, Geography, Social determinants of health, Health equity, Demography, Gerontology, Medicine, Population, Political science, Sociology, Cartography, Nursing, Internal medicine, Law",University of Tennessee Health Science Center; University of Tennessee at Knoxville,"Center for Biomedical Informatics, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, United States; Bredesen Center for Data Science and Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, United States","Center for Biomedical Informatics, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, United States; Bredesen Center for Data Science and Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, United States"
"Semi-Parametric Empirical Best Prediction for small area estimation of
  unemployment indicators","The Italian National Institute for Statistics regularly provides estimates of
unemployment indicators using data from the Labor Force Survey. However, direct
estimates of unemployment incidence cannot be released for Local Labor Market
Areas. These are unplanned domains defined as clusters of municipalities; many
are out-of-sample areas and the majority is characterized by a small sample
size, which render direct estimates inadequate. The Empirical Best Predictor
represents an appropriate, model-based, alternative. However, for non-Gaussian
responses, its computation and the computation of the analytic approximation to
its Mean Squared Error require the solution of (possibly) multiple integrals
that, generally, have not a closed form. To solve the issue, Monte Carlo
methods and parametric bootstrap are common choices, even though the
computational burden is a non trivial task. In this paper, we propose a
Semi-Parametric Empirical Best Predictor for a (possibly) non-linear mixed
effect model by leaving the distribution of the area-specific random effects
unspecified and estimating it from the observed data. This approach is known to
lead to a discrete mixing distribution which helps avoid unverifiable
parametric assumptions and heavy integral approximations. We also derive a
second-order, bias-corrected, analytic approximation to the corresponding Mean
Squared Error. Finite sample properties of the proposed approach are tested via
a large scale simulation study. Furthermore, the proposal is applied to
unit-level data from the 2012 Italian Labor Force Survey to estimate
unemployment incidence for 611 Local Labor Market Areas using auxiliary
information from administrative registers and the 2011 Census.",Maria Francesca Marino; Maria Giovanna Ranalli; Nicola Salvati; Marco Alfo',arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02220v2,False,True,False,False,False,2985.0,Maria Zhu,Cornell,Active,,,"Small area estimation, Parametric statistics, Econometrics, Sample size determination, Unemployment, Gaussian, Statistics, Mean squared error, Monte Carlo method, Sample (material), Computation, Mathematics, Estimator, Economics, Algorithm, Physics, Chemistry, Chromatography, Quantum mechanics, Economic growth",,,

"Creating an institutional ecosystem for cash transfer programming:
  Lessons from post-disaster governance in Indonesia","Humanitarian and disaster management actors have increasingly adopted cash
transfer to reduce the sufferings and vulnerability of the survivors. Case
transfers have also been used as a critical instrument in the current COVID-19
pandemic. Unfortunately, academic work on humanitarian and disaster-cash
transfer related issues remains limited. This article explores how NGOs and
governments implement humanitarian cash transfer in a post-disaster setting
using an exploratory research strategy. It asks What are institutional
constraints and opportunities faced by humanitarian emergency responders in
ensuring an effective humanitarian cash transfer and how humanitarian actors
address such institutional conditions. We introduced a new conceptual
framework, namely humanitarian and disaster management ecosystem for cash
transfer. This framework allows non-governmental actors to restore complex
relations between the state, disaster survivors or citizen, local market
economy and civil society. Mixed methods and multistage research strategy were
used to collect and analyze primary and secondary data. The findings suggest
that implementing cash transfers in the context of post tsunamigenic
earthquakes and liquefaction hazards, NGOs must co-create an ecosystem of
response that not only aimed at restoring peoples access to cash and basic
needs but first they must restore relations between the states and their
citizen while linking the at-risk communities with the private sectors to
jump-starting local livelihoods and market economy.",Jonatan A.

The Policy Paradox: Government Debt Servicing and Local Bank Risk Growth,"The issue of local government debt is widely recognized as one of the ""gray
rhinos"" affecting the stable development of China's economy. Government debt
can transmit risks to local banks, which are among the primary holders of local
debt, thereby triggering systemic financial risks. Consequently, exploring debt
resolution pathways and evaluating the systematic effects of debt servicing
policies has become critically important. This study employs panel data from
348 local commercial banks across 29 provincial-level administrative regions in
China from 2010 to 2023, and constructs a difference-in-differences (DID) model
to investigate the impact of the State Council's special supervision of debt
servicing on local bank risks. The findings indicate that the government's debt
servicing policy essentially represents a shift of government debt from
explicit to implicit forms, significantly increasing the risks faced by local
banks and producing outcomes contrary to the policy's original intent. This
effect is particularly pronounced for rural commercial banks and banks with
high customer concentration and fewer branches. Mechanism analysis reveals two
key insights. First, local banks are heavily influenced by local government
control; the government's debt servicing requires banks to support the
government by purchasing government bonds and other financial instruments,
which leads to a deterioration in asset quality and an expansion of risk
exposure. Second, government debt crowds out private credit from local banks,
weakening the region's repayment capacity and ultimately increasing bank risk.
Our research uncovers the counterintuitive effects of government debt servicing
and offers corresponding policy recommendations.",Yan Li,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13423v1,False,True,False,False,False,3020.0,Vyacheslav Mikhed,Philadelphia,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-4978,"Corporate governance, Aggregate (composite), Business, Political science, Finance, Composite material, Materials science",Brown University; World Bank Group; World Bank,"Institution Aart Kraay and Massimo Mastruzzi, The World Bank; Brown University Center for Public Policy Description University located in Providence, United States; The World Bank Development Research Group Macroeconomics and Growth Team","Institution Aart Kraay and Massimo Mastruzzi, The World Bank; Brown University Center for Public Policy Description University located in Providence, United States; The World Bank Development Research Group Macroeconomics and Growth Team"
"Aligning Technical Debt Prioritization with Business Objectives: A
  Multiple-Case Study","Technical debt (TD) is a metaphor to describe the trade-off between
short-term workarounds and long-term goals in software development. Despite
being widely used to explain technical issues in business terms, industry and
academia still lack a proper way to manage technical debt while explicitly
considering business priorities. In this paper, we report on a multiple-case
study of how two big software development companies handle technical debt
items, and we show how taking the business perspective into account can improve
the decision making for the prioritization of technical debt. We also propose a
first step toward an approach that uses business process management (BPM) to
manage technical debt. We interviewed a set of IT business stakeholders, and we
collected and analyzed different sets of technical debt items, comparing how
these items would be prioritized using a purely technical versus a
business-oriented approach. We found that the use of business process
management to support technical debt management makes the technical debt
prioritization decision process more aligned with business expectations. We
also found evidence that the business process management approach can help
technical debt management achieve business objectives.",Rodrigo Rebouças de Almeida; Uirá Kulesza; Christoph Treude; D'angellys Cavalcanti Feitosa; Aliandro Higino Guedes Lima,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05582v1,False,True,False,False,False,3020.0,Vyacheslav Mikhed,Philadelphia,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1109/icsme.2018.00075,"Technical debt, Business rule, Computer science, Debt, Process management, Business requirements, Business analysis, Business, Business process, Risk analysis (engineering), Software development, Finance, Software, Business model, Marketing, Work in process, Programming language",The University of Adelaide; Universidade Federal da Paraíba; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte,"University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia; PPgSc, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte - UFRN, Natal, Brazil; Conductor, São Paulo, Brazil; Federal University of Paraiba - UFPB, Rio Tinto, Brazil; Dataprev, Brasilia, Brazil","University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia; PPgSc, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte - UFRN, Natal, Brazil; Conductor, São Paulo, Brazil; Federal University of Paraiba - UFPB, Rio Tinto, Brazil; Dataprev, Brasilia, Brazil"

Strain Relaxation via Phase Transformation in SrSnO3,"SrSnO3 (SSO) is an emerging ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductor with
potential for highpower applications. In-plane compressive strain was recently
shown to stabilize the high temperature tetragonal phase of SSO at room
temperature (RT) which exists at T > 1062 K in bulk. Here, we report on the
study of strain relaxation in epitaxial, tetragonal phase of Nd-doped SSO films
grown on GdScO3 (110) (GSO) substrates using radical-based hybrid molecular
beam epitaxy. The thinnest SSO film (thickness, t = 12 nm) yielded a fully
coherent tetragonal phase at RT. At 12 nm < t < 110 nm, the tetragonal phase
first transformed into orthorhombic phase and then at t > 110 nm, the
orthorhombic phase began to relax by forming misfit dislocations. Remarkably,
the tetragonal phase remained fully coherent until it completely transformed
into the orthorhombic phase. Using thickness- and temperature-dependent
electronic transport measurements, we discuss the important roles of the
surface, phase coexistence, and misfit dislocations on carrier density and
mobility in Nd-doped SSO. This study provides unprecedented insights into the
strain relaxation behavior and its consequences for electronic transport in

"Coupling Coordinated Development among Digital Economy, Regional
  Innovation and Talent Employment A case study of Hangzhou Metropolitan
  Circle, China","Coordination development across various subsystems, particularly economic,
social, cultural, and human resources subsystems, is a key aspect of urban
sustainability that has a direct impact on the quality of urbanization.
Hangzhou Metropolitan Circle composing Hangzhou, Huzhou, Jiaxing, Shaoxing, was
the first metropolitan circle approved by National Development and Reform
Commission (NDRC) as a demonstration of economic transformation. To evaluate
the coupling degree of the four cities and to analyze the coordinative
development in the three systems (Digital Economy System, Regional Innovation
System, and Talent Employment System), panel data of these four cities during
the period 2015-2022 were collected. The development level of these three
systems were evaluated using standard deviation and comprehensive development
index evaluation. The results are as follows: (1) the coupling coordination
degree of the four cities in Hangzhou Metropolitan Circle has significant
regional differences, with Hangzhou being a leader while Huzhou, Jiaxing,
Shaoxing have shown steady but slow progress in the coupling development of the
three systems; and (2) the development of digital economy and talent employment

"Solving Word-Sense Disambiguation and Word-Sense Induction with
  Dictionary Examples","Many less-resourced languages struggle with a lack of large, task-specific
datasets that are required for solving relevant tasks with modern
transformer-based large language models (LLMs). On the other hand, many
linguistic resources, such as dictionaries, are rarely used in this context
despite their large information contents. We show how LLMs can be used to
extend existing language resources in less-resourced languages for two
important tasks: word-sense disambiguation (WSD) and word-sense induction
(WSI). We approach the two tasks through the related but much more accessible
word-in-context (WiC) task where, given a pair of sentences and a target word,
a classification model is tasked with predicting whether the sense of a given
word differs between sentences. We demonstrate that a well-trained model for
this task can distinguish between different word senses and can be adapted to
solve the WSD and WSI tasks. The advantage of using the WiC task, instead of
directly predicting senses, is that the WiC task does not need pre-constructed
sense inventories with a sufficient number of examples for each sense, which
are rarely available in less-resourced languages. We show that sentence pairs
for the WiC task can be successfully generated from dictionary examples using
LLMs. The resulting prediction models outperform existing models on WiC, WSD,
and WSI tasks. We demonstrate our methodology on the Slovene language, where a
monolingual dictionary is available, but word-sense resources are tiny.",Tadej Škvorc; Marko Robnik-Šikonja,arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04328v1,False,True,False,False,False,3059.0,Colleen Heflin,Cornell,Active,,https://doi.org/10.1080/01638539809545028,"Computer science, Natural language processing, Artificial intelligence, Latent semantic analysis, Word (group theory), Variety (cybernetics), Vocabulary, Meaning (existential), Linguistics, Similarity (geometry), Set (abstract data type), Psychology, Philosophy, Image (mathematics), Psychotherapist, Programming language",University of Colorado Boulder; New Mexico State University,"Department of Psychology, New Mexico State University; Department of Psychology, University of Colorado-Boulder.","Department of Psychology, New Mexico State University; Department of Psychology, University of Colorado-Boulder."

"Globalization, Technology, and the Skill Premium: A Quantitative Analysis","We construct a model of international trade and multinational production (MP) to examine the impact of globalization on the skill premium in skill-abundant and skill-scarce countries.The key mechanisms in our framework arise from the interaction between three elements: cross-country differences in factor endowments and sectoral productivities, technological heterogeneity across producers within sectors, and skill-biased technology.Reductions in trade and/or MP costs induce a reallocation of resources towards a country's comparative advantage sector (increasing the skill premium in skill-abundant countries and reducing it in skill-scarce countries) and within sectors towards more productive and skill-intensive producers (increasing the skill premium in all countries).We parameterize the model to match salient features of the extent and composition of trade and MP between the U.S. and skill-abundant and skill-scarce countries in 2006.We show that a reduction in trade and MP costs, moving from autarky to 2006 levels of trade and MP, increases the skill premium by roughly 5% in skill-abundant and skill-scarce countries.We also show that the growth in US trade and MP between 1966 and 2006 accounts for 1/9th of the 24% rise in the US skill premium over this period.MP is at least as important as international trade in generating this rise in the skill premium.",Ariel Burstein; Jonathan Vogel,,,,,,,,,,,,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w16459,"Globalization, Economics, Business, Econometrics, Market economy","National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University; University of California, Los Angeles","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Bunche Hall 8365 Box 951477 UCLA Los Angeles, CA 90095-1477; Department of Economics Columbia University 420 West 118th Street New York, NY 10027","Department of Economics Bunche Hall 8365 Box 951477 UCLA Los Angeles, CA 90095-1477; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Columbia University 420 West 118th Street New York, NY 10027"
Tariff effects on MNC decisions to engage in intra‐firm and arm's‐length trade,"Abstract Using confidential firm‐level data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on activities of U.S. multinational corporations (MNCs) and their Canadian affiliates, we study the dramatic growth of intra‐firm and arm's‐length U.S.‐Canada trade over the 1984–95 period. We find that decisions to engage in intra‐firm and arm's‐length trade are essentially unrelated to tariff and transport cost reductions over this sample period. Thus, we find that the increase in trade occurred almost entirely on the intensive rather than the extensive margin. This is consistent with case study evidence in Keane and Feinberg (2006), where MNC executives consistently indicate that the modest tariff reductions of the 1984–95 period were not sufficient to justify fixed costs of overhauling international supply chains. Our results have important implications for recent influential models of international trade that rely on sensitivity of intra‐firm trade to tariffs at the extensive margin to explain how small tariff declines could have led to the explosion of intra‐firm trade since the 1980s. We also find that initial conditions (i.e., 1983 tariffs) are uncorrelated with whether firms engaged in intra‐firm or arm's‐length trade activity at the start of the sample period. This result is surprising as it implies that firms/industries with a greater propensity to engage in trade were not, in general, successful at lobbying for more favourable tariff treatment.",Michael P.

"Product Differentiation, Multi-product Firms and Estimating the Impact of Trade Liberalization on Productivity","In this paper I analyze the productivity gains from trade liberalization in the Belgian textile industry.So far, empirical research has established a strong relationship between opening up to trade and productivity, relying almost entirely on deflated sales to proxy for output in the production function.The latter implies that the resulting productivity estimates still capture price and demand shocks which are most likely to be correlated with the change in the operating environment, which invalidate the evaluation of the welfare implications.In order to get at the true productivity gains I propose a simple methodology to estimate a production function controlling for unobserved prices by introducing an explicit demand system.I combine a unique data set containing matched plant-level and product-level information with detailed product-level quota protection information to recover estimates for productivity as well as parameters of the demand side (markups).I find that when correcting for unobserved prices and demand shocks, the estimated productivity gains from relaxing protection are only half (from 8 to only 4 percent) of those obtained with standard techniques.",Jan De Loecker,,,,,,,,,,,,2007.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w13155,"Product differentiation, Productivity, Product (mathematics), Liberalization, Industrial organization, Economics, Business, International trade, International economics, Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Mathematics, Market economy, Geometry, Cournot competition",New York University; Federal Reserve Board of Governors; University of Minnesota; Center for Economic and Policy Research; National Bureau of Economic Research,"NYU, U of Toronto, UT Austin, UCSC, IESE, Federal Board of Governors, LSE, WZB, NY Fed and conference; participants at IIOC 2005, CEPR Applied; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Stern School of Business New York University 44 West Fourth Street New York, NY 10012 and; University of Minnesota, Yale, Louvain-la-Neuve, KU Leuven, Princeton,","NYU, U of Toronto, UT Austin, UCSC, IESE, Federal Board of Governors, LSE, WZB, NY Fed and conference; participants at IIOC 2005, CEPR Applied; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Stern School of Business New York University 44 West Fourth Street New York, NY 10012 and; University of Minnesota, Yale, Louvain-la-Neuve, KU Leuven, Princeton,"
From Innovation to Exporting or Vice Versa?,"Abstract Firm productivity and export decisions are closely related to innovation activity. Innovation may play a more important role in the decision to start exporting, and successful exporting may drive process innovation. This suggests that the causality between innovation and exporting may run in both directions. Using detailed microdata from innovation surveys, industrial production surveys, and trade information for Slovenian firms in 1996–2002, we investigate the bidirectional causal relationship between firm innovation and export activity. We find no evidence for the hypothesis that either product or process innovations increase the probability of becoming a first‐time exporter, but we do find evidence in both the innovation survey and the industrial production survey that exporting leads to productivity improvements. These, however, are likely to be related to process rather than product innovations, and are observed only in a sample of medium and large first‐time exporters. This finding makes a case in favour of the learning‐by‐exporting hypothesis by demonstrating that these learning effects from exporting occur through the mechanism of process innovation enhancing firm technical efficiency.",Jože P.

Multiproduct Firms and Product Turnover in the Developing World: Evidence from India,"This paper provides evidence on the patterns of multiproduct firm production in a large developing country, India, during a period that spans market reforms. In the cross-section, multiproduct firms in India look remarkably similar to their U.S. counterparts. The time-series patterns, however, exhibit important differences. In contrast to evidence from the United States, product churning, particularly product rationalization, is far less common in India. We find no link between product rationalization and output tariff declines following India's 1991 trade liberalization. The lack of ""creative destruction"" is consistent with the role of industrial regulation in preventing an efficient allocation of resources.",Amit K Khandelwal; Amit Khandelwal; Nina Pavcnik; Petia Topalova; Pinelopi Goldberg; Pinelopi K Goldberg,,,,,,,,,,,,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00047,"Rationalization (economics), Churning, Economics, Tariff, Liberalization, Product market, Developing country, Product (mathematics), International economics, Business, Industrial organization, International trade, Market economy, Labour economics, Microeconomics, Economic growth, Geometry, Mathematics, Incentive",Bread for the World Institute; Dartmouth College; Institute of Materials Finishing; Princeton University,"Asia and Pacific Department, IMF; Dartmouth College, BREAD, CEPR, and NBER; Princeton University, BREAD, and NBER; Columbia Business School, BREAD, and NBER","Asia and Pacific Department, IMF; Dartmouth College, BREAD, CEPR, and NBER; Princeton University, BREAD, and NBER; Columbia Business School, BREAD, and NBER"

Export Versus FDI with Heterogeneous Firms,"This paper builds a multi-country, multi-sector general equilibrium model that explains the decision of heterogeneous firms to serve foreign markets either through exports or local subsidiary sales (FDI).These modes of market access involve different relative costs, some of which are sunk while others vary with sales volume (such as transport costs and tariffs).Relative to investment in a subsidiary, exporting involves lower sunk costs but higher per-unit costs.In equilibrium, only the more productive firms choose to serve the foreign markets and the most productive among this group will further choose to serve the overseas market via FDI.The paper then explores several implications of the individual firms' decisions for aggregate export and FDI sales relative to the domestic and foreign market sizes.In particular, it is shown that firm level heterogeneity is an important determinant of relative export and FDI flows.We use the model to derive testable empirical predictions on the relative aggregate export and FDI sales in a given country for a given sector based both on relative costs and the extent of firm level heterogeneity in that sector.These predictions are tested on data of US affiliate sales and US exports in 38 different countries and 52 sectors.The comparative statics based on relative costs are very similar to those tested by Brainard (AER 1997) and are confirmed in our data: sector/country specific transport costs and tariffs have a strong negative effect on export sales relative to FDI.More importantly, our new predictions for the effects of firm-level heterogeneity on the relative export and FDI sales are also strongly supported by the data: more heterogeneity leads to significantly more FDI sales relative to export sales.",Elhanan Helpman; Marc J Melitz; Marc J.

"Market Size, Trade, and Productivity","We develop a monopolistically competitive model of trade with firm heterogeneity—in terms of productivity differences—and endogenous differences in the “toughness” of competition across markets—in terms of the number and average productivity of competing firms. We analyse how these features vary across markets of different size that are not perfectly integrated through trade; we then study the effects of different trade liberalization policies. In our model, market size and trade affect the toughness of competition, which then feeds back into the selection of heterogeneous producers and exporters in that market. Aggregate productivity and average mark-ups thus respond to both the size of a market and the extent of its integration through trade (larger, more integrated markets exhibit higher productivity and lower mark-ups). Our model remains highly tractable, even when extended to a general framework with multiple asymmetric countries integrated to different extents through asymmetric trade costs. We believe this provides a useful modelling framework that is particularly well suited to the analysis of trade and regional integration policy scenarios in an environment with heterogeneous firms and endogenous mark-ups.",GIANMARCO I.

International Technology Diffusion,"This paper surveys what is known about the extent of international technology diffusion and channels through which technology spreads. Productivity differences explain much of the variation in incomes across countries, and technology plays a key role in determining productivity. The pattern of worldwide technical change is determined largely by international technology diffusion because a few rich countries account for most of the world's creation of new technology. Cross-country income convergence turns on whether technology diffusion is global or local. There is no indication that international diffusion is inevitable or automatic, but rather, domestic technology investments are necessary. Better understanding of what determines the effectiveness of technology diffusion sheds light on the pace at which the world's technology frontier may expand.",Wolfgang Keller,,,,,,,,,,,,2004.0,https://doi.org/10.1257/0022051042177685,"Pace, Productivity, Frontier, Diffusion, Convergence (economics), Economics, Economic geography, International trade, Technological change, Diffusion of innovations, Regional science, Business, Industrial organization, Development economics, Economic growth, Macroeconomics, Marketing, Geography, Physics, Archaeology, Geodesy, Thermodynamics",Center for Economic and Policy Research,"University of Texas, Austin; NBER and CEPR.","University of Texas, Austin; NBER and CEPR."
The Variety and Quality of a Nation's Exports,"Large economies export more in absolute terms than do small economies. We use data on shipments by 126 exporting countries to 59 importing countries in 5,000 product categories to answer the question: How? Do big economies export larger quantities of each good (the intensive margin), a wider set of goods (the extensive margin), or higher-quality goods? We find that the extensive margin accounts for around 60 percent of the greater exports of larger economies. Within categories, richer countries export higher quantities at modestly higher prices. We compare these findings to some workhorse trade models. Models with Armington national product differentiation have no extensive margin, and incorrectly predict lower prices for the exports of larger economies. Models with Krugman firm-level product differentiation do feature a prominent extensive margin, but overpredict the rate at which variety responds to exporter size. Models with quality differentiation, meanwhile, can match the price facts. Finally, models with fixed costs of exporting to a given market might explain the tendency of larger economies to export a given product to more countries.",David Hummels; Peter J Klenow; Peter J.

Across-Product Versus Within-Product Specialization in International Trade,"This paper exploits product-level U. S. import data to test trade theory. Although the United States increasingly sources the same products from both high- and low-wage countries, unit values within products vary systematically with exporter relative factor endowments and exporter production techniques. These facts reject factor-proportions specialization across products but are consistent with such specialization within products. The data are inconsistent with new trade theory models predicting an inverse relationship between price and producer productivity. The existence of within-product specialization is an important consideration for understanding the impact of globalization on firms and workers, the evolution of total factor productivity, and the likelihood of long-run income convergence.",P.

Markups and Firm-Level Export Status,"In this paper, we develop a method to estimate markups using plant-level production data. Our approach relies on cost-minimizing producers and the existence of at least one variable input of production. The suggested empirical framework relies on the estimation of a production function and provides estimates of plant-level mark-ups without specifying how firms compete in the product market. We rely on our method to explore the relationship between markups and export behavior. We find that markups are estimated significantly higher when controlling for unobserved productivity; that exporters charge, on average, higher markups and that markups increase upon export entry.

Innovating Firms and Aggregate Innovation,"We develop a parsimonious model of innovation to confront firm‐level evidence. It captures the dynamics of individual heterogeneous firms, describes the behavior of an industry with firm entry and exit, and delivers a general equilibrium model of technological change. While unifying the theoretical analysis of firms, industries, and the aggregate economy, the model yields insights into empirical work on innovating firms. It accounts for the persistence of firms’ R&D investment, the concentration of R&D among incumbents, the link between R&D and patenting, and why R&D as a fraction of revenues is positively correlated with firm productivity but not with firm size or growth.",Samuel Kortum; Tor Jakob Klette; Tor Jakob Klette,,,,,,,,,,,,2004.0,https://doi.org/10.1086/422563,"Productivity, Industrial organization, Investment (military), Economics, Revenue, Technological change, Aggregate (composite), Work (physics), General equilibrium theory, Microeconomics, Business, Macroeconomics, Materials science, Composite material, Mechanical engineering, Accounting, Politics, Political science, Law, Engineering",University of Oslo; Centre for Economic Policy Research; University of Minnesota; Economic Policy Institute; National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis,"University of Oslo and Centre for Economic Policy Research; University of Minnesota, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and National Bureau of Economic Research","University of Oslo and Centre for Economic Policy Research; University of Minnesota, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and National Bureau of Economic Research"
"Market Entry Costs, Producer Heterogeneity, and Export Dynamics","As the exchange rate, foreign demand, production costs and export promotion policies evolve, manufacturing firms are continually faced with two issues: Whether to be an exporter, and if so, how much to export.We develop a dynamic structural model of export supply that characterizes these two decisions and estimate the model using plant-level panel data on Colombian chemical producers.The model embodies uncertainty, plant-level heterogeneity in export profits, and sunk entry costs for plants breaking into foreign markets.Our estimates, and the simulation exercises that they support, yield several implications.First, entry costs are typically large, but vary greatly across producers.Second, there is substantial cross-plant heterogeneity in gross expected export profit streams.Third, these large entry costs make expectations about future exporting conditions important for many producers, so changes in the exchange rate regime that are credible induce much more entry than those that are not.Fourth, however, most of the entry and exit takes place among marginal exporters who contribute little to aggregate export revenues.Finally, subsidies on export earnings have a much larger impact on export revenues (per dollar spent) than subsidies that reduce the entry costs faced by new exporters.",James R.

Comparative advantage and heterogeneous firms,"This paper presents a model of international trade that features heterogeneous firms, relative endowment differences across countries, and consumer taste for variety.The paper demonstrates that firm reactions to trade liberalization generate endogenous Ricardian productivity responses at the industry level that magnify countries' comparative advantage.Focusing on the wide range of firm-level reactions to falling trade costs, the model also shows that, as trade costs fall, firms in comparative advantage industries are more likely to export, that relative firm size and the relative number of firms increases more in comparative advantage industries and that job turnover is higher in comparative advantage industries than in comparative disadvantage industries.",Andrew B.

Imported Inputs and Productivity,"We estimate a model of importers in Hungarian microdata and conduct counterfactual analysis to investigate the effect of imported inputs on productivity. We find that importing all input varieties would increase a firm’s revenue productivity by 22 percent, about one-half of which is due to imperfect substitution between foreign and domestic inputs. Foreign firms use imports more effectively and pay lower fixed import costs. We attribute one-quarter of Hungarian productivity growth during the 1993–2002 period to imported inputs. Simulations show that the productivity gain from a tariff cut is larger when the economy has many importers and many foreign firms.

"Innovation, Firm Dynamics, and International Trade","We present a general equilibrium model of the response of firms’ decisions to operate, innovate, and engage in international trade to a change in the marginal cost of international trade. We find that, although a change in trade costs can have a substantial impact on heterogeneous firms’ exit, export, and process innovation decisions, the impact of changes in these decisions on welfare is largely offset by the response of product innovation.

The International Price System,"I define and provide empirical evidence for an ""International Price System"" in global trade employing data for thirty-five developed and developing countries.This price system is characterized by two features.First, the overwhelming share of world trade is invoiced in very few currencies, with the dollar the dominant currency.Second, international prices, in their currency of invoicing, are not very sensitive to exchange rates at horizons of up to two years.In this system, a good proxy for a country's inflation sensitivity to exchange rate fluctuations is the fraction of its imports invoiced in a foreign currency.U.S. inflation is consequently more insulated from exchange rate shocks, while other countries are highly sensitive to it.Exchange rate depreciations (appreciations) make U.S. exports cheaper (expensive), while for other countries they mainly raise (lower) mark-ups and hence profits.U.S. monetary policy has spillover effects on inflation in other countries, while spillovers from other countries monetary policies on to U.S. inflation are more muted.",Gita Gopinath,,,,,,,,,,,,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w21646,"Computer science, Econometrics, Economics",National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University Press,"Department of Economics Harvard University 1875 Cambridge Street Littauer 206 Cambridge, MA 02138; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138","Department of Economics Harvard University 1875 Cambridge Street Littauer 206 Cambridge, MA 02138; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138"

The calibrated model implies that the gains from trade can be twice as high as the gains calculated in trade-only models, while the gains from MP are slightly lower than the gains computed in MP-only models.",Andrés Rodríguez-Clare; Andrés Rodríguez‐Clare; Natalia Ramondo,,,,,,,,,,,,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1086/670136,"Openness to experience, Multinational corporation, Production (economics), Economics, International economics, International trade, Gains from trade, Trade barrier, Market size, Intermediate good, Microeconomics, Psychology, Social psychology, Finance","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Berkeley; Arizona State University","Arizona State University; University of California, Berkeley, and National Bureau of Economic Research","Arizona State University; University of California, Berkeley, and National Bureau of Economic Research"
What Determines Productivity?,"Economists have shown that large and persistent differences in productivity levels across businesses are ubiquitous. This finding has shaped research agendas in a number of fields, including (but not limited to) macroeconomics, industrial organization, labor, and trade. This paper surveys and evaluates recent empirical work addressing the question of why businesses differ in their measured productivity levels. The causes are manifold, and differ depending on the particular setting. They include elements sourced in production practices—and therefore over which producers have some direct control, at least in theory—as well as from producers' external operating environments. After evaluating the current state of knowledge, I lay out what I see are the major questions that research in the area should address going forward.

"Trade Liberalization, Intermediate Inputs, and Productivity: Evidence from Indonesia","This paper estimates the productivity gains from reducing tariffs on final goods and from reducing tariffs on intermediate inputs. Lower output tariffs can increase productivity by inducing tougher import competition, whereas cheaper imported inputs can raise productivity via learning, variety, and quality effects. We use Indonesian manufacturing census data from 1991 to 2001, which include plant-level information on imported inputs. The results show that a 10 percentage point fall in input tariffs leads to a productivity gain of 12 percent for firms that import their inputs, at least twice as high as any gains from reducing output tariffs.

The Causes and Costs of Misallocation,"Why do living standards differ so much across countries? A consensus in the development literature is that differences in productivity are a dominant source of these differences. But what accounts for productivity differences across countries? One explanation is that frontier technologies and best practice methods are slow to diffuse to low-income countries. The recent literature on misallocation offers a distinct but complementary explanation: low-income countries are not as effective in allocating their factors of production to their most efficient use. We provide our perspective on three key questions. First, how important is misallocation? Second, what are the causes of misallocation? And third, beyond the direct cost of lower contemporaneous output, are there additional costs associated with misallocation? A summary of our answers is as follows: Misallocation appears to be a substantial channel in accounting for productivity differences across countries, but the measured magnitude of the effects depends on the approach and context. Researchers have not yet found a dominant source of misallocation; instead, many specific factors seem to contribute a small part of the overall effect. Beyond the static cost of misallocation, we believe that the dynamic effects of misallocation on productivity growth are significant and deserve much more attention going forward.",Diego Restuccia; Richard Rogerson,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.31.3.151,"Productivity, Economics, Context (archaeology), Production (economics), Frontier, Perspective (graphical), Macroeconomics, History, Archaeology, Artificial intelligence, Computer science, Paleontology, Biology",National Bureau of Economic Research; Princeton University; University of Toronto,"Diego Restuccia is a Professor of Economics and a Canada Research Chair, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada, and a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Richard Rogerson is the Charles and Marie Robertson Professor of Public and International Affairs, Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, and a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.","Diego Restuccia is a Professor of Economics and a Canada Research Chair, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada, and a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Richard Rogerson is the Charles and Marie Robertson Professor of Public and International Affairs, Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, and a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts."
The Euro and Firm Restructuring,"Abstract One of the main drivers of European integration was the idea that a more integrated European economy would promote economic efficiency, allowing countries to fully exploit their competitive advantages, fostering factor mobility and increasing allocational efficiency. The euro was a crucial milestone along this path. The productivity growth has been relatively stronger in those countries and sectors that relied more on competitive devaluations to regain price competitiveness before the euro was adopted. This finding is confirmed by an analysis of firm-level data from the Italian manufacturing sector. This study finds that low-tech businesses, which arguably benefited most from devaluations, have been restructuring more since the adoption of the euro. Restructuring has entailed a shift of business focus from production to upstream and downstream activities, such as product design, advertising, marketing, and distribution, and a corresponding reduction in the share of blue-collar workers.",Fabiano Schivardi; Matteo Bugamelli; Roberta Zizza,,,,,,,,,,,,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.7208/chicago/9780226012858.003.0004,"Restructuring, Productivity, Business, Upstream (networking), Industrial organization, Milestone, Distribution (mathematics), Product (mathematics), Downstream (manufacturing), Economics, Market economy, Finance, Marketing, Macroeconomics, Engineering, History, Telecommunications, Mathematical analysis, Geometry, Mathematics, Archaeology",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Cagliari; Bank of Italy,"NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Bank of Italy Via Nazionale 91 00184 Rome Italy; Matteo Bugamelli Bank of Italy Via Nazionale 91 00184 Rome Italy; University of Cagliari Viale S.

Regional Analysis Using Census Bureau Microdata at the Center for Economic Studies,"Regional science research requires data sets with detailed geography. Dissemination of data sets with sufficient geographic specificity challenges statistical agencies in terms of protecting respondent privacy. The U.S. Census Bureau first released decennial census microdata in the 1960s. Today, public versions of largely demographic surveys enjoy widespread use but limit the geographic detail of individual observations. With business data, firm and establishment distributions are highly skewed, preventing release of public use microdata versions. To support its own statistical programs by giving external researchers access to internal versions of public use data files, the Census Bureau created the Center for Economic Studies (CES) and a national network of Research Data Centers (RDCs). This model permits researchers access to confidential economic and demographic data under secure, controlled conditions.

The relative sophistication of Chinese exports,"China's exports have grown dramatically over the last three decades in large part due to its rapid penetration of new product markets. To help address the implications of this growth for developed economies, this paper gauges the relative sophistication of Chinese exports along two dimensions. First, I measure China's export overlap with developed countries by comparing the set of products China exports to the United States with the bundle of products exported by the OECD. Second, I compare Chinese and other countries' exports within product markets in terms of the price they receive in the US market. While China's export overlap with the OECD is much greater than one would predict given its low wages, the prices that US consumers are willing to pay for China's exports are substantially lower than the prices they are willing to pay for OECD exports. This fact, as well as the increase in the 'OECD premium' over time, suggests that competition between China and the world's most developed economies may be less direct than their product-mix overlap implies. It may also reflect efforts by developed-country firms to compete with China by dropping their least sophisticated offerings and moving up the quality ladder. — Peter K. Schott",Peter K.

One Size Fits All? Heckscher-Ohlin Specialization in Global Production,"This paper introduces a new technique for testing the Heckscher-Ohlin model that allows for the possibility that countries with sufficiently disparate endowments specialize in unique subsets of goods. Results based upon industry-level data reject one-size-fits-all homogeneity in favor of Heckscher-Ohlin specialization. Results also reveal that industry-level data hide substantial intra-industry heterogeneity, violating the assumptions of the model and complicating the interpretation of results from earlier research. A methodology for adjusting industry output to reflect underlying product variation is introduced. Reestimation of the model using adjusted aggregates in place of standard industry classifications provides strong support for Heckscher-Ohlin specialization.",Peter K Schott; Peter K.

Why Does Capital Flow to Rich States?,"The magnitude and the direction of net international capital flows do not fit neoclassical models. The fifty U.S. states comprise an integrated capital market with very low barriers to capital flows, which makes them an ideal testing ground for neoclassical models. We develop a simple frictionless open economy model with perfectly diversified ownership of capital and find that capital flows among the states are consistent with the model. Therefore, the small size and ""wrong"" direction of net international capital flows are likely due to frictions associated with national borders, not to inherent flaws in the neoclassical model.",Ariell Reshef; Bent E Sørensen; Bent E.

Is Mexico A Lumpy Country?,"Mexico's experience before and after trade liberalization presents a challenge to neoclassical trade theory.Though labor abundant, it nevertheless exported skill-intensive goods and protected laborintensive sectors prior to liberalization.Post-liberalization, the relative wage of skilled workers rose.Courant and Deardorff (1992) have shown theoretically that an extremely uneven distribution of factors within a country can induce behavior at odds with overall comparative advantage.We demonstrate the importance of this insight for developing countries.We show that Mexican regions exhibit substantial variation in skill abundance, offer significantly different relative factor rewards, and produce disjoint sets of industries.This heterogeneity helps to both undermine Mexico's aggregate labor abundance and motivate behavior that is more consistent with relative skill abundance.",Andrew B.

Relative Wage Variation and Industry Location in the United Kingdom*,"Abstract This paper shows that both relative wages and industry structure vary considerably across regions of the United Kingdom. In accordance with the neoclassical model of trade, regions abundant in a factor (i) exhibit lower relative prices of that factor than regions scarce in the factor, and (ii) tend to specialize in a mix of industries intensive in the use of the factor. We show that this specialization leads UK regions to be asymmetrically exposed to external macroeconomic or international trade shocks.",Andrew B. Bernard; Helen Simpson; Peter K. Schott; Stephen J.

A Multi-Country Approach to Factor-Proportions Trade and Trade Costs,"Classic trade questions are reconsidered by generalizing a factor-proportions model to multiple countries, multi-stage production, and country-specific trade costs. We derive patterns of production specialization and trade for a matrix of countries that differ in relative endowments (columns) and trade costs (rows). We demonstrate how the ability to fragment production and/or a proportional change in all countries' trade costs alters these patterns. Production specialization and the volume of trade are higher with fragmentation for most countries but interestingly, for a large block of countries, these variables fall following fragmentation. Countries with moderate trade costs engage in market-oriented assembly, while those with lower trade costs engage in export-platform production. These two cases correspond to the concepts of horizontal and vertical affiliate production in the literature on multinational enterprises. Increases in specialization and the volume of trade accelerate as trade costs go to zero with and without fragmentation.",Anthony J. Venables; James R.

"Country Size, International Trade, and Aggregate Fluctuations in Granular Economies","This paper proposes a new mechanism by which country size and international trade affect macroeconomic volatility. We study a model with heterogeneous firms that are subject to idiosyncratic firm-specific shocks, calibrated to data for the 50 largest economies in the world. When the firm size distribution follows a power law with an exponent close to minus one, idiosyncratic shocks to large firms have an impact on aggregate volatility. Smaller countries have fewer firms and, thus, higher volatility. Trade opening makes the large firms more important, thus raising macroeconomic volatility. Trade can increase aggregate volatility by 15–20 percent in some small open economies.",Andrei A.

Trade and Growth with Heterogenous Firms,"This paper explores the impact of trade on growth when firms are heterogeneous.We find that greater openness produces anti-and pro-growth effects.The Melitz-model selection effects raises the expected cost of introducing a new variety and this tends to slow the rate of new-variety introduction and hence growth.The pro-growth effect stems from the impact that freer trade has on the marginal cost of innovating.The balance of the two effects is ambiguous with the sign depending upon the exact nature of the innovation technology and its connection to international trade in goods and ideas.We consider five special cases (these include the Grossman-Helpman, the Coe-Helpman and Rivera-Batiz-Romer models) two of which suggest that trade harms growth; the others predicting the opposite.",Frédéric Robert-Nicoud; Frédéric Robert‐Nicoud; Richard Baldwin,,,,,,,,,,,,2006.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w12326,"Business, Economics, Industrial organization, International trade",International Paper (United States); Hitotsubashi University; Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies,"seminar participants at Hitotsubashi University, LSE, University of Barcelona and at the 2005 CEPR European Workshop; Department of Geography and Environment, LSE, Houghton Street, UK-London WC2A 2AE.; Department of Geography and Environment London School of Economics Houghton Street London WC2A 2AE UNITED KINGDOM; Baldwin; Graduate Institute of International Studies, Av. de la Paix 11a, CH-1202 Geneva; Robert-Nicoud;; NBER Working Paper No. 12326; Graduate Institute of International Studies Av.

Are they really mighty giants when it comes to their impact on manufacturing employment? The authors attempt to answer this question by estimating the effects of trade with China and India on Argentina's industrial employment. They use a dynamic econometric model and industry level data to estimate the effects of trade with China and India on the level of employment in Argentina's manufacturing sector. Results suggest that trade with China and India only had a small negative effect on industrial employment, even during the swift trade liberalization of the 1990s.

"Trade Liberalization, Quality, and Export Prices","This paper presents theory and evidence from disaggregated Chinese data that tariff reductions induce a country's producers to upgrade the quality of their exports. We first document stylized facts regarding the effect of trade liberalization on export prices. Next, we develop an analytic framework that relates a firm's choice of quality to its access to imported intermediates. In the model, a reduction in import tariffs induces a firm to increase export quality and raise its export price in industries where the scope for quality differentiation is large and lower its export price in industries where the scope is small. The predictions are consistent with the stylized facts and are highly robust econometrically.",Haichao Fan; Stephen R.

Surviving the Global Financial Crisis: Foreign Ownership and Establishment Performance,"We examine the differential response of establishments to the recent global financial crisis with particular emphasis on the role of foreign ownership. Using a worldwide establishment panel dataset, we investigate how multinational subsidiaries around the world responded to the crisis relative to local establishments. We find that, first, multinational subsidiaries fared on average better than local counterfactuals with similar economic characteristics. Second, among multinational subsidiaries, establishments sharing stronger vertical production and financial linkages with parents exhibited greater resilience. Finally, in contrast to the crisis period, the effect of foreign ownership and linkages on establishment performance was insignificant in noncrisis years.

Trade Adjustment: Worker-Level Evidence *,"Abstract We analyze the effect of exposure to international trade on earnings and employment of U.S. workers from 1992 through 2007 by exploiting industry shocks to import competition stemming from China’s spectacular rise as a manufacturing exporter paired with longitudinal data on individual earnings by employer spanning close to two decades. Individuals who in 1991 worked in manufacturing industries that experienced high subsequent import growth garner lower cumulative earnings, face elevated risk of obtaining public disability benefits, and spend less time working for their initial employers, less time in their initial two-digit manufacturing industries, and more time working elsewhere in manufacturing and outside of manufacturing. Earnings losses are larger for individuals with low initial wages, low initial tenure, and low attachment to the labor force. Low-wage workers churn primarily among manufacturing sectors, where they are repeatedly exposed to subsequent trade shocks. High-wage workers are better able to move across employers with minimal earnings losses and are more likely to move out of manufacturing conditional on separation. These findings reveal that import shocks impose substantial labor adjustment costs that are highly unevenly distributed across workers according to their skill levels and conditions of employment in the pre-shock period.",David Autor; David Dorn; David H.

Import Competition and Quality Upgrading,"The production of high-quality goods is often viewed as a precondition for export success and economic development. We provide the first evidence that countries' import tariffs affect the rate at which they upgrade product quality. Our analysis uses highly disaggregated data covering exports from 56 countries across 10,000 products to the United States using a novel approach to measure quality. As predicted by distance-to-the-frontier models, we find that lower tariffs are associated with quality upgrading for products close to the world quality frontier, whereas lower tariffs discourage quality upgrading for products distant from the frontier.",Amit K.

Firm Exports and Multinational Activity Under Credit Constraints,We provide firm-level evidence that credit constraints restrict international trade and affect the pattern of multinational activity. We show that foreign affiliates and joint ventures in China have better export performance than private domestic firms in financially more vulnerable sectors. These results are stronger for destinations with higher trade costs and not driven by firm size or other sector characteristics. Our findings are consistent with multinational subsidiaries being less liquidity constrained because they can access foreign capital markets or funding from their parent company. They further suggest that FDI can alleviate the impact of domestic financial market imperfections on trade.,Kalina Manova; Shang-Jin Wei; Shang‐Jin Wei; Zhiwei Zhang,,,,,,,,,,,,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00480,"Multinational corporation, Business, Subsidiary, Foreign direct investment, China, Market liquidity, International trade, Destinations, International economics, Monetary economics, Economics, Finance, Tourism, Political science, Law, Macroeconomics",Stanford University; Center for Economic and Policy Research; Nomura Holdings (Japan); Columbia University,"Columbia University, CEPR, CIER, and NBER; Nomura Securities; Stanford University and NBER","Columbia University, CEPR, CIER, and NBER; Nomura Securities; Stanford University and NBER"
Is the International Border Effect Larger than the Domestic Border Effect? Evidence from U.S. Trade,"Many studies have found that international borders represent large barriers to trade. But how do international borders compare to domestic border barriers? We investigate international and domestic border barriers in a unified framework. We consider a data set of exports from individual U.S. states to foreign countries and combine it with trade flows within and between U.S. states. After controlling distance and country/state size, we find that relative to state-to-state trade, crossing an individual U.S. state’s domestic border entails a larger trade barrier than crossing the international U.S. border. This finding highlights the concentration of trade flows at the local level and the importance of factors such as informational barriers and transportation costs even for the relatively short distances associated with state-to-state trade.",Cletus C.

"Technology, International Trade, and Pollution from US Manufacturing","Pollution emitted by US manufacturers declined markedly over the past several decades, even as real manufacturing output increased. I first show that most of the decline in US manufacturing pollution has resulted from changing production processes (“technology”), rather than changes in the mix of goods produced. I then show that increased net imports of polluting goods (“international trade”) accounts for only a small portion of the pollution reductions from the changing mix of goods. Together, these two findings demonstrate that shifting polluting industries overseas explains only a minor part—less than 10 percent—of the cleanup of US manufacturing.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF POLLUTING PLANTS: A SPATIAL ANALYSIS*,"ABSTRACT This paper uses plant‐level EPA and Census data to examine spatial factors affecting environmental performance, as measured by air pollutant emissions and regulatory compliance. We find significant effects for compliance, but not for emissions. Compliance is positively spatially correlated, partly explained by spatial correlations in observed plant characteristics, suggesting influences of industry agglomeration. The use of spatial econometric methods shows only small effects of spatially lagged compliance status, and does not greatly change the estimated contributions of other spatially explicit factors.

The Iron Cage Revisited: Institutional Isomorphism and Collective Rationality in Organizational Fields,"Instead of examining why organizations are dissimilar, this study explores why organizations tend to be increasingly and inevitably homogenous in their forms and practices. Organizations in a similar line of work are structured into an organizational field by powerful forces that lead them to become similar. Rather than the causes of rationalization and bureaucratization suggested by Max Weber, including competition and the need for efficiency, institutional similarity is due to the structuration of organizational fields, a process caused largely by the state and the professions, which are the great rationalizers of the late 20th century. In highly structured organizational fields, rational efforts of individuals aggregately lead to structural, cultural, and output homogeneity. Homogenization is best captured by the concept of isomorphism, the process whereby one element in a population resembles others that confront the same environmental conditions. The two types of isomorphism are competitive and institutional. Three processes lead to organizational similarity: (1) coercive isomorphism stemming from political influence and the problem of legitimacy; (2) mimetic isomorphism resulting from uniform responses to uncertainty; and (3) normative isomorphism associated with professionalism. While these isomorphic processes improve organizational transactions, they do not necessarily increase internal efficiency. Twelve hypotheses are offered for further research about which organizational fields will be most homogenous. These hypotheses relate the impact of resource centralization and dependency, goal ambiguity and technical uncertainty, and professionalism and structuration on isomorphic change. Finally, useful implications of the study for theories of organizations and social change are offered. (TNM)",Paul DiMaggio; Paul J. DiMaggio; Walter W.

"Skill Gaps, Skill Shortages, and Skill Mismatches","Concerns over the supply of skills in the U.S. labor force, especially education-related skills, have exploded in recent years with a series of reports not only from employer-associated organizations but also from independent and even government sources making similar claims.

In this article, the author assesses the range of these charges as well as other evidence about skills in the labor force. Very little evidence is consistent with the complaints about a skills shortage, and a wide range of evidence suggests the complaints are not warranted.

Remote Work and City Structure,"We study the adoption of remote work within cities and its effect on city structure and welfare.We develop a dynamic model of a city in which workers can decide to work in the central business district (CBD) or partly at home.Working in the CBD allows them to interact with other commuters, which enhances their productivity through a standard production externality, but entails commuting costs.Switching between modes of labor delivery is costly, and workers face idiosyncratic preference shocks for remote work.We characterize the parameter set in which the city exhibits multiple stationary equilibria.Within this set, a coordination mechanism can lead to stationary equilibria in which most workers commute or most of them work partially from home.In these cases, large shocks in the number of commuters, like the recent lockdowns and selfisolation generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, can result in dynamic paths that make cities converge to a stationary equilibrium with large fractions of remote workers.Using cell-phonebased mobility data for the U.S., we document that although most cities experienced similar reductions in CBD trips during the pandemic, trips in the largest cities have stabilized at levels that are only about 60% of pre-pandemic levels.In contrast, smaller cities have, on average, returned to pre-pandemic levels.House price panel data by city show consistent changes in house price CBD-distance gradients.We estimate the model for 274 U.S. cities and show that cities that have stabilized at a large fraction of remote work are much more likely to have parameters that result in multiple stationary equilibria.Our results imply welfare losses in these cities that average 2.7%.",Charly Porcher; Esteban Rossi-Hansberg; Esteban Rossi‐Hansberg; Ferdinando Monte,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w31494,"Work (physics), Geology, Architectural engineering, Geography, Engineering, Mechanical engineering",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago; Georgetown University,"NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of Chicago 5757 S.

IntroductionMacroeconomic models of fluctuations in hours of work over the business cycle or across countries imply much larger labor supply elasticities than microeconometric estimates of hours elasticities. Understanding this divergence is critical for questions ranging from the sources of business cycles to the impacts of tax policy on growth and inequality. Starting with the seminal work of Rogerson (1988) and Hansen (1985), one leading explanation of the divergence is the extensive margin response created by indivisible labor supply. If labor supply is indivisible, changes in tax or wage rates can generate large changes in aggregate hours by inducing extensive margin (participation) responses even if they have little effect on hours conditional on employment. In view of this argument, modern macro models are calibrated to match low micro estimates of intensive margin elasticities. However, the extensive margin elasticity is usually treated as a free parameter that can be calibrated purely to match macroeconomic moments.We argue that the extensive margin elasticity should not be treated as a free parameter. Macro models should be calibrated to match micro estimates of extensive margin elasticities in the same way that they are calibrated to match micro estimates of intensive margin elasticities. The size of the extensive margin responses depends on the density of the distribution of reservation wages around the economy's equilibrium. The same marginal density that determines the impacts of macroeconomic variation on aggregate employment also determines the impacts of quasi-experiments such as tax policy changes on employment rates. Micro estimates of extensive margin elasticities can therefore be used to calibrate macro models.1In this paper, we assess whether existing calibrations of macro models are consistent with micro evidence on extensive margin responses. In doing so, we find that it is crucial to distinguish between two types of elasticities: Hicksian and Frisch. The Frisch (marginal utility constant) elasticity controls intertemporal substitution responses to temporary wage fluctuations and is therefore the relevant parameter for understanding labor supply fluctuations over the business cycle.2 The Hicksian (wealth constant) elasticity controls steady-state responses to permanent wage changes and is therefore the relevant parameter for understanding differences in labor supply across countries with different tax systems. We use two approaches to comparing macro calibrations with micro evidence: simulations of quasi-experiments and a meta-analysis of micro elasticity estimates. Both approaches show that micro and macro evidence agree about Hicksian (steady state) elasticities but disagree about Frisch (intertemporal substitution) elasticities.We begin by simulating the impacts of policy changes that generate exogenous changes in incentives to work in a standard macro model and comparing the predicted responses with the findings of microeconometric studies. We use Rogerson and Wallenius's (2009, henceforth, RW) calibrated model of life cycle labor supply as a benchmark model for this exercise. The RW model matches macro evidence by generating an intertemporal substitution elasticity of aggregate hours above 2 even when calibrated to generate a Frisch intensive-margin elasticity below 0.5. We simulate labor supply responses to three policies using this model: (1) a tax-free year in Iceland in 1987 studied by Bianchi, Gudmundsson, and Zoega (2001); (2) a randomized experiment providing temporary subsidies for work to welfare recipients in Canada (Card and Hyslop 2005); and (3) the 1994 expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for low-income individuals in the United States (Meyer and Rosenbaum 2001). The first two examples are ideal for identifying Frisch elasticities because they induce temporary variation in wage rates. Bianchi, Gudmundsson, and Zoega (2001) find that employment rates in Iceland do indeed rise in 1987, but the increase is only one-fifth as large as that predicted by the RW model. Similarly, the calibrated RW model predicts intertemporal substitution responses to the work subsidies in Canada that are nearly four times larger than what Card and Hyslop observe in their data. The third example—the EITC expansion—generates permanent variation in tax rates and thus is well-suited for identifying steady-state elasticities. The RW model performs better in matching the impacts of the EITC expansion on employment rates because it generates a Hicksian aggregate hours elasticity of approximately 0.7, resulting in steady-state impacts of taxes on labor supply that are closer to micro estimates.While our quantitative results rest on the particular assumptions of the RW model, our qualitative conclusions apply more generally. Any macro model that relies primarily on changes in labor supply to generate business cycle fluctuations must feature a large extensive margin Frisch elasticity. As a result, any such model will overpredict the response to temporary wage changes such as the tax holiday in Iceland and work subsidies in Canada. Intuitively, fluctuations in employment over the business cycle and the employment effects of quasi-experimental wage changes are both fundamentally determined by the same density of the reservation wage distribution at the margin irrespective of model specification. Thus, any labor supply model that fits the quasi-experimental evidence cannot generate large fluctuations in employment over the business cycle.To explore whether the results of the three studies we consider in the simulations are representative of the broader empirical literature, we conduct a meta-analysis of quasi-experimental estimates of extensive margin elasticities. We summarize results from fifteen studies that span a broad range of countries, demographic groups, time periods, and sources of variation. These studies generally analyze changes in incentives for small subgroups of the population, permitting identification of labor supply elasticities that are not confounded by changes in equilibrium wage rates. Despite the great variation in methodologies, there is consensus about extensive margin elasticities. The mean extensive margin elasticity among the studies we consider is 0.28 and every estimate is below 0.43. The intertemporal substitution (Frisch) elasticity estimates for temporary policy changes turn out be quite similar to the steady-state elasticity estimates obtained from permanent policy changes. The small elasticities imply that most individuals are at a corner in their employment choices; that is, the density of individuals at the margin of employment is thin in practice.We conclude our analysis by evaluating whether extensive margin elasticities of around 0.25 as suggested by micro evidence are adequate to reconcile the gap between micro and macro estimates of aggregate hours elasticities. To do so, we summarize micro and macro estimates of Hicksian and Frisch elasticities on both the extensive and intensive margins. We find that micro and macro studies agree about the steady-state impacts of taxes on labor supply. Both micro and macro studies imply Hicksian extensive margin elasticities around 0.2. And both micro and macro evidence are consistent with intensive margin elasticities around 0.3 once one accounts for frictions that may attenuate observed micro estimates (Chetty, Friedman, et al. 2011; Chetty 2012). Prescott's (2004) widely-cited cross-country data set implies an aggregate hours (extensive plus intensive) Hicksian elasticity of 0.7, only slightly larger than micro estimates.3 These findings indicate that labor supply responses to taxation could indeed explain much of the variation in hours of work across countries with different tax systems.4On the intertemporal substitution margin, the limited existing evidence on intensive margin elasticities suggests that values around 0.5 are consistent with both micro and macro data. However, micro and macro estimates of extensive margin intertemporal substitution elasticities differ by an order of magnitude. Quasi-experimental estimates of extensive margin intertemporal substitution elasticities are around 0.25. In contrast, pure equilibrium macro models, in which employment fluctuations are driven purely by preferences, imply intertemporal substitution extensive margin elasticities in excess of 2. Hence, the puzzle to be resolved is why employment rates fluctuate so much over the business cycle relative to what one would predict based on the impacts of tax changes on employment rates—that is, why micro and macro estimates of the Frisch extensive margin elasticity are so different.5 Even accounting for indivisible labor, micro studies do not support representative-agent macro models that generate Frisch elasticities above 1.There are two potential concerns that one may have with using microeconomic estimates to calibrate macroeconomic models. The first is that heterogeneity in extensive margin responses complicates the mapping from micro estimates to macro elasticities that reflect economy-wide behavior.6 This problem is compounded by the concern that micro studies sometimes exclude important subgroups that could matter for economy-wide extensive margin responses (Dyrda, Kaplan, and Ríos-Rull 2012). In practice, however, heterogeneity across subgroups appears to strengthen our main conclusion about agreement on the Hicksian elasticity but disagreement on the Frisch elasticity. The heterogeneity in micro estimates of extensive-margin Hicksian elasticities mirrors the heterogeneity observed in macro studies of steady-state responses. For instance, both micro and macro studies indicate that extensive-margin elasticities are higher for subgroups that are less attached to the labor force, such as single mothers and individuals near retirement. However, heterogeneity magnifies the discrepancy between micro and macro estimates of intertemporal substitution elasticities. Most notably, employment rates fluctuate substantially over the business cycle even for prime-age males, which stands in sharp contrast with the near-zero micro extensive margin Frisch elasticity estimates for this group.A second potential concern in mapping micro estimates to macro labor supply elasticities is that reduced-form micro studies may not directly identify the structural primitives of the reservation wage distribution that control extensive margin labor supply choices. This is particularly a concern if frictions prevent the labor market from clearing, as our analysis suggests. In a model with frictions, reduced-form micro elasticity estimates represent a convolution of the density of the reservation wage distribution at the margin and other structural parameters, such as the distribution of adjustment costs or search frictions or the degree of liquidity constraints. Importantly, the same reduced-form elasticities would also determine the impact of wage changes on labor supply over the business cycle in such an environment. Hence, micro estimates should continue to provide useful targets for calibrating macro models even though they do not identify the structure of preferences or other primitives necessary for normative analysis.7 However, especially when reduced-form elasticities combine several structural parameters, they may not be stable across settings. Because of this instability, one should not seek to calibrate macro models to match any single estimate of a micro elasticity. Nevertheless, one can gauge the range of plausible magnitudes by pooling evidence from many different studies and settings as we do here. The fact that every quasi-experimental study we review finds elasticities significantly less than 0.5 casts doubt upon macro models calibrated with extensive margin elasticities above 1.The article is organized as follows. The next section briefly reviews the existing literature on indivisible labor. In section III, we establish a terminology for the various elasticity concepts, as these terms are often used in different ways in the existing literature. Section IV reports simulations of the three quasi-experiments in the Rogerson and Wallenius (2009) model. Section V presents the meta-analysis of micro estimates. In section VI, we compare micro and macro evidence on the intensive and extensive margins. Section VII concludes. Details of the simulation methods and meta-analysis are given in the appendix.II. Indivisible Labor: BackgroundEquilibrium macroeconomic models—in which differences in hours of work are driven by preferences—require large labor supply elasticities to explain the variation in hours of work over the business cycle and across countries with different tax regimes. In contrast, quasi-experimental microeconometric studies of the impacts of tax reforms on hours of work and earnings typically obtain elasticities close to zero for most groups except very high income earners.8A large literature has posited that the discrepancy between micro and macro elasticities can be explained by indivisibilities in labor (e.g., Hansen 1985; Rogerson 1988; Cho and Rogerson 1988; Christiano and Eichenbaum 1992; Cho and Cooley 1994; King and Rebelo 1999; Chang and Kim 2006; Ljungqvist and Sargent 2006; Prescott, Rogerson, and Wallenius 2009; Rogerson and Wallenius 2009).9 If individuals cannot freely choose hours of work or face fixed costs of entry, aggregate employment depends upon the distribution of reservation wages in the economy. If this distribution has substantial density at the margin—that is, many individuals are indifferent between working and not working at prevailing wage rates—then a small reduction in wage rates could reduce aggregate hours of work significantly because many individuals will stop working. Yet the same change in wage rates may not affect hours of work conditional on employment very much, implying a small intensive margin labor supply elasticity. As a result, a model with large extensive margin elasticities and small intensive margin elasticities could match both the micro and macro evidence. Motivated by these results, modern macro models are calibrated to match micro estimates of intensive margin elasticities but typically calibrate the extensive margin elasticity purely to match macroeconomic moments (King and Rebelo 1999; Rogerson and Wallenius 2009; Ljungqvist and Sargent 2011).In parallel with the development of macro models of indivisible labor supply, a large microeconometric literature has recognized the importance of the extensive margin in the analysis of labor supply. Ashenfelter (1984) and Heckman (1984) discuss the importance of extensive margin labor supply choices in the analysis of aggregate fluctuations. Heckman and Killingsworth (1986) and Heckman (1993) review the literature on labor supply models that explicitly model participation decisions. More recent research has estimated extensive margin elasticities using quasi-experimental methods.However, macro models have not been calibrated to match micro evidence on extensive margin elasticities. One complication in performing such a calibration is that extensive margin elasticities vary with the wage rate unless the density of the reservation wage distribution happens to be uniform. Hence, any micro estimate of an extensive margin elasticity is necessarily local to the wage variation used for identification. However, this argument does not justify treating the extensive margin elasticity as a free parameter for two reasons. First, if the micro estimates are identified using variation similar to that used in macroeconomic comparisons, one will obtain the appropriate local elasticity relevant for macro calibrations. Second, the same problem arises when calibrating macro models with micro estimates of intensive margin elasticities, insofar as elasticities will only be constant on the intensive margin if utility happens to produce a constant-elasticity labor supply function. We revisit this issue in section VI and show that, if anything, observable heterogeneity in elasticities reinforces the conclusions drawn later.III. TerminologyIt is helpful to establish some conventions about terminology given the various elasticity concepts discussed in this paper. We distinguish between elasticities based on the margin of response (extensive vs. intensive) and the timing of response (intertemporal substitution vs. steady state). There are four elasticities of interest: steady-state extensive, steady-state intensive, intertemporal extensive, and intertemporal intensive. Each of these four elasticities can be estimated using both micro (quasi-experimental) and macroeconomic variation. We use the terms ""micro"" and ""macro"" elasticities exclusively to refer to the source of variation used to estimate the elasticity. The elasticity of aggregate hours—the relevant parameter for calibrating a representative agent model—is the sum of the extensive and intensive margin elasticities, weighted by hours of work if individuals have heterogeneous preferences (Blundell, Bozio, and Laroque 2011).The macro literature uses the term ""macro elasticity"" to refer to the Frisch elasticity of aggregate hours and ""micro elasticity"" to refer to the intensive-margin elasticity of hours conditional on employment (e.g., Prescott 2004; Rogerson and Wallenius 2009). We use different terminology here for two reasons. First, the intensive-margin is no more ""micro"" than the extensive margin; both are determined by household-level choices and both have been estimated using micro data. Second, and more importantly, the Frisch elasticity is critical for understanding business cycle fluctuations in models where aggregate hours fluctuations are purely driven by labor supply, but it is not the relevant parameter for evaluating the steady-state impacts of differences in taxes across countries. The Frisch (marginal utility constant) elasticity controls intertemporal substitution responses to temporary wage fluctuations, while the Hicksian (wealth constant) elasticity controls steady-state responses and the welfare consequences of taxation (MaCurdy 1981; Auerbach 1985).10The distinction between Hicksian and Frisch elasticities is quite important in practice. Prescott (2004) reports that cross-country differences in aggregate hours imply an elasticity of 3 in a representative-agent model, whereas Davis and Henrekson (2005) estimate an elasticity of 0.33 using similar data. The difference arises primarily because Prescott reports a Frisch elasticity whereas Davis and Henrekson report a Hicksian elasticity. Regressing log hours on log tax rates in Prescott's data yields a Hicksian elasticity of 0.7, as shown in figure 2, panel A. Prescott maps this estimate of the Hicksian elasticity into a value for a Frisch elasticity based on parametric assumptions about utility and the wealth-earnings ratio. When utility is time-separable, the Frisch (εF) and Hicksian (εH) elasticities are related by the following identity (Ziliak and Kniesner 1999; Browning 2005):where ρ is the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS), (d[wl])/dA is the marginal propensity to earn out of unearned income, and A/wl is the ratio of assets to earnings. The reason that Prescott obtains a much larger value of εF than εH is that the parametric utility specification he uses produces large values of A/wl and (d[wl])/dA. However, microeconometric evidence shows that income effects on labor supply are much smaller than those produced by the Prescott utility specification (Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian, and Rosen 1993; Imbens, Rubin, and Sacerdote 2001). Under a utility specification that matches empirical estimates of the mean values of (d[wl])/dA and A/wl, the Frisch elasticity is only slightly larger than the Hicksian elasticity because the difference between the two elasticities is proportional to the income effect squared (d[wl]/dA)2 (Chetty 2012, table III).11IV. Simulations of Quasi-Experiments in the RW ModelWe evaluate whether macro models with indivisible labor are consistent with micro evidence on extensive margin responses by focusing on the Rogerson and Wallenius (2009) model. The RW model is a leading example of recent models of indivisible labor that aggregate over individuals by time-averaging over the life cycle, as in Ljungqvist and Sargent (2006). The model is well-suited for our purposes because it features both an extensive and intensive margin of labor supply. Rogerson and Wallenius calibrate their model to show that small intensive- margin micro elasticities are consistent with a large Frisch elasticity of aggregate hours. We adopt the parameters chosen by RW and simulate the impacts of policy changes analyzed in three prominent microeconometric studies.12Setup. RW analyze an overlapping-generations model in which a unit mass of agents is born at each instant and lives for one unit of time. An individual who supplies h(a) ∈ [0, 1] hours at age a produces efficiency units of labor, whereis a tent-shaped life cycle productivity profile and . Complete asset markets lead to perfect consumption smoothing. With log utility over consumption, each generation solveswhere τ is the tax rate and T is a lump-sum tax rebate that balances the government's budget. The model can be solved analytically as described in RW and in the technical appendix. Because wages are paid per efficiency unit, individuals have low hourly wage rates at the beginning and end of their lives and find it optimal not to work at those points. This generates an extensive margin of participation over the life cycle. The convex disutility over hours of work generates an intensive margin hours response to changes in wage rates as well. Rogerson and Wallenius normalize the price of output to 1 and assume a constant- returns-to-scale production technology, so changes in tax rates have no impact on pretax wages and prices. Accordingly, the quasi-experiments we simulate also hold pretax wages and prices constant, as the studies on which they are based typically analyze the impacts of differential changes in incentives for relatively small subgroups of the population.Rogerson and Wallenius calibrate the parameters α, e1, and to match empirically observed values for the fraction of life worked (f), the maximum hours worked per week over the life cycle (hmax), and the wage rate at retirement relative to the maximum wage rate over the life cycle (wR/wmax). Following RW, we set hmax = 45% (45 hours per week) and wR/ wmax = 1/2. We set f to match the aggregate employment rate in the period prior to each policy experiment we consider. The parameter controls the Frisch elasticity of labor supply, as in standard life cycle models (Card 1990). We set γ = 2 to obtain an intensive margin Frisch elasticity of εINT = 1/γ = 0.5, consistent with the microeconometric evidence summarized in the following; we show in appendix A that setting εINT = 0.25 yields similar results.13 For each of the three tax policy changes simulated in the following, we choose the model's remaining parameters {α, e1, } to match the moments {hmax, wR/wmax, f } under the tax system prior to the tax change.14 In all three cases, the calibrated model generates an intertemporal substitution elasticity for aggregate hours above 2 despite having an intensive margin intertemporal substitution elasticity of only 0.5, consistent with RW's main result.15 As in RW, we assume that each agent lives for sixty years (corresponding to average adult working lives) and simulate each quasi-experiment by changing the tax rate for the number of periods in the model that correspond to the duration of the tax policy change in the data.16To simulate the impacts of unanticipated tax changes, we must specify how the lump sum rebate T changes for each agent. To simplify aggregation, we assume that each generation receives a lump-sum rebate equal to the taxes they pay at each instant in time.17 We ignore heterogeneity in the tax system across individuals and set τ equal to the average tax rate for the subgroup analyzed (which is relevant for extensive margin decisions).Experiment 1: Tax holiday in Iceland. In 1987, Iceland suspended its income tax for one year as it transitioned from a system under which taxes were paid on the previous year's income to a system where taxes were paid on current earnings. In 1987, individuals paid tax on income earned in 1986; in 1988, individuals were taxed on income earned in 1988, and thus income in 1987 was untaxed. The average tax rate was 14.5 percent in 1986, 0 in 1987, and 8.0 percent in 1988 (Bianchi, Gudmundsson, and Zoega 2001). Although this tax change could also produce a change in labor demand due to a general equilibrium impact on wage rates, the tax holiday had no impact on labor supply for individuals with low initial tax rates (Bianchi, Gudmundsson, and Zoega 2001, figure 9). This implies that the general equilibrium feedback on wage rates was negligible, so the aggregate employment response can be interpreted as a labor supply elasticity.18 We simulate the tax reform in Iceland in the RW model under the assumption that the tax system remains stable prior to 1986 and after 1988. The reform was announced in late 1986, so we model the tax change as an unanticipated change at the start of 1987. The average employment rate in the three-year period prior to the reform is f = 79.2%, which implies that individuals work for 47.5 years in the model. The single-year tax reduction thus comes close to the ideal experiment for identifying a Frisch elasticity of reducing tax rates for an infinitesimal fraction of the working life.Panel A of figure 1 plots annual changes in employment rates (the employment rate in year t minus the employment rate in year t – 1) around the reform, demarcated by the vertical line. The Icelandic administrative records analyzed by Bianchi and colleagues (squares) show a modest but significant increase in employment rates in 1987 followed by a sharp dip in 1988, consistent with intertemporal substitution. The impact predicted by the RW model (circles) is an order of magnitude larger than the observed impact. In the data, employment is 3 percentage points higher in 1987 relative to 1988, but the RW model predicts that it would be 13.5 percentage points higher. The model generates a much larger spike in employment because the fraction of cohorts that are close to being indifferent between working and staying out of the labor force is large. The temporary increase in the wage rates therefore induces a large group of agents to work. Note that it is precisely this mechanism—having a large fraction of individuals near the margin—that allows the RW model to generate a large Frisch elasticity for aggregate hours and thus explain fluctuations in aggregate hours over the business cycle.Fig. 1. Impacts of tax changes on employment rates: Simulations versus dataNotes: Each panel shows the impact of an unanticipated change in incentives to work on employment rates. The dashed series shows the impact predicted by the calibrated Rogerson and Wallenius (2009) model, while the solid series shows the impact observed in the data. Panel A: Iceland suspended its income tax for one year in 1987. Average tax rates in Iceland changed from 14.5 percent in 1986 to 0 percent in 1987 and then 8.0 percent in 1988. Following Bianchi, Gudmunsson, and Zoega (2001), we define the employment rate as the fraction of weeks worked in a given year in the adult population. This panel plots annual changes in employment rates. Panel B: The Canadian SSP demonstration randomly assigned a group of welfare recipients a wage subsidy for thirty-six months in the early 1990s. Individuals in the control group faced an effective average tax rate of 74.3 percent for working full time at the minimum wage, while individuals in the treatment group faced an effective average tax rate of 16.7 percent. Following Card and Hyslop (2005), we plot the difference in monthly employment rates between the treatment and control groups. We add the observed control group mean at the start of the experiment (23.5 percent) to the difference for scaling purposes. Simulated employment rates are the fraction of individuals aged sixteen to forty-six working in a given month, reflecting the age distribution of the SSP treatment group (see appendix A).

The Growth in Social Security Benefits Among the Retirement Age Population from Increases in the Cap on Covered Earnings,"This paper investigates how increases in the level of maximum earnings subject to the Social Security payroll tax have affected Social Security benefits and taxes.The analysis uses data from the Health and Retirement Study to ask how different the present value of own benefits and taxes would be for the cohort born from 1948 to 1953 (ages 51 to 56 in 2004) if they faced the lower cap on the payroll tax that faced those born twelve and twenty four years earlier, but otherwise had the same earnings stream and faced the same benefit formula.We find that for those in the Early Boomer cohort of the Health and Retirement Study, ages 51 to 56 in 2004, that after adjusting for nominal wage growth, benefits were increased by 1.5 percent by the increase in the payroll tax ceiling compared to the cohort twelve years older, and by 3.7 percent over the benefits under the payroll tax ceiling for the cohort twenty four years older.Tax receipts were increased by 5.3 and 10.7 percent over tax receipts that would have been collected under the tax ceilings that applied to the cohorts 12 and 24 years older respectively.About 25 percent of the additional tax revenues created by the increase in the payroll tax cap between the Early Boomer cohort and those twelve years older was diverted to increased benefits.Similarly, about 31 percent of the additional tax revenues created by the increase in the payroll tax cap between the Early Boomer cohort and those twenty four years older took the form of increased benefits.Results are also presented separately for men and women, for those in the top quartile of earners, and for those at the tax ceiling throughout their work lives.",Alan Gustman; Alan L.

Do the Rich Save More?,"The question of whether higher–lifetime income households save a larger fraction of their income was the subject of much debate in the 1950s and 1960s, and while not resolved, it remains central to the evaluation of tax and macroeconomic policies. We resolve this long‐standing question using new empirical methods applied to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the Survey of Consumer Finances, and the Consumer Expenditure Survey. We find a strong positive relationship between saving rates and lifetime income and a weaker but still positive relationship between the marginal propensity to save and lifetime income. There is little support for theories that seek to explain these positive correlations by relying solely on time preference rates, nonhomothetic preferences, or variations in Social Security benefits. There is more support for models emphasizing uncertainty with respect to income and health expenses, bequest motives, and asset‐based means testing or behavioral factors causing minimal saving rates among low‐income households.",Jonathan Skinner; Karen E.

How Progressive is the U.S. Federal Tax System? A Historical and International Perspective,"This paper provides estimates of federal tax rates by income groups in the United States since 1960, with special emphasis on very top income groups. We include individual and corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, and estate and gift taxes. The progressivity of the U.S. federal tax system at the top of the income distribution has declined dramatically since the 1960s. This dramatic drop in progressivity is due primarily to a drop in corporate taxes and in estate and gift taxes combined with a sharp change in the composition of top incomes away from capital income and toward labor income. The sharp drop in statutory top marginal individual income tax rates has contributed only moderately to the decline in tax progressivity. International comparisons confirm that is it critical to take into account other taxes than the individual income tax to properly assess the extent of overall tax progressivity, both for time trends and for cross-country comparisons. The pattern for the United Kingdom is similar to the U.S. pattern. France had less progressive taxes than the United States or the United Kingdom in 1970 but has experienced an increase in tax progressivity and has now a more progressive tax system than the United States or the United Kingdom.",Emmanuel Saez; Thomas Piketty,,,,,,,,,,,,2007.0,https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.21.1.3,"Economics, Gross income, State income tax, Income tax, Value-added tax, Indirect tax, Progressive tax, Tax reform, Labour economics, Tax deferral, Direct tax, Ad valorem tax, International taxation, Adjusted gross income, Public economics","National Bureau of Economic Research; Paris School of Economics; University of California, Berkeley; Centre for Economic Policy Research","Professor of Economics, University of California, Berkeley, California, and Research Associate, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Professor of Economics, Paris School of Economics (PSE), Paris, France, and a Research Fellow, Centre for Economic Policy Research, London, United Kingdom.","Professor of Economics, University of California, Berkeley, California, and Research Associate, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Professor of Economics, Paris School of Economics (PSE), Paris, France, and a Research Fellow, Centre for Economic Policy Research, London, United Kingdom."
Structural Reform of Social Security,"overnments around the world have enacted or are currently considering fundamental structural reforms of their Social Security pension programs. 1The key feature in these reforms is a shift from a pure pay-asyou-go tax-financed system, in which taxes on current workers are primarily distributed to current retirees, to a mixed system that combines pay-as-you-go benefits with investment-based personal retirement accounts.Countries as different as Australia, Chile, China, Britain and Sweden have already adopted mixed systems of this type (Feldstein, 1998; Feldstein and Siebert, 2002).In the United States, President Clinton almost proposed such a plan (Elmendorf, Liebman and Wilcox, 2001), and President Bush has made it a major priority for his second term.This paper will first explain how Social Security works now, how a mixed system could work in practice, and how the transition to such a change could be achieved.I discuss the economic gains that would result from shifting to a mixed system.I then turn to the three problems that critics raise about any investment-based plan: administrative costs, risk and income distribution.Finally, I comment on some of the ad hoc proposals for dealing with the financial problem of Social Security without shifting to an investment-based system.1 For a more general discussion of the reform of social insurance programs, including unemployment insurance and health insurance, see my 2005 presidential address to the American Economic Association (Feldstein, 2005a).",Martin Feldstein,,,,,,,,,,,,2005.0,https://doi.org/10.1257/0895330054048731,"Social security, Investment (military), Work (physics), Economics, Pension, Public economics, Business, Economic policy, Finance, Market economy, Politics, Political science, Law, Mechanical engineering, Engineering",National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"Professor of Economics, Harvard University, and President of the National Bureau of Economic Research, both in Cambridge, Massachusetts.","Professor of Economics, Harvard University, and President of the National Bureau of Economic Research, both in Cambridge, Massachusetts."
Lifetime Earnings in the United States over Six Decades,"Between the 1957 and 1983 labor market entry cohorts, median lifetime earnings declined by 10–19 percent for men and increased by 22–33 percent for women, albeit relative to very low median lifetime earnings for the early cohorts. The difference between newer and older cohorts comes from differences in median earnings at the time of labor market entry. Inequality in lifetime earnings has increased significantly within each gender group, but the closing lifetime gender gap has kept overall lifetime inequality flat. The increase among men is largely attributable to subsequent cohorts entering the labor market with progressively higher levels of inequality.

The Progressivity of Social Security,"How much does the current social security system really redistribute from rich to poor?We use the PSID to estimate lifetime wage profiles and actual earnings each year for a sample of 1778 individuals, and we use mortality probabilities to calculate expected payroll taxes and social security benefits.For a given set of ""facts"" about the net flows received by each individual, measured progressivity depends on many assumptions.This paper attempts to capture and to quantify all of the individual characteristics that are relevant to determine the progressivity of a life-cycle program like social security.We proceed in seven steps.First, we classify individuals by annual income and use Gini coefficients to find that social security is highly progressive.Second, we reclassify individuals on the basis of lifetime income and find that social security is less progressive.Third, we remove the cap on measured earnings and find that social security is even less progressive.Fourth, we switch from actual to potential lifetime earnings (the present value of the wage rate times 4000 hours each year).This measure captures the value of leisure and home production, so those out of the labor force are less poor, and net payments to them are less progressive.Fifth, we assign to each married individual half of the couple's income.The low-wage spouse is then not so poor, and social security becomes even less progressive.Sixth, we incorporate mortality probabilities that differ by potential lifetime income.Since the rich live longer and collect benefits longer, social security is no longer progressive.Finally, we increase the discount rate from 2% to 4%, which puts relatively more weight on the earlier-but-regressive payroll tax and less weight on the later-butprogressive benefit schedule.The whole social security system is then regressive.",Don Fullerton; Julia Lynn Coronado; Thomas A.

Calculating the redistributive impact of pension systems in Latin America and the Caribbean,"Abstract This paper analyzes implicit subsidies in pension systems across Latin America and the Caribbean. First, we find that pension systems are designed to be progressive by granting a higher replacement rate to low-income workers than high-income workers. However, because all systems subsidize pensions beyond what an actuarially fair system would produce, the absolute subsidies are larger for high-income individuals. Second, using data from Colombia, Chile, El Salvador, Paraguay and Uruguay, we show that, in practice, pension systems tend to be regressive rather than progressive. This is because low-income workers, who contribute intermittently, typically receive no pension as they fail to meet the minimum contribution levels. In some defined benefit systems, 70–95% of subsidies are concentrated in the top three labor income deciles. In defined contribution systems, subsidies are less regressive, but 50–60% still concentrate on high-income deciles. Lastly, non-contributory pensions partially offset the regressivity of pension systems.",Alvaro Altamirano; Mariano Bosch; María Laura Oliveri; Waldo Tapia; Álvaro Altamirano,,,,,,,,,,,,2025.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/ooec/odae030,"Latin Americans, Pension, Economics, Caribbean region, Development economics, Political science, Finance, Law",Inter-American Development Bank,"Inter-American Development Bank , Washington, DC 20577,","Inter-American Development Bank , Washington, DC 20577,"
Differential Mortality and the Value of Individual Account Retirement Annuities,"Abstract This chapter addresses the distributional implications of alternative annuity options within a mandatory retirement savings system. The extent of redistribution depends on how both the accumulation phase and the payout phase are designed. The demographic groups with lower average life expectancies will fare poorly under an annuity rule that dictates the employment of a single annuity conversion factor, or a single price, for all individuals of the same age. Setting a higher assumed interest rate will lead in less redistribution from high mortality rate groups to lower mortality groups. Any pricing scheme that tries to consider mortality heterogeneity by pricing based on group characteristics will make some individuals even worse off. Allowing preretirement bequests may be a significant element in decreasing the extent of regressive redistribution. The degree of dispersion in the MW ratios is very sensitive to the precise structure of the annuity program.",Jeffrey R.

Reforming Social Security with Progressive Personal Accounts,"Abstract This chapter develops yet another approach to Social Security reform. This reform plan is designed to preserve the core objectives of the current Social Security system and, at the same time, gain the benefits of personal accounts. In recent years, the United States has been engaged in a heated debate about whether to replace part of the current, defined benefit (DB) Social Security system with a system of defined contribution (DC) personal accounts. In the current system, the benefits received by Social Security contributors are based on a concave function of lifetime earnings, providing smaller increments in benefits with each additional dollar of lifetime earnings. The importance of making the Social Security system self-balancing by incorporating a market-based aggregate self-correction mechanism is emphasized. The resulting estimates of the ""maximum transition cost"" measure of system obligations are significantly lower than those of the Social Security Administration, due to the incorporation of market risk into the discounting of future benefits. This chapter demonstrates that it is possible to convert Social Security into a system of personal accounts with irrevocable ownership of market priced assets, while at the same time redistributing benefits based on lifetime income and sharing macroeconomic gains across generations.",John Geanakoplos; Stephen P.

Different Approaches to Pension Reform from an Economic Point of View,"Abstract Most social security systems around the world are operated on a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) basis. Taxes collected from working people today are routed directly to pay the benefits of current retirees. Now these systems are faced with rapidly aging populations, increasing the number of retirees relative to the number of persons in the labor force. In addition, employees in most countries are leaving the labor force at younger and younger ages, further increasing the ratio of retirees to employed persons. The combination of these two trends, together with generous retirement benefits in many countries, has placed social security systems around the world under enormous financial stress. This chapter explains the nature of the problem faced by social security systems and then describes the various approaches that might be used to address the problem, commenting on the economic features of each. A commentary and discussion summary are also included at the end of the chapter.",David A.

The Surprising Power of Age-Dependent Taxes,"This paper provides a new, empirically driven application of the dynamic Mirrleesian framework by studying a feasible and potentially powerful tax reform: age-dependent labour income taxation. I show analytically how age dependence improves policy on both the intratemporal and intertemporal margins. I use detailed numerical simulations, calibrated with data from the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics, to generate robust policy implications: age dependence (1) lowers marginal taxes on average and especially on high-income young workers and (2) lowers average taxes on all young workers relative to older workers when private saving and borrowing are restricted. Finally, I calculate and characterize the welfare gains from age dependence. Despite its simplicity, age dependence generates a welfare gain equal to between 0·6% and 1·5% of aggregate annual consumption, and it captures more than 60% of the gain from reform to the dynamic optimal policy. The gains are due to substantial increases in both efficiency and equity. When age dependence is restricted to be Pareto improving, the welfare gain is nearly as large.",Matthew Weinzierl,,,,,,,,,,,,2011.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdr001,"Economics, Welfare, Consumption (sociology), Equity (law), Econometrics, Panel Study of Income Dynamics, Labour economics, Social science, Sociology, Political science, Law, Market economy",Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center,Harvard Business School and NBER,Harvard Business School and NBER
Taxation of Intergenerational Transfers and Wealth,"In this chapter, I review empirical and theoretical literature on taxation of intergenerational transfers (estates, bequests, inheritances, inter vivos gifts) and wealth. The main message may be summarized as follows. Empirical evidence on bequest motivations and responses to estate taxation is spotty and much remains be done, but what we know points in the direction of (1) mixed motives, (2) heterogeneity of preferences, and (3) importance of retaining control over wealth. These patterns are important for normative analysis of taxation toward the top of the distribution. Theoretical work should further focus on understanding implications of inequality of inherited wealth: the topic that has been neglected in the past, even though it is closely related to—more carefully studied, but arguably much less important in practice—externalities from giving. Potential externalities from wealth accumulation and concentration are yet to be seriously addressed.",Wojciech Kopczuk,,,,,,,,,,,,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-444-53759-1.00006-6,"Bequest, Externality, Economics, Estate, Normative, Inequality, Distribution (mathematics), Inheritance (genetic algorithm), Empirical evidence, Distribution of wealth, Wealth distribution, Public economics, Microeconomics, Political science, Mathematical analysis, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Philosophy, Mathematics, Finance, Epistemology, Law, Gene",National Bureau of Economic Research,"Department of Economics and School of International and Public Affairs and National Bureau of Economic Research, Columbia University","Department of Economics and School of International and Public Affairs and National Bureau of Economic Research, Columbia University"

Capital Taxation in the 21st Century,"In his influential book, Capital in the 21st Century, Thomas Piketty argues forcefully that rising wealth and wealth inequality is an inherent characteristic of capitalist economies and calls for strong policy responses, in particular a substantial wealth tax implemented globally.This paper takes issue with the facts, logic, and policy conclusions in Piketty's book, suggesting that the factors needed to support the inexorable rise in capital's share and concentration are lacking and that among tax policy reforms aimed at dealing with economic inequality a wealth tax finds little support either in Piketty's own work or elsewhere in the literature.",Alan Auerbach; Alan J.

Gender differences in business performance: evidence from the Characteristics of Business Owners survey,"Using confidential microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau, we investigate the performance of female-owned businesses, making comparisons to male-owned businesses. Using regression estimates and a decomposition technique, we explore the role that human capital, especially through prior work experience, and financial capital play in contributing to why female-owned businesses have lower survival rates, profits, employment, and sales. We find that female-owned businesses are less successful than male-owned businesses because they have less startup capital, less business human capital acquired through prior work experience in a similar business, and less prior work experience in a family business. We also find some evidence that female business owners work fewer hours and may have different preferences for the goals of their businesses, which may have implications for business outcomes.",Alicia M.

Black and White: Access to Capital Among Minority-Owned Start-ups,"We used confidential and restricted-access data from the Kauffman Firm Survey and matched administrative data on credit scores to explore racial disparities in access to capital for new business ventures. The novel results on racial inequality in start-up financing indicate that Black-owned start-ups start smaller and stay smaller over the entire first eight years of their existence. Black start-ups face more difficulty in raising external capital, especially external debt. We find that disparities in creditworthiness constrain Black entrepreneurs, but perceptions of treatment by banks also hold them back. Black entrepreneurs apply for loans less often than White entrepreneurs largely because they expect to be denied credit, even when they have a good credit history and in settings where strong local banks favor new business development.

Explaining International Differences in Entrepreneurship: The Role of Individual Characteristics and Regulatory Constraints,"We use a micro dataset that collects information across individuals, countries, and time to investigate the determinants of entrepreneurial activity in thirty-seven developed and developing nations.We focus both on individual characteristics and on countries' regulatory differences.We show that individual characteristics, such as gender, age, and status in the workforce are important determinants of entrepreneurship, and we also highlight the relevance of social networks, self-assessed skills, and attitudes toward risk.Moreover, we find that regulation plays a critical role, particularly for those individuals who become entrepreneurs to pursue a business opportunity.The individual characteristics that are impacted most by regulation are those measuring working status, social network, business skills, and attitudes toward risk.",Annamaria Lusardi; Silvia Ardagna,,,,,,,,,,,,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w14012,"Entrepreneurship, Economic geography, Business, Economics, Finance",Harvard University; Individual Differences; European University Institute; Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Department of Economics Harvard University Littauer Center Cambridge, MA 02138; Harvard Business School Morgan, T93 Boston, MA 02163; European University Institute,; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; NBER's International Differences in Entrepreneurship; NBER's International Differences in Entrepreneurship Conference, the; Harvard University; Dartmouth College, Harvard Business School and NBER","Department of Economics Harvard University Littauer Center Cambridge, MA 02138; Harvard Business School Morgan, T93 Boston, MA 02163; European University Institute,; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; NBER's International Differences in Entrepreneurship; NBER's International Differences in Entrepreneurship Conference, the; Harvard University; Dartmouth College, Harvard Business School and NBER"
Age and High-Growth Entrepreneurship,"Many observers, and many investors, believe that young people are especially likely to produce the most successful new firms. Integrating administrative data on firms, workers, and owners, we study start-ups systematically in the United States and find that successful entrepreneurs are middle-aged, not young. The mean age at founding for the 1-in-1,000 fastest growing new ventures is 45.0. The findings are similar when considering high-technology sectors, entrepreneurial hubs, and successful firm exits. Prior experience in the specific industry predicts much greater rates of entrepreneurial success. These findings strongly reject common hypotheses that emphasize youth as a key trait of successful entrepreneurs. (JEL G24, J14, L26, M13, O31)",Benjamin F. Jones; J.

Economic Factors Underlying the Unbundling of Advertising Agency Services,"This paper addresses a longstanding puzzle involving the unbundling of services that has occurred over more than two decades in the U.S. advertising agency industry: How can the shift from the bundling to the unbundling of services be explained and what accounts for the slow pace of change?Using a cost-based theoretical framework of bundling due to Evans and Salinger (2005, 2008), we develop a simple model of an advertising agency's decision to unbundle its services as a tradeoff between the fixed cost to the advertiser of establishing and maintaining a relationship with an advertising agency and pecuniary economies of scale available in providing media services.The results from an econometric analysis of cross-sectional and pooled data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau for quinquennial censuses conducted between 1982 and 2002 support the key predictions of the model.We find that advertising agency establishments are more likely to unbundle if they are large and diversified in their service offerings and are less likely to do so with increasing age and greater geographical scope.We also find a strong trend toward unbundling over time, a result that is partially explained by increases in media prices over time.",Alvin J.

As governments react with swift and severe measures in their ongoing fight to control the pandemic's spread, it is important to understand how these actions may disproportionately increase the risks for women both directly and indirectly with regard to sex and gender.Pregnant women are often among the most vulnerable groups during public health emergencies. In some cases, pregnant women face increased biological susceptibility to adverse health outcomes, as in the case of some respiratory infections. With other emergent coronaviruses, such as those responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), pregnant women who became infected were found to be more likely than nonpregnant women to experience severe complications.2 It is still too early to tell whether this will be the case with COVID-19.In the ongoing pandemic, other factors may have a ripple effect that put women at increased risk even if the disease itself does not. As made clear during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the consequences of large-scale infectious disease outbreaks on uninfected pregnant women can be dire. Routine prenatal care appointments, if not interrupted or discontinued, may put women at increased risk of exposure to the virus. Overwhelmed hospitals struggling to function with staff and supply shortages may not be able to provide the high quality of care that all pregnant women and their newborns deserve, let alone respond to emergency obstetric complications. Furthermore, there is also a risk that life-saving treatments or vaccines will be denied to pregnant women over concern for fetal safety or a lack of data.3,4The fear of infection, concern for the well-being of friends and loved ones, uncertainty, disruption, and social isolation that have become part and parcel of daily life for many around the world will undoubtedly have profound effects on mental health on the population at large, but being pregnant during a global pandemic is likely to be even more frightening for many women. Although containment strategies, such as those that require women to deliver without a companion present, including partners and doulas, that have already been put into place in some cities in the United States,5 or those that separate newborns from their mothers immediately after birth if the mother is infected with COVID-196 may be clinically important to reduce transmission, they may also have profound short- and long-term mental health implications for women. Among women who have young children, previous research in Ethiopia, India, and Vietnam found that women who experience family-related stressful life events, such as illness or death within the household and financial uncertainty, are more likely to experience episodes of severe mental distress.7 With the ongoing need to social distance, family and community networks may struggle and pregnant and postpartum women may feel even more vulnerable and isolated over a lack of social support.The adverse effects of the pandemic in relation to women's reproductive health are not limited to pregnancy or motherhood. As movement restrictions are put into place, supply chains are disrupted, and businesses are shuttered, some women may be at increased risk of unintended pregnancy should it become difficult to obtain their regular contraceptive method or emergency contraceptives, if needed. Furthermore, some states within the United States have begun to impose restrictions on certain medical procedures that they deem to be elective, including abortion, suggesting they must be delayed until after the pandemic is over.8 Spikes in domestic violence during times of crisis are another area of grave concern for women's health, and as governments continue to put into place more extreme measures to enforce social distancing, for some women, more time at home may mean more time spent with an abusive partner. Fewer social interactions may also mean less accountability for perpetrators and fewer opportunities for others to intervene.Gender-related factors may also increase the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women globally. Women constitute a disproportionately high percentage of caregivers in both the formal and informal sectors.9 A large proportion of frontline health care professionals (nurses, community health workers, health technicians, etc.) is women who face a higher risk of infection, morbidity, and death as a result of their profession.9 At the same time, women more frequently serve as the primary caregivers within a household, which may further increase their risk of exposure. In the United States, 65% of unpaid family caregivers are estimated to be women and 80% of them care for someone aged 50 years or older.10 Outside of their caregiving role, women are overrepresented in the informal employment sector. In low-and middle-income countries, two-thirds of women who work do so as part of the informal economy with limited access to health care for themselves and their families.9 Containment and mitigation policies that limit women's ability to perform their duties without offering effective alternatives, such as closing of daycare facilities for their children or not providing paid sick leave, may result in unnecessary exposure to disease and increased family vulnerability.It is urgent that we adopt a gender lens to study the pandemic and its effects, including the policies and actions that are put into place at the global, country, and local levels. This may be especially important in disadvantaged populations and resource-poor communities, where women are especially vulnerable. The public health community must ensure that existing health and social services meant to support women in the face of their unique needs do not disappear in lieu of the all-encompassing focus on stopping the pandemic. Furthermore, we argue that special attention needs to be paid to ensure that informal caregivers are supported, informed, and protected. To avoid making existing gender disparities larger as a result of the pandemic, a special body at the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention is urgently needed to track sex disaggregated data and analyze policies related to COVID-19 using a gender lens.Author Disclosure StatementNo competing financial interests exist.Funding InformationNo funding was received for this article.References1.

The Economics of Density: Evidence From the Berlin Wall,"This paper develops a quantitative model of internal city structure that features agglomeration and dispersion forces and an arbitrary number of heterogeneous city blocks.The model remains tractable and amenable to empirical analysis because of stochastic shocks to commuting decisions, which yield a gravity equation for commuting ows.To structurally estimate agglomeration and dispersion forces, we use data on thousands of city blocks in Berlin for 1936, 1986 and 2006 and exogenous variation from the city's division and reuni cation.We estimate substantial and highly localized production and residential externalities.We show that the model with the estimated agglomeration parameters can account both qualitatively and quantitatively for the observed changes in city structure.We show how our quantitative framework can be used to undertake counterfactuals for changes in the organization of economic activity within cities in response for example to changes in the transport network.",Daniel M.

"People, Places, and Public Policy: Some Simple Welfare Economics of Local Economic Development Programs","Most countries exhibit large and persistent geographical differences in wages, income, and unemployment rates. A growing class of place-based policies attempts to address these differences through public investments and subsidies that target disadvantaged neighborhoods, cities, or regions. Place-based policies have the potential to profoundly affect the location of economic activity, along with the wages, employment, and industry mix of communities. These programs are widespread in the United States and throughout the world but have only recently been studied closely by economists. We consider the following questions: Who benefits from place-based interventions? Do the national benefits outweigh the costs? What sorts of interventions are most likely to be effective? To study these questions, we develop a simple spatial equilibrium model designed to characterize the welfare effects of place-based policies on the local and the national economy. Using this model, we critically evaluate the economic rationales for place-based policies and assess the latest evidence on their effects. We conclude with some lessons for policy and directions for future research.",Enrico Moretti; Patrick Kline,,,,,,,,,,,,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-economics-080213-041024,"Disadvantaged, Economics, Subsidy, Public economics, Welfare, Unemployment, Public policy, Psychological intervention, Spatial mismatch, Economic growth, Market economy, Psychology, Psychiatry","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Berkeley","National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138; Department of Economics, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720;","National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138; Department of Economics, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720;"
A Spatial Knowledge Economy,"Leading empiricists and theorists of cities have recently argued that the generation and exchange of ideas must play a more central role in the analysis of cities. This paper develops the first system of cities model with costly idea exchange as the agglomeration force. The model replicates a broad set of established facts about the cross section of cities. It provides the first spatial equilibrium theory of why skill premia are higher in larger cities and how variation in these premia emerges from symmetric fundamentals.

BIG DATA AND BIG CITIES: THE PROMISES AND LIMITATIONS OF IMPROVED MEASURES OF URBAN LIFE,"New, “big data” sources allow measurement of city characteristics and outcome variables at higher collection frequencies and more granular geographic scales than ever before. However, big data will not solve large urban social science questions on its own. Big urban data has the most value for the study of cities when it allows measurement of the previously opaque, or when it can be coupled with exogenous shocks to people or place. We describe a number of new urban data sources and illustrate how they can be used to improve the study and function of cities. We first show how Google Street View images can be used to predict income in New York City, suggesting that similar imagery data can be used to map wealth and poverty in previously unmeasured areas of the developing world. We then discuss how survey techniques can be improved to better measure willingness to pay for urban amenities. Finally, we explain how Internet data is being used to improve the quality of city services. ( JEL R1, C8, C18)",Edward L.

Using a rich set of German linked employer-employee panel data we follow over time plants that start to export. We show that the exporter wage premium does already exist in the years before firms start to export, and that it does not increase in the following years.

Product Market Synergies and Competition in Mergers and Acquisitions: A Text-Based Analysis,"We examine how product differentiation influences mergers and acquisitions and the ability of firms to exploit product market synergies.Using novel text-based analysis of firm 10K product descriptions, we find three key results.(1) Firms are more likely to enter restructuring transactions when the language describing their assets is similar to all other firms, consistent with their assets being more redeployable.(2) Targets earn lower announcement returns when similar alternative target firms exist.(3) Acquiring firms in competitive product markets experience increased profitability, higher sales growth, and increased changes in their product descriptions when they buy target firms that are similar to them and different from rival firms.Our findings are consistent with similar merging firms exploiting synergies to create new products and increase their product differentiation relative to ex-ante rivals.",Gerard Hoberg; Gordon Phillips,,,,,,,,,,,,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhq053,"Mergers and acquisitions, Competition (biology), Industrial organization, Business, Product (mathematics), Product market, Economics, Microeconomics, Finance, Mathematics, Ecology, Geometry, Biology, Incentive","Duke University; University of Maryland, College Park; The Ohio State University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Citigroup; University of Southern California","School of Business University of Southern California Citigroup Center Los Angeles, CA 90089 and NBER; Duke University, Ohio State University,; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; School of Business University of Maryland 4423 Van Munching Hall College Park, MD 20742","School of Business University of Southern California Citigroup Center Los Angeles, CA 90089 and NBER; Duke University, Ohio State University,; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; School of Business University of Maryland 4423 Van Munching Hall College Park, MD 20742"
Corporate Innovations and Mergers and Acquisitions,"ABSTRACT Using a large and unique patent‐merger data set over the period 1984 to 2006, we show that companies with large patent portfolios and low R&amp;D expenses are acquirers, while companies with high R&amp;D expenses and slow growth in patent output are targets. Further, technological overlap between firm pairs has a positive effect on transaction incidence, and this effect is reduced for firm pairs that overlap in product markets. We also show that acquirers with prior technological linkage to their target firms produce more patents afterwards. We conclude that synergies obtained from combining innovation capabilities are important drivers of acquisitions.",JAN BENA; Jan Bena; KAI LI; Kai Li,,,,,,,,,,,,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.12059,"Linkage (software), Business, Database transaction, Industrial organization, Mergers and acquisitions, Monetary economics, Economics, Finance, Database, Computer science, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Gene",Chinese University of Hong Kong; Federal Reserve Board of Governors,"Jan Bena and Kai Li are at the Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia.

Do Acquisitions Relieve Target Firms’ Financial Constraints?,"ABSTRACT Managers often claim that target firms are financially constrained prior to being acquired and that these constraints are eased following the acquisition. Using a large sample of European acquisitions, we document that the level of cash that target firms hold, the sensitivity of cash to cash flow, and the sensitivity of investment to cash flow all decline, while investment increases following the acquisition. These effects are stronger in deals that are more likely to be associated with financing improvements. Our findings suggest that acquisitions relieve financial frictions in target firms, especially when the target firm is relatively small.",ISIL EREL; Isil Erel; MICHAEL S. WEISBACH; Michael S.

Innovation Activities and Integration through Vertical Acquisitions,"Abstract We examine the determinants of vertical acquisitions using product text linked to product vocabulary from input-output tables. We find that the innovation stage is important in understanding vertical integration. R&amp;D-intensive firms are less likely to become targets of vertical acquisitions. In contrast, firms with patented innovation are more likely to sell to vertically related buyers. Firms’ R&amp;D intensity is a more important deterrent to their vertical acquisitions when the provision of innovation incentives by potential acquirers is more difficult. The role of patents in fostering vertical acquisitions is more prevalent when potential buyers face a higher risk of holdup.

"Conglomerate Firms, Internal Capital Markets, and the Theory of the Firm","This article reviews the conglomerate literature, with a focus on recent papers that have cast strong doubt on the hypothesis that conglomerate firms destroy value on average when compared to similar stand-alone firms. Recent work has shown that investment decisions by conglomerate firms are consistent with value maximization; conglomerate firms trade at an average premium relative to single-segment firms when value weighting; and the valuation premia and discounts, both for conglomerates and single-segment firms, are driven by differences in the production of unique differentiated products.

"Corporate Acquisitions, Diversification, and the Firm’s Lifecycle","Theories of corporate finance predict that young firms make acquisitions to exploit growth opportunities, while mature firms do so because they lack growth opportunities. Further, mature firms are more likely to make wealth-destroying diversifying acquisitions because of agency problems. Contrary to these theories, we find that, while across IPO cohorts young and mature firms acquire more than middle-aged firms, young and mature firms acquire for similar reasons. Firms with better growth opportunities and performance are more likely to make acquisitions irrespective of their lifecycle stage. Moreover, both young and mature firms have similar propensities to make diversifying acquisitions. The market’s reaction to acquisition announcements enables us to reject the hypothesis that managers of mature firms are more likely to make value-destroying acquisitions than managers of young firms.",Asli M.

The Anthropocene: conceptual and historical perspectives,"The human imprint on the global environment has now become so large and active that it rivals some of the great forces of Nature in its impact on the functioning of the Earth system. Although global-scale human influence on the environment has been recognized since the 1800s, the term Anthropocene, introduced about a decade ago, has only recently become widely, but informally, used in the global change research community. However, the term has yet to be accepted formally as a new geological epoch or era in Earth history. In this paper, we put forward the case for formally recognizing the Anthropocene as a new epoch in Earth history, arguing that the advent of the Industrial Revolution around 1800 provides a logical start date for the new epoch. We then explore recent trends in the evolution of the Anthropocene as humanity proceeds into the twenty-first century, focusing on the profound changes to our relationship with the rest of the living world and on early attempts and proposals for managing our relationship with the large geophysical cycles that drive the Earth's climate system.",Jacques Grinevald; John McNeill; Paul Crutzen; Paul J.

Identifying Technology Spillovers and Product Market Rivalry,"The impact of R&D on growth through spillovers has been a major topic of economic research over the last thirty years. A central problem in the literature is that firm performance is affected by two countervailing ""spillovers"" : a positive effect from technology (knowledge) spillovers and a negative business stealing effects from product market rivals. We develop a general framework incorporating these two types of spillovers and implement this model using measures of a firm's position in technology space and productmarket space. Using panel data on U.S. firms, we show that technology spillovers quantitatively dominate, so that the gross social returns to R&D are at least twice as high as the private returns. We identify the causal effect of R&D spillovers by using changes in federal and state tax incentives for R&D. We also find that smaller firms generate lower social returns to R&D because they operate more in technological niches. Finally, we detail the desirable properties of an ideal spillover measure and how existing approaches, including our new Mahalanobis measure, compare to these criteria.",John Van Reenen; Mark A.

Can Innovation Help U.S. Manufacturing Firms Escape Import Competition from China?,"ABSTRACT We study whether R&amp;D‐intensive firms are more resilient to trade shocks. We correct for the endogeneity of R&amp;D using tax‐induced changes to R&amp;D costs. While rising imports from China lead to slower sales growth and lower profitability, these effects are significantly smaller for firms with a larger stock of R&amp;D (about half when moving from the bottom quartile to the top quartile of R&amp;D). We provide evidence that this effect is explained by R&amp;D allowing firms to increase product differentiation. As a result, while firms in import‐competing industries cut capital expenditures and employment, R&amp;D‐intensive firms downsize considerably less.",ADRIEN MATRAY; Adrien Matray; JOHAN HOMBERT; Johan Hombert,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.12691,"Profitability index, China, Quartile, Monetary economics, Endogeneity, Competition (biology), Stock (firearms), Business, Economics, Econometrics, Finance, Internal medicine, Mechanical engineering, Confidence interval, Ecology, Political science, Law, Biology, Engineering, Medicine",Princeton University; HEC Paris; Center for Economic and Policy Research; Connecting to Care; HEC Paris in Qatar; Ghent University; The Econometric Society; Copenhagen Business School,"Rich Mathews; Stefan Zeume; conference participants at the Labex Ecodec Workshop at HEC Paris, the London Business School 2015 Summer Finance Symposium, the 2015 Western Finance Association meeting, the 2015 Workshop on Entrepreneurial Finance and Innovation Around the World, the 2015 Workshop on the Economics of Corporate Ownership, the European Summer Symposium in Financial Markets (Gerzensee) 2015, the 2015 Econometric Society World Meeting, and the 2016 NBER Productivity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship.

Identifying the Valuation Effects and Agency Costs of Corporate Diversification: Evidence from the Geographic Diversification of U.S. Banks,"This paper assesses the impact of the geographic diversification of bank holding company (BHC) assets across the United States on their market valuations. Using two new identification strategies based on the dynamic process of interstate bank deregulation, we find that exogenous increases in geographic diversity reduced BHC valuations. We also find that the geographic diversification of BHC assets increased insider lending and reduced loan quality. Taken together, these findings are consistent with theories predicting that geographic diversity intensifies agency problems.",Luc Laeven; Martin Goetz; Martin R.

The Lancet Nigeria Commission: investing in health and the future of the nation,"Health is central to the development of any country. Nigeria's gross domestic product is the largest in Africa, but its per capita income of about ₦770 000 (US$2000) is low with a highly inequitable distribution of income, wealth, and therefore, health. It is a picture of poverty amidst plenty. Nigeria is both a wealthy country and a very poor one. About 40% of Nigerians live in poverty, in social conditions that create ill health, and with the ever-present risk of catastrophic expenditures from high out-of-pocket spending for health. Even compared with countries of similar income levels in Africa, Nigeria's population health outcomes are poor, with national statistics masking drastic differences between rich and poor, urban and rural populations, and different regions. Nigeria also holds great promise. It is Africa's most populous country with 206 million people and immense human talent; it has a diaspora spanning the globe, 374 ethnic groups and languages, and a decentralised federal system of governance as enshrined in its 1999 Constitution. In this Commission, we present a positive outlook that is both possible and necessary for Nigeria to deliver equitable and optimal health outcomes. If the country confronts its toughest challenges—a complex political structure, weak governance, poor accountability, inefficiency, and corruption—it has the potential to vastly improve population health using a multisector, whole-of-government approach. Major obstacles include ineffective use of available resources, a dearth of robust population-level health and mortality data, insufficient financing for health and health care, sub-optimal deployment of available health funding to purchase health services, and large population inequities. Nigeria's demographic dividend has unguaranteed potential, with a high dependency ratio, a fast-growing population, and slow reduction in child mortality. Effective, quality reproductive, maternal, and child health services including family planning, and female education and empowerment are likely to accelerate demographic transition and yield a demographic dividend. This Commission was written in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has laid bare the inability of the public health system to confront new pathogens with threats to human health. However, despite a history of weak surveillance and diagnostic infrastructure, the scale up of COVID-19 diagnostics suggests that it is possible to rapidly improve other areas with sufficient local effort and resources. The Lancet Nigeria Commission aims to reposition future health policy in Nigeria to achieve universal health coverage and better health for all. This Commission presents analysis and evidence to support a positive and realistic future for Nigeria. The Commission addresses historically intractable challenges with a new narrative. Nigeria's path to greater prosperity lies through investment in the social determinants of health and the health system. Nigeria is not making use of its most precious resource—its people—by not adequately enacting policies to address preventable health problems. Health is influenced by access to quality health services, but other influencing factors lie outside this sphere. Huge gains in health can and must be made by ensuring adequate sanitation and hygiene, access to clean water, and food security, especially for children, and by addressing environmental threats to health, including air pollution. Nigeria has a young population, yet, despite spending more on health than many countries in west Africa (mostly from out-of-pocket payment), Nigerians have a lower life expectancy (54 years) than many of their neighbours. Nigeria's lower life expectancy is partially due to having more deaths in children of 5 years and younger than any other country in the world, including more populous India and China and countries experiencing widespread long-term conflict, such as Somalia. Chronic diseases and a high infectious disease burden, and an ever-present risk of epidemics of Lassa fever, meningitis, and cholera, present additional challenges. A rising population and inadequate infrastructure development over the past 30 years have contributed to increasing deaths from trauma through road injuries and conflicts driven by inequitable distribution of resources. Addressing Nigeria's health challenges requires a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to prevent ill health. This means investing in highly cost-effective health-promoting policies and interventions, which have extremely high cost–benefit ratios, and offering clear political benefits for implementation. Interventions are needed to improve child nutrition, reduce indoor and outdoor air pollution, address unmet family planning needs, and improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Key messages•We call for a new social contract centred on health to address Nigeria's need to define the relationship between the citizen and the state. Health is a unique political lever, which to date has been under-utilised as a mechanism to rally populations. Good health can be at the core of the rebirth of a patriotic national identity and sense of belonging. A commitment to a ""One Nation, One Health"" policy would prioritise the attainment of Universal Health Coverage for the most vulnerable subpopulations, who also bear the highest disease burden.•We recommend that prevention should be at the heart of health policy given Nigeria's young population. This will require a whole-of-government approach and community engagement. An explicit consideration of equity in the implementation of programmes and provision of social welfare, education and employment opportunities should be paramount.•We propose an ambitious programme of healthcare reform to deliver a centrally determined, locally delivered health system. The goal of government should be to provide health insurance coverage for 83 million poor Nigerians who cannot afford to pay premiums. Implementation of a reinvigorated National Strategic Health Development Plan (NSHDP III) should be supported by structured and explicit approaches to ensure that Federal, State and Local Governments deliver and are held accountable for non-delivery. NSHDP III should be supported by a ring-fenced budget and have a longer horizon of at least a decade during which common rules should apply to all parts of the system.•At the same time, the system should encourage innovation. Future health system reform should engage communities to ensure that existing nationally driven schemes have local buy-in and are sustainable. Further, since more than 50% of health services are provided in the private sector, often with poor quality and high costs, reforming the policy and regulatory landscape to unleash the market potential of the private sector is important.•We outline options for improving health financing and ensuring better accountability and distribution of resources. The rationalised governance schemes we have proposed should improve the efficient use of existing resources devoted to health. Ultimately, the proportion of spending allocated to health needs to be increased. We envision a future of Nigeria's health without foreign aid. This will require substantial increase in domestic investments. Foreign aid (multilateral, bilateral, and philanthropic) has led to fragmentation of the already complex health development landscape, with huge asymmetries in legitimacy between foreign actors and the Nigerian state as well as weak accountability. Defragmenting and decolonizing the Nigerian health landscape requires domesticating health financing.•We recommend a whole system assessment of the invest-ment needs in Nigeria's health security. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of Nigeria's health security system. Nigeria needs better manufacturing capacity for essential health products, medicines and vaccines, the provision of diagnostics, surveillance and preventive public health measures in health facilities and community settings, as well as other preventive and curative measures.•We call on the Federal Government, working with state governments, to fund and lead the development of standards for the digitisation of health records and better data collection, registration and quality assurance systems. A National Medical Research Council with 2% of the health budget and central government funding to award competitive peer reviewed grants will support high quality evidence and innovation. •We call for a new social contract centred on health to address Nigeria's need to define the relationship between the citizen and the state.

A National Medical Research Council with 2% of the health budget and central government funding to award competitive peer reviewed grants will support high quality evidence and innovation. We call for the thoughtful use of existing institutions as an approach to achieve better governance and prioritisation of health. Although corruption has undermined the Nigerian health system, we can harness existing institutions for the benefit of population health. All levels of Government in Nigeria (federal, state, and local), and traditional leadership structures, civil society, the private sector, religious organisations, and communities, influence health. Efforts towards a balance between centralisation and localisation should focus on common policies, standards, and accountability. Concurrently, there is an equal need for localisation of implementation, meaning actual community and local government ownership of health service delivery. All three levels of Government are crucial, and we provide recommendations for each level. Differences in regional needs and context must also dictate programmes and interventions. What is needed in the northeast, in a context of ongoing insecurity and a crisis of internally displaced persons, is quite different from needs in wealthier, more secure urban centres, or in the face of the different level of insecurity found in oil-producing areas in the Niger Delta. Prioritisation of health requires additional funds. We have provided a clear investment case on health to convince politicians and governments that improved population health will reap political, demographic, and economic dividends. Our call for a whole-of-government approach to health will allow the delivery of multisectoral policies to address the social determinants of health, prioritise health-care expenditure to major causes of burden of diseases, and substantially increase healthy and productive lifespans. Nigeria's health system was built in an ad hoc way, layering traditional community health systems with colonial medicine aimed at maximising resource extraction. This origin has resulted in inbuilt inequalities, a dysfunctional focus on curative care, and a detrimental social distance from users and communities. Post-independence policies to redress problems have only been partially implemented. However, the current health system is sprawling, multifarious, disintegrated, and frequently inaccessible, with very minimal financial risk protection and low financial accessibility of services. Nigerians variously seek care from medical personnel and auxiliaries, community health workers, medicine vendors, marabouts and spiritual healers, traditional birth attendants, and other informal providers. The system relies on a mixture of quasi-tax-funding, fee-for-service, and minimal health insurance coverage. What kind of health system do Nigerians deserve, and should the country's leaders work towards? The core need of most Nigerians today is for accessible basic health services, and for this to be achieved, improvements in public sector delivery supported by an enhanced complementary private sector, including faith-based organisations, is the way forward. We lay out a path for Nigeria to move towards a system that, although remaining diverse, better serves the needs of the population. Within this diversity, we believe there is an opportunity for a ""one nation and one health"" approach, whereby Nigeria guarantees a minimum standard and delivery of health care for all with an emphasis on strengthening public and private (including faith-based and non-profit) systems. Nigeria should also leverage the private sector for certain functions, such as expanding innovation, discovery, and manufacturing capacities to claim a leadership role on the African continent and globally. Government investment in private industry should be mission-driven, supporting innovation and claiming dividends for society from its investments. Core functions of the health system require immediate attention, in particular, good quality health data. This Commission strongly recommends better recording, storage, and use of data. Paper systems are unworkable. A drive towards digitisation can result in major improvements, for both patient care and devolved health decision-making. Mobile digital technologies should allow a relatively rapid expansion of population health data and linked existing datasets. Human resources in rural and poor regions of the country are worsened by brain drain. We propose prioritising the optimal development and redistribution of health workers at all levels. A viable health system requires dedicated, efficient, and equitable health financing mechanisms, complemented by optional health insurance. Countries with systems comparable with Nigeria's, such as Ethiopia and Indonesia, have planned or implemented ambitious programmes to deliver health insurance coverage.",Adebowale Adeyemo; Adesola Yinka-Ogunleye; Afolabi Olaniyi Ogunlesi; Aishatu L.

"The state of diabetes treatment coverage in 55 low-income and middle-income countries: a cross-sectional study of nationally representative, individual-level data in 680 102 adults","Approximately 80% of the 463 million adults worldwide with diabetes live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). A major obstacle to designing evidence-based policies to improve diabetes outcomes in LMICs is the limited nationally representative data on the current patterns of treatment coverage. The objectives of this study are (1) to estimate the proportion of adults with diabetes in LMICs who receive coverage of recommended pharmacological and non-pharmacological diabetes treatment and (2) to describe country-level and individual-level characteristics that are associated with treatment.We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of pooled, individual data from 55 nationally representative surveys in LMICs. Our primary outcome of self-reported diabetes treatment coverage was based upon population-level monitoring indicators recommended in the 2020 World Health Organization Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions. We assessed coverage of three pharmacological and three non-pharmacological treatments among people with diabetes. At the country level, we estimated the proportion of individuals reporting coverage by per-capita gross national income and geographic region. At the individual level, we used logistic regression models to assess coverage along several key individual characteristics including sex, age, BMI, wealth quintile, and educational attainment. In the primary analysis, we scaled sample weights such that countries were weighted equally.The final pooled sample from the 55 LMICs included 680,102 total individuals and 37,094 individuals with diabetes. Using equal weights for each country, diabetes prevalence was 9.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.7-9.4), with 43.9% (95% CI, 41.9-45.9) reporting a prior diabetes diagnosis. Overall, 4.6% (95% CI, 3.9-5.4) of individuals with diabetes self-reported meeting need for all treatments recommended for them. Coverage of glucose-lowering medication was 50.5% (95% CI, 48.6-52.5); antihypertensive medication, 41.3% (95% CI, 39.3-43.3); cholesterol-lowering medication, 6.3% (95% CI, 5.5-7.2); diet counseling, 32.2% (95% CI, 30.7-33.7); exercise counseling, 28.2% (95% CI, 26.6-29.8); and weight-loss counseling, 31.5% (95% CI, 29.3-33.7). Countries at higher income levels tended to have greater coverage. Female sex and higher age, BMI, educational attainment, and household wealth were also associated with greater coverage.Fewer than one in ten people with diabetes in LMICs receive coverage of guideline-based comprehensive diabetes treatment. Scaling-up the capacity of health systems to deliver treatment not only to lower glucose but also to address cardiovascular disease risk factors such as hypertension and high cholesterol are urgent global diabetes priorities.",Bahendeka K Silver; Bolormaa Norov; Corine Houehanou; Corine Houéhanou; David Flood; David Guwatudde; Deborah J Wexler; Deborah J.

Health-Related Research Using Confidential U.S. Census Bureau Data,"Economic studies on health-related issues have the potential to benefit all Americans. The approaches for dealing with the growth of health care costs and health insurance coverage are ever changing and information is needed on their efficacy. Research on health-related topics has been conducted for about a decade at the Census Bureau’s Center for Economic Studies and the Research Data Centers. This paper begins by describing the confidential business and demographic Census Bureau data products used in this research. The discussion continues with summaries of nearly 30 papers, including how this work has benefited the Census Bureau and its research findings. Some focus on data linkages and assessing data quality, while others address important questions in the employer, public, and individual insurance markets. This research could not have been accomplished with public-use data. The newly available data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and National Center for Health Statistics, as well as additional Census Bureau data now available in the Research Data Centers are also discussed.",Alice M.

The Effect of Medicaid Expansions in the Late 1980s and Early 1990s on the Labor Supply of Pregnant Women,"A substantial body of research has found that expansions in Medicaid eligibility increased enrollment in Medicaid, reduced the rate of uninsured, and reduced the rate of private health insurance coverage (i.e., crowd-out). Notably, no published research has examined the labor supply mechanism by which crowd-out could occur. This study examines the effects of expansions in Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women in the late 1980s and the early 1990s on labor supply, which is one of the possible mechanisms underlying crowd-out. Estimates suggest that the 20 percentage point increase in Medicaid eligibility during the sample period was associated with an 11–13 percent decrease in the probability that a woman who gave birth in the past year was employed. Among unmarried women with less than a high school education, the change in Medicaid eligibility reduced employment by approximately 13 percent to 16 percent. We find that most of this reduction in labor supply was associated with crowd-out (i.e., movement from private to public insurance concurrent with the shift in labor supply).",Dhaval Dave; Kosali I.

The Cyclical Behavior of the Price-Cost Markup,"A countercyclical markup of price over marginal cost is the key transmission mechanism for demand shocks in textbook New Keynesian (NK) models.This paper re-examines the foundation of those models.We study the cyclicality of markups in the private economy as well as in detailed manufacturing industries.First, we show that frameworks for measuring markups that have produced the strongest evidence for countercyclicality produce the opposite result when we substitute new methods and data.Second, because the NK model's predictions differ by the nature of the shock, we present evidence on the cyclicality of the markup conditional on various types of shocks.Consistent with the NK model, we find that markups are procyclical conditional on a technology shock.However, we find that they are either procyclical or acyclical conditional on demand shocks.Thus, the textbook NK explanation for the effects of government spending or monetary policy is not supported by the behavior of the markup.",Christopher J.

Firm Organization in the Digital Age: IT Use and Vertical Transactions in U.S. Manufacturing,"We investigate whether the organizational design of manufacturing production is sensitive to important advances in information technology (IT) – and under what conditions. Using U.S. Census Bureau data for over 5,600 plants from 1992 to 2002, we observe both specific uses of IT and whether plants outsource downstream value-chain activities or keep them within the firm. Taking advantage of the sudden introduction of the commercial internet in the mid-1990s and within-plant changes over this period, we find that externally-focused coordination over the internet was associated with a significant net shift towards market-based exchange. The magnitude of the response depends, however, on the pre-existing organization of internal production processes – which varies widely not only across, but also within firms. Moreover, the effects vary by the particular application(s) of general-purpose internet technology. By studying vertical integration at the level of transaction flows and considering important features of how production is organized inside firms, we surface new facets of the relationship between IT and firm organization in an increasingly digital age.",Chris Forman; Kristina McElheran,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3396116,"Business, Industrial organization, Operations management, Engineering",Center for Strategic Research; Cornell University; University of Toronto,Cornell University - Charles H.

IntroductionA leading proximate explanation for plunging employment during the Great Recession is plummeting demand for goods. According to this Keynesian labor demand hypothesis, when producers face unexpectedly low demand for their goods they respond by laying off workers rather than lowering their output prices. The underlying source of Keynesian labor demand could be nominal price stickiness and/or countercyclical desired markups. See Keynes (1939) for his embrace of both justifications.1We test for Keynesian labor demand across US industries in recent decades (1990 to 2011). To do so, we exploit how durability varies across seventy consumption and investment categories to predict relative goods demand movements over the business cycle. Relative demand shocks allow us to test whether markups move in the direction predicted by Keynesian labor demand.2 We also exploit information on which goods are luxuries versus necessities to predict relative demand, and take into account how price flexibility and capital-intensity of production vary across industries.According to consumer theory, durability should be a powerful determinant of the cyclical expenditures on a good. The more durable a good, the smaller is the average flow of expenditures on the good relative to the accumulated stock. For a good that lasts N years, increasing the stock by 1 percent requires an N percent increase in expenditures on the good relative to replacement expenditures. Thus any common macro shock (such as to technology or monetary policy) should hit demand for durables more dramatically. Similarly, demand for luxuries should be more cyclical than demand for necessities.Under sticky prices, firms should accommodate shifts in relative demand by firing or hiring workers rather than adjusting their prices. If capital is less flexible than labor in the short run, firms in flexible-price industries should adjust their prices more and adjust their production less than do sticky-price industries—controlling for the size of the demand shift they face. If target markups are countercyclical, however, then price stickiness may not be essential for a Keynesian labor demand response to goods demand shocks.We test for Keynesian labor demand using a variety of data. We use US National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) and insurance industry estimates of durability for seventy goods covering around 60 percent of GDP. These include most consumer and investment goods and services, but exclude government purchases and housing consumption. We estimate whether a good is a luxury or a necessity using cross-sectional Engel curves from the US Consumer Expenditure Survey. We assess price flexibility using US Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) microdata on the frequency of price changes by good.We use quarterly NIPA data on consumption and investment from 1990 to 2011 to test whether durability and luxuriousness succeed in predicting the cyclicality of expenditures. Durability is a strong predictor. Bringing in data from the US Current Employment Survey, we find that durability is also highly correlated with employment growth across industries—including during the Great Recession. Finally, we incorporate the US Bureau of Labor Statistics KLEMS data on production, prices, and inputs across detailed industries. This allows us to contrast movements in labor’s productivity with its real wage, identifying whether producers move away from constant-markup labor demand in response to goods demand shocks.We find that industries producing goods that are more durable, while displaying much more cyclical employment and output, exhibit countercyclical relative markups. This countercyclical increase in markups is sufficiently large that relative prices of durables do not fall in recessions. (By contrast, sectoral total factor productivity [TFP] movements play little role in explaining the lack of cyclicality in durables’ relative prices.) Our evidence rejects flexible-price labor demand under a constant markup, but is consistent with Keynesian labor demand. This cyclical pricing for durables could reflect intentional markup movements, rather than being the byproduct of price stickiness. In fact, a model with countercyclical intended markups for durables, but flexible pricing in general, would arguably explain the data better than a sticky-price model.Despite its prominence in business cycle theorizing, there have been surprisingly few tests for Keynesian labor demand. Most have been based on aggregate time series, such as Galí and Rabanal (2004) and Basu, Fernald, and Kimball (2006). More recently, a number of studies have exploited regional variation to test whether goods demand drives employment. Examples include Feyrer and Sacerdote (2011), Nakamura and Steinsson (2011), and Mian and Sufi(2012). Mulligan (2010) looks at seasonal movements in labor supply and employment. Our study complements these by looking at cross-industry evidence. Thus, our approach is similar to Shea (1993) and Nekarda and Ramey (2011), who examine the impact of an industry’s downstream demand (Shea) and its share of government purchases (Nekarda and Ramey) on industry price and quantity. Chang, Hornstein, and Sarte (2009) examine how employment responds to industry-specific productivity shocks, and how that response depends on the use of inventories and pricing frequency in the industry.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section II, we lay out a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to illustrate the key forces that motivate our demand predictors. Section III briefly describes the data sets we use. Section IV presents the main results, and section V concludes.II. ModelIn this section we use a multisector DSGE model to demonstrate how relative demand shocks affect markups under Keynesian versus classical labor demand. Here the source of Keynesian labor demand is sticky prices, rather than countercyclical intended markups. We incorporate heterogeneity in the durability of goods, the capital intensity of firms’ production, and the frequency of price changes. After sketching the key model features, we use a simplified version of the model to illustrate analytically how movements in relative quantities and prices across sectors differ depending on whether the model is Keynesian or classical (i.e., sticky or flexible prices).3 We then calibrate and simulate the full-blown model to get some quantitative sense of these movements.A. FirmsDurable (Yd) and nondurable (Yn) final goods are produced from intermediate goods, which are produced by two types of firms: those with high- and low-capital-intensity technologies. Competitive final goods producers use the following production functionwhere Yjf,t are composite intermediate goods produced (by competitive firms) according towhere ε > 1. Individual intermediate goods producers are monopolistically competitive and produce using a constant returns to scale (CRS) production functionwhere kjf,t(l) and njf,t(l) are capital and labor services employed by firm l in sector jf at time t, Ajf,t is sector-specific TFP, j = {d,n} indexes the type of good produced, and f = {h,l} denotes the technology used. Sectoral price indices, Pj,t and Pjf,t, expressed as functions of individual prices pjf,t(l), can be derived via standard cost minimization.Capital and labor flow freely between firms in the same sector, which implies, under CRS production, that nominal marginal costs and capital-labor ratios will be equated across firms in the same sector. However, as will become clear when we discuss household supply of factor inputs, imperfect capital mobility will allow marginal costs to vary across sectors. Furthermore, different production technologies across sectors imply different slopes for sectoral marginal cost curves. In particular, firms that produce with more capital-intensive technologies (larger αf) will require a greater increase in the flexible labor factor to effect a given short-run increase in production (i.e., their marginal cost curves are steeper).Finally, goods prices are sticky. We use the Calvo (1983) assumption whereby monopolistically competitive firms change their prices with a constant probability of (1 – θif). We allow θjf to vary by sector, and will also consider perfect price flexibility (θjf = 0, ∀jf ).B. HouseholdsHouseholds get utility from nondurable and durable consumption and disutility from working. Let Cn,t denote nondurable consumption, Cd,t durable consumption expenditures, the stock of the durable consumption good, and Nt labor supply. Households maximize expected discounted utilityand the stock of the durable consumption good evolves according towhere δ is the depreciation rate and S′′ governs adjustment costs on durables expenditures. Following Barsky, House, and Kimball (2007), the functional forms for household preferences arewhere σ is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, ψ determines the relative preference for nondurables versus durables, η is the elasticity of substitution between the two goods, ϕ is the Frisch labor supply elasticity, and χ governs the level of disutility from labor supply.Greater durability implies that any increase in consumption requires a more dramatic increase in expenditure. To increase consumption of the durable good by 1 percent from a steady state level requires an annual increase in expenditure of 1/δ percent, whereas a 1 percent increase in nondurables consumption requires only a 1 percent increase in expenditure. This motivates our use of durability as a shifter of goods demand and, because a larger increase in expenditure will call forth a larger increase in hours worked, labor demand as well.The household also owns the economy’s stock of physical capital (Ks), sets the utilization rate of capital (u), and rents capital services to firms in a competitive market. The relationship between capital services, utilization, and the physical capital stock isThe accumulation equation for capital mirrors that for durables consumption:where Ijf,t denotes investment that adds to the sector-jf capital stock. Note that Ijf,t is distinct from investment expenditures, which are given byInvestment expenditures include maintenance costs arising from capital utilization, . The cost function a(ṡ) is increasing, convex, and zero in steady state. In addition, investment is affected by investment-specific productivity ; greater productivity means less expenditure is required to achieve a given increase in the capital stock.Importantly, we have assumed each sector has a separate capital stock, which means that capital is (partially) fixed in the short run. Capital services can adjust immediately due to time-varying utilization, but utilization costs make utilization less than perfectly flexible. Capital stocks adjust fully over time, but the speed depends on investment adjustment costs.Households also supply labor to firms in each sector, and this process is intermediated by monopolistically competitive unions who have the power to set wages (Erceg, Henderson, and Levin 2000). The unions face Calvo frictions, altering wages with a constant probability of 1 – θw. Because wage stickiness does not vary by sector and labor supply across sectors is assumed to be perfectly elastic (Nt = ∑j,fNjf,t ), (nominal) wages Wt will be equalized across sectors.C. Analytical DiscussionBefore presenting numerical simulations, we use a stripped-down version of our model to analytically illustrate how cyclical movements in relative sector quantities, prices, and markups behave under sticky versus flexible prices. We assume the economy starts in steady state and evaluate the immediate response to an expansionary aggregate shock at time t. The stripped-down model features a constant aggregate capital stock, with the distribution of capital services across sectors fixed at time t but perfectly mobile by t + 1 (fixed capital utilization and no investment adjustment costs). We also assume durables goods are very long-lived (δ sufficiently small that the shadow value of durables is nearly invariant to short-lived shocks, as in Barsky, House, and Kimball 2007).With sufficiently long-lived durables, household optimization requireswhere hatted variables are log deviations from steady-state values. Furthermore, the law of motion for durables implies ; all produced goods are consumed ; the production functions are ; marginal costs are ; and markups are given by . Combining these expressions, we haveWe first consider a flexible-price economy. Markups are constant at μj = ε/(ε – 1). If sectors have the same capital intensities, equation (2) shows that labor will expand more in the durables sector. Thus, relative output, marginal costs, and prices also increase. Note that these relative movements do not depend on the underlying shock causing the expansion, but the movements are even larger if the source is a positive aggregate TFP shock.The results differ under sticky prices. Take the extreme of fixed prices, so that relative prices do not move. Equation (1) implies an increase in relative durables output, and thus labor and marginal costs. Therefore, relative markups are countercyclical. If prices are not perfectly rigid but are equally sticky in the two sectors, one can show that relative output, labor, and prices are procyclical, while relative markups are countercyclical.4 Thus, the primary (qualitative) difference between flexible and sticky prices is the behavior of relative markups.We have derived these predictions for relative movements in durables holding other characteristics—such as price flexibility, capital intensity, and TFP—fixed across sectors. This is important. For example, if durables prices were perfectly flexible and nondurables perfectly rigid, the relative durables markup would be procyclical and, under some parameters, relative labor could be countercyclical. Likewise, if the aggregate expansion was caused by a shock to durables TFP (Ad,t > An,t), one can show that, under sticky prices, the relative durables markup would again be procyclical (e.g., assuming η = 1 and αj = α). In our subsequent empirical analysis, therefore, we will control for variables that might be correlated with durability.So far, we have analyzed the response of durables relative to nondurables, but the model also predicts relative movements across goods on other dimensions, holding durability constant. Optimal demand by final (durable or nondurable) goods producers implieswhere h and l denote high- and low-capital-intensity firms. Assuming equally sticky prices in the two subsectors, one can derive the following expression for relative markupsso that higher-capital-intensity production implies a countercyclical markup. The sign of the relative movements in other variables depends on parameter values, although the more capital-intensive good typically has higher marginal costs and prices, but lower output.We can also use equation (3) to analyze how differences in price stickiness affect relative movements, now letting h and l denote firms with high and low price stickiness. We get the following relationship between relative labor and relative markups:That is, relative labor (and thus output and marginal costs) will move in the opposite direction of relative markups (and prices). Whether the relative markups are procyclical or countercyclical, however, depends on the nature of the underlying shock. Monetary (TFP) shocks that put upward (downward) pressure on prices will lead to countercyclical (procyclical) markups for the sector with stickier prices.D. Quantitative ResultsWe now calibrate and simulate the full-blown model. This allows us to move away from stark assumptions, such as the complete short-run fixity of capital, and consider realistic features like capital utilization and investment adjustment costs. We consider an empirically relevant amount of durability, capital intensity, and price stickiness in order to get a quantitative sense of the size of movements of key variables across sectors.Table 1 summarizes our model calibration. The parameters governing household preferences (σ, η, ϕ) and desired markups are set to standard values, and y is set to produce a steady-state nondurable-to-durable consumption ratio of 2.96. The annual depreciation rate of 5 percent matches the (weighted) average life span of durables in our data (i.e., twenty years). We set the household’s annual discount rate (3.34 percent) to match an investment-to-output ratio of 0.16, given the depreciation rate and an empirical aggregate capital share of 0.322. When we consider high- and low-capital intensity sectors, we use capital shares of ah = 0.475 and al = 0.169, which are the weighted average capital shares for consumption categories above and below the median capital share, respectively. Consistent with the microdata underlying the US CPI, the average price changes every four months, while high- and low-frequency firms set prices roughly every two and a half and twelve months. Wages are assumed to change once a year.Table 1. Model ParametersView Table ImageThe curvature of the utilization adjustment cost function is pinned down by the relationship between relative sector utilization rates and relative labor-to-capital ratios:Using Gorodnichenko and Shapiro (2011) data on twenty two-digit manufacturing sectors over the past thirty years, we regress utilization rates on labor-capital ratios (and time effects) to estimate an elasticity of 0.33, corresponding to a′′ = 2.0. Online appendix C has details (http://www.nber.org/data-appendix/c12756/appendix.pdf). For durables expenditure adjustment costs we set S′′ = 0.455/δ to match Cooper and Haltiwanger’s (2006) estimate of the elasticity of the investment rate with respect to Tobin’s Q.Finally, we need to calibrate the exogenous shock processes and the Taylor rule that governs monetary policy. With one exception, these parameters are monthly transformations of the quarterly estimates of Smets–Wouters (2007).5 We choose a larger volatility for the neutral technology shock to match the cyclicality of the aggregate labor share (i.e., inverse markup), but since our primary focus is on conditional impulse response functions, alternative calibrations of the volatility do not change the insights we draw from the model.Figures 1 to 4 show impulse responses to an expansionary monetary policy shock.6 We plot relative movements in output, labor, prices, and markups, where we measure markups using the inverse of the labor share. (Note that, under Cobb–Douglas production, fluctuations in markups are equivalent to fluctuations in the labor share. However, our test does not hinge on Cobb–Douglas production, and we will explicitly consider departures from it in our empirical analysis.) For scaling purposes, we also show the response of aggregate output (thin line). Figure 1 shows the relative durable-to-nondurable responses under sticky prices. For this exercise, the average capital intensity and price-change frequency in the two sectors are the same.7 Relative output (thick solid line) and labor (dashed line) are strongly procyclical, while the relative price response (dashed-dotted line) is also positive but muted by sticky prices. Relative markups (dotted line) are countercyclical, reflecting two forces: first and most important, price markups are more countercyclical for durables firms than for nondurables firms; second, within each sector the more labor-intensive subsector will gain market share because it has more flexibility to ramp up production. This composition effect will cause the labor share of both sectors to increase (decreasing the measured markup), but will be stronger for durables as their expenditures increase more.Fig. 1. Relative durables/nondurables response, sticky pricesNotes: Impulse response to monetary policy shock. Variable Y is output, N labor, P prices, and μ markups.View Large ImageDownload PowerPointThe immediate relative markup response is about 25 percent that of relative output, while the relative labor response is 25 percent greater than the output response. With wages equalized across sectors, . These magnitudes are, of course, dependent on our calibration. If the cost of varying capital utilization was zero (infinite), the relative labor response would be the same as (50 percent greater than) the relative output response.Figure 2 repeats the same exercise but with flexible prices in both sectors. (Note that wages are still sticky.) The monetary shock has smaller real effects under flexible prices; the aggregate output response is about 70 percent as big as the response under sticky prices. The relative price of durables now increases more, muting the shift in goods and labor demand toward durables. The relative markup response is nearly zero, with the small discrepancy solely reflecting the aforementioned composition effect.Fig. 2. Relative durables/nondurables response, flexible pricesNotes: Impulse response to monetary policy shock. Variable Y is output, N labor, P prices, and μ markups.View Large ImageDownload PowerPointFigure 3 demonstrates the effect of price flexibility in another way. We once again allow for sticky prices, as in figure 1, but consider lowand high-price flexibility subsectors (1 – θl = 0.08, 1 –θl = 0.42) and focus on movements within the durables sector. The subsector with less price flexibility will exhibit a more sluggish price response, decreasing its relative price and increasing its relative output, labor input, and marginal costs. Thus, firms whose prices respond more slowly (on average) to the monetary shock see their relative markups decline. The magnitude of the relative markup movement is almost half the magnitude of the relative output response.Fig. 3. Relative low/high price flexibility responseNotes: Impulse response to monetary policy shock. Variable Y is output, N labor, P prices, and μ markups.View Large ImageDownload PowerPointFinally, figure 4 compares high- and low-capital-intensity subsectors (ah = 0.475, al = 0.169) within the durables sector, while keeping prices equally sticky. In response to an expansionary shock, firms with more capital-intensive technologies face steeper marginal cost curves. Although their relative markup decreases (as shown analytically), their higher marginal costs lead to a higher relative price and lower relative output. Note that the magnitude of the markup response is greater than the output response because the initial relative labor response is positive under our calibration, although this result is quite sensitive to the capital-intensity gap (ah – al) and fixity of the capital stock. At any rate, the relative labor response is more muted than under flexible prices, where markups are constant and the higher marginal costs of high-capital-intensity firms are completely passed through into relative prices, resulting in a larger decrease in relative output and a decrease in relative hours.Fig. 4. Relative high/low capital intensity response, sticky pricesNotes: Impulse response to monetary policy shock. Variable Y is output, N labor, P prices, and μ markups.View Large ImageDownload PowerPointTo recap, the Keynesian labor demand hypothesis is that firms respond to unexpectedly low demand for their goods by laying off workers rather than lowering their output prices. Equivalently, if marginal cost curves are upward sloping, firms increase their markups. In this section we have considered one possible source of this behavior—nominal price stickiness—and have shown that the relative markups of more durable and more capital-intensive goods are (essentially) constant under flexible prices but countercyclical under sticky prices.8 In our empirical analysis, we will exploit variation across different types of goods to test this prediction of Keynesian labor demand.The model is also helpful for clarifying why we do not simply examine the cyclicality of the aggregate markup in the data. The reason is that, even under sticky prices, the aggregate markup can be uncorrelated with output. This is what happens, for example, in the Smets–Wouters (2007) model estimated on US data. The reason is that the aggregate markup responds positively to some expansionary shocks but negatively to others. We demonstrate this in figures 5 and 6, which show impulse responses to all four aggregate shocks in our DSGE model. We scale the shocks to have the same initial effect on aggregate output (figure 5), while figure 6 shows the different aggregate markup responses to the various shocks. Of course, one could address this by conditioning on particular aggregate shocks à la Galí (1999). But we pursue a different, complementary approach of examining how relative markups respond to relative demand shocks across industries.Fig. 5.

Evidence on Durability and the Cyclicality of ExpendituresWe now construct demand predictors across industries. We start with the BLS’s classification of goods in the CPI into seventy Expenditure Classes (ECs). (See appendix 6 in http://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/pdf/homch17.pdf.) We combine four pairs of ECs and drop five others due to missing NIPA data or overlap with NIPA investment categories, leaving us with sixty-one consumer goods.9 We then add nine categories of investment from NIPA, leaving us with a total of seventy expenditure categories. Online appendix table 1 provides the full list.For each of these seventy categories, we create two demand predictors. The first is based on the good’s durability, and the second is based on the Engel curve slope for the good (i.e., the extent to which the good is a luxury or necessity). We also construct two variables specific to each category that should affect how prices and costs respond to demand: the frequency of price change and the importance of capital versus labor in producing the good.A. DurabilityOf our seventy goods, twenty-eight are classified by NIPA as durable goods (nineteen of the sixty-one consumer goods are durables, and all nine of the investment goods). We use two sources to quantify the durability of the durables. A primary source is life expectancy tables from a major property-casualty insurance company, which we use for seventeen goods. For autos, tires, and the nine investment categories we use estimates from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA, http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=10&step=1).Among the twenty-eight durable goods, the extent of durability varies widely. It is over thirty years for residential structures and three types of commercial buildings. For business equipment it ranges from four to eleven years (with information equipment and software at the less durable end, presumably due to obsolescence). Durability also varies among the nineteen consumer durables. At the low end are clothing categories (less than five years) and at the upper end are appliances and electronics (closer to ten years). We classify the remaining forty-two consumption categories as nondurables (i.e., lasting less than a year). These include food and services.B. Engel CurvesWhether a good is a luxury or necessity should also help predict cyclicality of demand. To estimate Engel curves, we turn to the US Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) Interview Surveys. We pool CE crosssections from 1982 to 2010 to estimate Engel elasticities for our sixty-one consumer goods and for housing services.10 The CE Interview Survey lumps together all food for home consumption, so for these categories we estimate a common elasticity.Households are interviewed up to four consecutive quarters on their detailed expenditures. We estimate Engel elasticities by regressing spending on each category from the household’s second through fourth interviews on the sum of its spending during those same three quarters. We instrument for the log of a household’s total expenditures in its final three interviews based on its (logged) total and nondurable expenditures from the first quarterly interview, as well as its (logged) before-tax annual income reported in both the first and final interviews. We instrument to limit attenuation bias from measurement error in household total expenditures. We do not log expenditures for individual categories, the dependent variables in the second stage, as these are zero in some cases. Instead we divide the household’s spending on a category by mean spending on that category across households. Thus our elasticities are relative to mean household spending on that category.11For the nine NIPA i",Benjamin A. Malin; Benjamin Malin; Mark Bils; Peter J.

Notes on the accumulation and utilization of capital: Some empirical issues,"Abstract The paper makes three contributions. First, it provides an in‐depth examination of the Federal Reserve measure of capacity utilization and shows that it is closer to a cyclical indicator than a measure of long‐run variations of normal utilization. Other measures, such as the Average Workweek of Capital or the National Emergency Utilization Rate are more appropriate for examining long‐run changes in utilization. Second, and related to that, it argues that a relatively stationary measure of utilization is not consistent with any theory of the determination of utilization. Third, based on data on the lifetime of fixed assets it shows that for the issues around the “utilization controversy” the long run is a period after thirty years or more. This makes it a platonic idea for some economic problems.",Michalis Nikiforos,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/meca.12339,"Measure (data warehouse), Economics, Capital (architecture), Empirical examination, Capital expenditure, Capacity utilization, Macroeconomics, Econometrics, Actuarial science, Finance, Computer science, Archaeology, Database, History",University of Geneva,University of Geneva,University of Geneva
Residential mobility among adult cancer survivors in the United States,"Abstract Background While residential mobility affects people’s health, the dynamic of neighborhood tenure and its associated factors among cancer patients and survivors have not been studied in detail. This cross-sectional study aimed to identify sociodemographic factors associated with neighborhood tenure and relocation after the first cancer diagnosis among U.S. adult cancer survivors and patients. Methods Based on a nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized civilian adults (≥18 years, n = 185,637) from the 2013–2018 National Health Interview Survey, we compared neighborhood tenure between adults with and without a history of cancer, and identified factors associated with their neighborhood tenure and relocation after the first cancer diagnosis, using propensity score matching, and logistic regression models with survey design incorporated. Results Among adults with cancer (9.0%), 39.6% had a neighborhood tenure ≤10 years (vs. 61.2% among those without cancer), and 25.6% (equivalent to 5.4 million) relocated after their first cancer diagnosis. The odds of having shorter neighborhood tenure was higher among the cancer group in the propensity-matched samples (odds ratio = 1.05; 95% CI: 1.05–1.06; n = 17,259). Among cancer survivors, the odds of neighborhood relocation were negatively associated with increasing age, perceived neighborhood social cohesion, having high school level education, and being married; while positively associated with having family income below the poverty threshold, being uninsured, and living in non-Northeast regions. Conclusions High residential mobility was found among a sizable proportion of adults with a history of cancer, and was associated with multiple socioeconomic factors. Incorporating and addressing modifiable risk factors associated with residential mobility among cancer patients and survivors may offer new intervention opportunities to improve cancer care delivery and reduce cancer disparities.",Bian Liu; Francis Boscoe; Francis P.

Financial Frictions and Fluctuations in Volatility,"The US Great Recession featured a large decline in output and labor, tighter financial conditions, and a large increase in firm growth dispersion. We build a model in which increased volatility at the firm level generates a downturn and worsened credit conditions. The key idea is that hiring inputs is risky because financial frictions limit firms’ ability to insure against shocks. An increase in volatility induces firms to reduce their inputs to reduce such risk. Our model can generate most of the decline in output and labor in the Great Recession and the observed increase in firms’ interest rate spreads.",Cristina Arellano; Patrick J.

SME Failures Under Large Liquidity Shocks: An Application to the COVID-19 Crisis,"We develop a flexible framework for tracking business failures during economic downturns.Our framework combines firm-level data with a model of cost-minimization where firms react to a rich set of shocks and fail if illiquid.After verifying that our methodology approximates past official failure rates, we apply it to the COVID-19 crisis in 11 countries.Absent government support, SME failures would have increased by 6.15 percentage points, representing 3.15 percent of employment.We find little threat to financial stability.Commonly implemented COVID-19 policies saved firms but were costly because funds were directed to firms that could survive without support.",Nick Sander; Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas; Pierre‐Olivier Gourinchas; Veronika Penciakova; Ṣebnem Kalemli-Özcan; Ṣebnem Kalemli‐Özcan,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w27877,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Market liquidity, Financial system, Business, Liquidity crisis, Economics, Monetary economics, Financial crisis, Macroeconomics, Medicine, Internal medicine, Disease, Infectious disease (medical specialty)","Institute of Materials Finishing; Bank of Canada; Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Berkeley; University of Maryland, College Park","Bank of Canada 234 Wellington St. W Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0G9 Canada; Department of Economics University of California, Berkeley 530 Evans Hall #3880 Berkeley, CA 94720-3880; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; colleagues at the IMF,; Department of Economics University of Maryland Tydings Hall 4118D College Park, MD 20742-7211; Research Department Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta 1000 Peachtree St. NE Atlanta, GA 30309-4470","Bank of Canada 234 Wellington St. W Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0G9 Canada; Department of Economics University of California, Berkeley 530 Evans Hall #3880 Berkeley, CA 94720-3880; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; colleagues at the IMF,; Department of Economics University of Maryland Tydings Hall 4118D College Park, MD 20742-7211; Research Department Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta 1000 Peachtree St. NE Atlanta, GA 30309-4470"
Business Exit During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Non-Traditional Measures in Historical Context,"&lt;ns2:p&gt;Lags in official data releases have forced economists and policymakers to leverage ""alternative"" or ""non-traditional"" data to measure business exit resulting from the COVID- 19 pandemic. We first review official data on business exit in recent decades to place the alternative measures of exit within historical context. For the U.S., business exit is countercyclical and fairly common, with about 7.5 percent of firms exiting annually in recent years. Both the high level and the cyclicality of exit are driven by very small firms and establishments. We then explore a range of alternative measures of business exit, including novel measures based on paycheck issuance and phone-tracking data, which indicate exit was elevated in certain sectors during the first year of the pandemic. The evidence is mixed, however; many industries have likely seen lower-than-usual exit rates, and exiting businesses do not appear to represent a large share of U.S. employment. Actual exit is likely to have been lower than widespread expectations from early in the pandemic. Moreover, businesses have recently exhibited notable optimism about their survival prospects.&lt;/ns2:p&gt;",Aaron Flaaen; Adrian Hamins-Puertolas; C Kurz; Christopher Kurz; Leland D. Crane; Ryan A.

The data show that 50 percent of adults worldwide have an account at a formal financial institution, though account penetration varies widely across regions, income groups and individual characteristics. In addition, 22 percent of adults report having saved at a formal financial institution in the past 12 months, and 9 percent report having taken out a new loan from a bank, credit union or microfinance institution in the past year. Although half of adults around the world remain unbanked, at least 35 percent of them report barriers to account use that might be addressed by public policy. Among the most commonly reported barriers are high cost, physical distance, and lack of proper documentation, though there are significant differences across regions and individual characteristics.

The World Development Report 1992 explores the links between economic development and the environment. The 1990 report on poverty, last year's report on development strategies, and this report constitute a trilogy on the goals and means of development. The main message of this year's report is the need to integrate environmental considerations into development policymaking. The report argues that continued, and even accelerated, economic and human development is sustainable and can be consistent with improving environmental conditions, but that this will require major policy, program, and institutional shifts. A twofold strategy is required. First, the positive links between efficient income growth and the environment need to be aggressively exploited. Second, strong policies and institutions need to be put in place which cause decision makers to adopt less damaging forms of behavior. Where tradeoffs exist between income growth and environmental quality, the report argues for a careful assessment of the costs and benefits of alternative policies. This approach will result in much less environmental damage.

Labor Supply Effects of Occupational Regulation: Evidence from the Nurse Licensure Compact,"There is concern that licensure requirements impede mobility of licensed professionals to areas of high demand.Nursing has not been immune to this criticism, especially in the context of perceived nurse shortages and large expected future demand.The Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC) was introduced to solve this problem by permitting registered nurses to practice across state lines without obtaining additional licensure.We exploit the staggered adoption of the NLC to examine whether a reduction in licensure-induced barriers alters the nurse labor market.Using data on over 1.8 million nurses and other health care workers we find no evidence that the labor supply or mobility of nurses increases following the adoption of the NLC, even among the residents of counties bordering other NLC states who are potentially most affected by the NLC.This suggests that nationalizing occupational licensing will not substantially reduce labor market frictions.",Christina DePasquale; Kevin Stange,,,,,,,,,,,,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w22344,"Licensure, Occupational licensing, Registered nurse, Labour economics, Business, Nursing, Demographic economics, Psychology, Medicine, Economics, Microeconomics",Emory University; University of Michigan–Ann Arbor; State Street (United States); University of Virginia; National Bureau of Economic Research,"School of Public Policy University of Michigan 5236 Weill Hall 735 South State Street Ann Arbor, MI 48109 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; participants at the Rollins School of Public Health, University of Virginia; Emory University 1602 Fishburne Dr. Atlanta, GA, 30322; School of Law, Ford School of Public Policy, ASHEcon 2014, APPAM 2014, ASSA","School of Public Policy University of Michigan 5236 Weill Hall 735 South State Street Ann Arbor, MI 48109 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; participants at the Rollins School of Public Health, University of Virginia; Emory University 1602 Fishburne Dr. Atlanta, GA, 30322; School of Law, Ford School of Public Policy, ASHEcon 2014, APPAM 2014, ASSA"
The Effect of Occupational Licensing Stringency on the Teacher Quality Distribution,"Concerned about the low academic ability of public school teachers, in the 1990s and 2000s, some states increased licensing stringency to weed out low-quality candidates, while others decreased restrictions to attract high-quality candidates.We offer a theoretical model justifying both reactions.Using data from 1991-2007 on licensing requirements and teacher quality-as measured by the selectivity of teachers' undergraduate institutions-we find that stricter licensing requirements, especially those emphasizing academic coursework, increase the left tail of the quality distribution for secondary school teachers without significantly decreasing quality for high-minority or high-poverty districts.",Adam Kapor; Bradley Larsen; Chuan Yu; Ziao Ju,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w28158,"Coursework, Occupational licensing, Quality (philosophy), Distribution (mathematics), Poverty, Mathematics education, Alternative teacher certification, Demographic economics, Business, Psychology, Medical education, Economics, Economic growth, Mathematics, Teacher education, Medicine, Microeconomics, Physics, Mathematical analysis, Quantum mechanics",National Bureau of Economic Research; Princeton University; Stanford University,"Department of Economics Princeton University 280 Julis Romo Rabinowitz Building Princeton, NJ 08544; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Stanford University 579 Jane Stanford Way Stanford, CA 94305; seminar participants at Brown University, MIT, Stanford, Texas A\&M University, the 2014 International Industrial; Department of Economics Stanford University 579 Jane Stanford Way Stanford, CA 94305 and","Department of Economics Princeton University 280 Julis Romo Rabinowitz Building Princeton, NJ 08544; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Stanford University 579 Jane Stanford Way Stanford, CA 94305; Department of Economics Stanford University 579 Jane Stanford Way Stanford, CA 94305 and; seminar participants at Brown University, MIT, Stanford, Texas A\&M University, the 2014 International Industrial"
Race and Economic Opportunity in the United States: an Intergenerational Perspective*,"Abstract We study the sources of racial disparities in income using anonymized longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population from 1989 to 2015. We document three results. First, black Americans and American Indians have much lower rates of upward mobility and higher rates of downward mobility than whites, leading to persistent disparities across generations. Conditional on parent income, the black-white income gap is driven by differences in wages and employment rates between black and white men; there are no such differences between black and white women. Hispanic Americans have rates of intergenerational mobility more similar to whites than blacks, leading the Hispanic-white income gap to shrink across generations. Second, differences in parental marital status, education, and wealth explain little of the black-white income gap conditional on parent income. Third, the black-white gap persists even among boys who grow up in the same neighborhood. Controlling for parental income, black boys have lower incomes in adulthood than white boys in 99% of Census tracts. The few areas with small black-white gaps tend to be low-poverty neighborhoods with low levels of racial bias among whites and high rates of father presence among blacks. Black males who move to such neighborhoods earlier in childhood have significantly better outcomes. However, less than 5% of black children grow up in such areas. Our findings suggest that reducing the black-white income gap will require efforts whose impacts cross neighborhood and class lines and increase upward mobility specifically for black men.",Maggie R Jones; Maggie R.

Early Predictors of Racial Disparities in Criminal Justice Involvement,"We examine ten cohorts of male eighth graders in public schools in Chicago, IL: 1995-2004.We find that composite measures of math achievement, reading achievement, and neighborhood SES during elementary school are strong predictors of future felony arraignment and incarceration, even among students of the same race who attend the same school.Nonetheless, elementary achievement and early SES account for less than half of Black versus non-Black disparities in these outcomes.Value-added measures of eighth grade school quality suggest that schools may reduce criminal justice involvement by better preparing students for the non-cognitive demands of high school.",Andrew Jordan; Derek Neal; Ezra Karger,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w32428,"Criminology, Criminal justice, Economic Justice, Political science, Psychology, Law",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago; Washington University in St. Louis,"Department of Economics Washington University in St Louis One Brookings Dr. St Louis, MO 63105; Department of Economics University of Chicago 1126 East 59th Street Chicago, IL 60637 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 230 South LaSalle Street Chicago, IL 60604","Department of Economics Washington University in St Louis One Brookings Dr. St Louis, MO 63105; Department of Economics University of Chicago 1126 East 59th Street Chicago, IL 60637 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 230 South LaSalle Street Chicago, IL 60604"
DO MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES INFLUENCE WORKER HEALTH?,"This study investigates whether minimum wage increases impact worker health in the United States. We consider self‐reported measures of general, mental, and physical health. We use data on lesser‐skilled workers from the 1993 to 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey. Among men, we find no evidence that minimum wage increases improve health; instead, we find that such increases lead to worse health outcomes, particularly among unemployed men. We find both worsening general health and improved mental health following minimum wage increases among women. These findings broaden our understanding of the full impacts of minimum wage increases on lesser‐skill workers. ( JEL I1, I11, I18)",Brady P. Horn; Johanna Catherine Maclean; Michael R.

"Obama, Katrina, and the Persistence of Racial Inequality","New benchmark estimates of Black-White income ratios for 1870, 1900, and 1940 are combined with standard post-World War census data. The resulting time series reveals that the pace of racial income convergence has generally been steady but slow, quickening only during the 1940s and the modern Civil Rights era. I explore the interpretation of the time series with a model of intergenerational transmission of inequality in which racial differences in causal factors that determine income are very large just after the Civil War and which erode slowly across subsequent generations. “The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line.” —W.

The Opportunities and Challenges of Using Administrative Data Linkages to Evaluate Mobility,"Since Alan Krueger’s christening of the Great Gatsby curve, there has been increased attention given to the relationship between inequality and intergenerational social mobility in the United States. Studying intergenerational mobility (IGM) requires longitudinal data across large spans of time as well as the ability to follow parents and children over multiple generations. Few longitudinal datasets meet this need. This article surveys available data and the current and potential issues surrounding the use of administrative records to vastly extend the study of IGM. First, we describe the U.S. Census Bureau’s current uses of administrative records in the linkage of households across household surveys such as the Current Population Survey (CPS), American Community Survey (ACS), Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), and the decennial censuses. Then, we describe the possibilities of creating additional parent-child linkages using the SIPP linked to decennial censuses and the ACS. Last, we outline our model to create linkages across earlier census data (e.g., 1980 and 1990) and contemporary surveys.",Amy O’Hara; Catherine Massey; David Johnson; David S.

It is intended to help policymakers, students, analysts, professors, program managers, and citizens find and use data related to all aspects of development, including those that help monitor progress toward the World Bank Group's two goals of ending poverty and promoting shared prosperity. Six themes are used to organize indicators—world view, people, environment, economy, states and markets, and global links. As in past editions, World Development Indicators reviews global progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and provides key indicators related to poverty. WDI 2015 includes: * A selection of the most popular indicators across 214 economies and 14 country groups organized into six WDI themes * Thematic and regional highlights, providing an overview of global development trends * An in-depth review of the progress made toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals * A user guide describing resources available online and on mobile apps A complementary online data analysis tool is available this year to allow readers to further investigate global, regional, and country progress on the MDGs: data.worldbank.org/mdgs. Each of the remaining sections includes an introduction; six stories highlighting specific global, regional or country trends; and a table of the most relevant and popular indicators for that theme, together with a discussion of indicator compilation methodology.

Racial and Ethnic Differences in the Geography of Intergenerational Mobility,"We use the NLSY79 to produce the first estimates of intergenerational mobility in the U.S. by both region and race/ethnicity. We show that gaps in intergenerational mobility by race are significantly larger than those by region. In particular, there is no region in the United States where it is better to be poor and black compared to being equally poor and white. We also show that the expected rank of Hispanics falls between that of whites and blacks. We find that the low mobility in the Southeast of the US documented by Chetty et al (2014) is actually driven by low mobility by whites and that blacks who grew up in the Southeast actually experience higher mobility than blacks growing up in the Northeast and Midwest. We also directly examine the role of migration and find that it plays little role in explaining the regional heterogeneity in intergenerational mobility. Finally, we use a rich set of individual covariates available in the NLSY — including test scores — and show that these can explain much of the gaps by race/ethnicity.",Bhashkar Mazumder; Jonathan Davis; Jonathan M.

Black Americans’ Landholdings and Economic Mobility after Emancipation: Evidence from the Census of Agriculture and Linked Records,"Large and persistent racial disparities in land-based wealth were an important legacy of the Reconstruction era. To assess how these disparities were transmitted intergenerationally, we build a dataset to observe Black households’ landholdings in 1880 alongside a sample of White households. We then link sons from all households to the 1900 census records to observe their economic and human capital outcomes. We show that Black landowners, relative to laborers, transmitted substantial intergenerational advantages to their sons, particularly in literacy and homeownership. However, such advantages were small relative to the racial gaps in measures of economic status.",Marianne H. Wanamaker; Marianne Wanamaker; Nicholas Holtkamp; William J.

Labor Market Fluidity and Economic Performance,"U.S. labor markets became much less fluid in recent decades.Job reallocation rates fell more than a quarter after 1990, and worker reallocation rates fell more than a quarter after 2000.The declines cut across states, industries and demographic groups defined by age, gender and education.Younger and less educated workers had especially large declines, as did the retail sector.A shift to older businesses, an aging workforce, and policy developments that suppress reallocation all contributed to fluidity declines.Drawing on previous work, we argue that reduced fluidity has harmful consequences for productivity, real wages and employment.To quantify the effects of reallocation intensity on employment, we estimate regression models that exploit low frequency variation over time within states, using state-level changes in population composition and other variables as instruments.We find large positive effects of worker reallocation rates on employment, especially for young workers and the less educated.Similar estimates obtain when dropping data from the Great Recession and its aftermath.These results suggest the U.S. economy faced serious impediments to high employment rates well before the Great Recession, and that sustained high employment is unlikely to return without restoring labor market fluidity.",John Haltiwanger; Steven Davis; Steven J.

Big Bad Banks? The Winners and Losers from Bank Deregulation in the United States,"ABSTRACT We assess the impact of bank deregulation on the distribution of income in the United States. From the 1970s through the 1990s, most states removed restrictions on intrastate branching, which intensified bank competition and improved bank performance. Exploiting the cross‐state, cross‐time variation in the timing of branch deregulation, we find that deregulation materially tightened the distribution of income by boosting incomes in the lower part of the income distribution while having little impact on incomes above the median. Bank deregulation tightened the distribution of income by increasing the relative wage rates and working hours of unskilled workers.",ALEXEY LEVKOV; Alexey Levkov; ROSS LEVINE; Ross Levine; THORSTEN BECK; Thorsten Beck,,,,,,,,,,,,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2010.01589.x,"Deregulation, Economics, Distribution (mathematics), Income distribution, Wage, Competition (biology), Labour economics, Monetary economics, Market economy, Inequality, Mathematical analysis, Ecology, Mathematics, Biology",International Monetary Fund; Federal Reserve; Tilburg University; Center for Economic and Policy Research; University of Virginia; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Tilburg University and CEPR,; Federal Reserve System, Brown University, Boston University, International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank, Georgia State University, New York University, Tilburg University, University of Frankfurt, University of Lausanne, University of Mannheim, and the; University of Virginia.","Tilburg University and CEPR,; Federal Reserve System, Brown University, Boston University, International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank, Georgia State University, New York University, Tilburg University, University of Frankfurt, University of Lausanne, University of Mannheim, and the; University of Virginia."
Does Credit Competition Affect Small‐Firm Finance?,"ABSTRACT While relaxation of geographical restrictions on bank expansion permitted banking organizations to expand across state lines, it allowed states to erect barriers to branch expansion. These differences in states' branching restrictions affect credit supply. In states more open to branching, small firms borrow at interest rates 80 to 100 basis points lower than firms operating in less open states. Firms in open states also are more likely to borrow from banks. Despite this evidence that interstate branch openness expands credit supply, we find no effect of variation in state restrictions on branching on the amount that small firms borrow.",Philip E.

Finance and Inequality: Theory and Evidence,"In this paper, we critically review the literature on finance and inequality, highlighting substantive gaps in the literature. Finance plays a crucial role in the preponderance of theories of persistent inequality. Unsurprisingly, therefore, economic theory provides a rich set of predictions concerning both the impact of finance on inequality and about the relevant mechanisms. While subject to ample qualifications, the bulk of empirical research suggests that improvements in financial contracts, markets, and intermediaries expand economic opportunities and reduce inequality. Yet, there is a shortage of theoretical and empirical research on the potentially enormous impact of formal financial sector policies, such as bank regulations and securities law, on persistent inequality. Furthermore, we lack a conceptual framework for considering the joint and endogenous evolution of finance, inequality, and economic growth.",Asli Demirgüç-Kunt; Aslı Demirgüç-Kunt; Ross Levine,,,,,,,,,,,,2009.0,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.financial.050808.114334,"Inequality, Economics, Financial intermediary, Economic inequality, Empirical evidence, Economic shortage, Finance, Intermediary, Empirical research, Set (abstract data type), Mathematical analysis, Philosophy, Linguistics, Mathematics, Epistemology, Government (linguistics), Computer science, Programming language",National Bureau of Economic Research; World Bank; Brown University,"Brown University and the NBER, Providence, Rhode Island 02912;;  National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); World Bank, Washington, D.C. 20433;","Brown University and the NBER, Providence, Rhode Island 02912;;  National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); World Bank, Washington, D.C. 20433;"

Who Creates Jobs? Small versus Large versus Young,"The view that small businesses create the most jobs remains appealing to policymakers and small business advocates. Using data from the Census Bureau's Business Dynamics Statistics and Longitudinal Business Database, we explore the many issues at the core of this ongoing debate. We find that the relationship between firm size and employment growth is sensitive to these issues. However, our main finding is that once we control for firm age, there is no systematic relationship between firm size and growth.

Spatial Determinants of Entrepreneurship in India,"Ghani E., Kerr W. R. and O'Connell S. Spatial determinants of entrepreneurship in India, Regional Studies. The spatial determinants of entrepreneurship in India in the manufacturing and services sectors are analysed. Among general district traits, the quality of the physical infrastructure and workforce education are the strongest predictors of entry, with labour laws and household banking access also playing important roles. Extensive evidence is also found of agglomeration economies among manufacturing industries. In particular, supportive incumbent industrial structures for input and output markets are strongly linked to higher establishment entry rates. In comparison with the United States, regional conditions in India play a stronger relative role for the spatial patterns of entrepreneurship compared with incumbent industry locations.",Ejaz Ghani; Stephen D.

Can Fixed-term Contracts Put Low Skilled Youth on a Better Career Path? Evidence from Spain,"By reducing the commitment made by employers, fixed-term contracts can help low-skilled youth find a first job. However, the long-term impact of fixed-term contracts on these workers' careers may be negative. Using Spanish social security data, we analysed the impact of a large liberalisation in the regulation of fixed-term contracts in 1984. Using a cohort regression discontinuity design, we find that over the first 10 years in the labour market, the reform reduced the number of days worked (by 4.9%) and earnings (by 9.8%). Over 27 years of labour market career, yearly earnings losses amount to a persistent 7.3%.",Ioana Marinescu; J Ignacio García-Pérez; José Ignacio García Pérez; Judit Vall Castello; Judit Vall Castelló,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/ecoj.12621,"Term (time), Path (computing), Labour economics, Career path, Economics, Business, Management, Computer science, Physics, Quantum mechanics, Programming language",Universidad Pablo de Olavide; Fundación de Estudios de Economía Aplicada; University of Pennsylvania; Barcelona School of Economics; Universitat de Barcelona,"Department of Economics & Institut d'Economia de Barcelona (IEB), Universitat de Barcelona & CRES-UPF; Universidad Pablo de Olavide, and FEDEA; University of Pennsylvania & NBER","Department of Economics & Institut d'Economia de Barcelona (IEB), Universitat de Barcelona & CRES-UPF; Universidad Pablo de Olavide, and FEDEA; University of Pennsylvania & NBER"
The Micro-Dynamics of Skill Mix Change in a Dual Labor Market: The Spanish Manufacturing Experience,"As in many other developed countries, the share of skilled workers in Spain’s labor force dramatically increased during the 1990s. This paper decomposes the aggregate skill mix change by a set of key firm characteristics and in the context of Spain’s dual labor market. We find that continuing firms were the major drivers of skill mix growth and that expanding firms in particular increased their ratio of skilled workers. Net entry played a smaller but positive role due to higher-skilled entrants and lower-skilled exiters. Finally, we find that although firms with higher concentrations of temporary workers make bigger employment changes overall, firms’ low-skilled employment is more strongly pro-cyclical than is high skilled employment.",Adela Luque; C.

Health Insurance and Productivity: Evidence from the Manufacturing Sector,"This paper examines the relationship between employer-sponsored offers of health insurance and establishments’ labor productivity. Our empirical work is based on unique plant level data that links the 1997 and 2002 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component with the 1992, 1997, and 2002 Census of Manufactures. These linked data provide information on employer-provided insurance and productivity. We find that health insurance offers are positively associated with levels of establishments’ labor productivity. These findings hold for all manufacturers as well as those with fewer than 100 employees. Our preliminary results also show a drop in health care costs from the 75th to the 25th percentile would increase the probability of a plant offering insurance by 1.5-2.0 percent in both 1997 and 2002.

Labor Unions and Social Insurance,"The United States has experienced a significant decline in labor unions over the past half-century.We examine the aggregate labor market impact of labor unions, the causes of their decline, and their welfare and distributional consequences, accounting for unions' effects on wages and employers' insurance provisions.We first provide descriptive evidence that social insurance expansions contribute to the union's decline.We then develop and estimate an equilibrium labor search model where unionization, wages, employers' insurance provisions, and job security are endogenously determined.We find that, while skill-biased technological changes and Right-to-Work laws respectively explain 32% and 7%of the union decline from 1955 to 2019, social insurance expansions account for 15%.Our analysis also indicates that social insurance expansion can affect inequality through (de)unionization, and inequality may increase or decrease depending on how social insurance is targeted.Subsidizing unions lowers overall social welfare but increases the welfare of low-skilled workers.",Hanming Fang; Katsuhiro Komatsu; Naoki Aizawa,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w32793,"Social insurance, Labour economics, Business, Economics, Market economy",University of Hong Kong; University of Wisconsin–Madison; SIL International; University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research; California Institute of Technology,"Seoul National, UCLA, Wisconsin-Madison, Uppsala, and Western,; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of Wisconsin-Madison 1180 Observatory Drive Madison, WI 53706; NBER Summer Institute (Inequality and Macroeconomics, 2024), Penn, Rice,; Department of Economics Ronald O.

Will Divestment from Employment‐Based Health Insurance Save Employers Money? The Case of State and Local Governments,"Reforms introduced by the Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act (ACA) build new sources of coverage around employment‐based health insurance. But what if firms find it cheaper to have their employees obtain insurance from these sources, even after accounting for penalties (for nonprovision of insurance) and employee bonuses (to ensure the shift is cost neutral for employees)? State and local governments (SLGs) have strong incentives to consider the economics of such “divestment”; many have particularly large unfunded benefits liabilities. We investigated whether SLGs would save under two scenarios: (1) shifting all employees and under‐65 retirees to alternative sources of coverage and (2) shifting only employees whose household incomes indicate they would be eligible for federally‐subsidized coverage and all under‐65 retirees. Full divestment would cost SLGs more than they currently pay, due primarily to penalty costs. Selective divestment could save SLGs nearly $129 billion over 10 years at the expense of the federal government.",David M. Studdert; Jay Bhattacharya; Jeremy D.

Falling ill raises the health insurer's administration bill,"In many countries, governments use payment systems to compensate health insurers more for enrollees with higher expected costs. However, little empirical research has examined whether these payment systems should also include health insurers' administrative costs. We provide two sources of evidence that health insurers with a more morbid population have higher administrative costs. First, we show at the customer level a causal relationship between individual morbidity and individual administrative contacts with the insurer, using the weekly evolution of the number of individual customer contacts (calls, emails, in-person visits etc.) of a large Swiss health insurer. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the onset of a chronic illness causes on average a persistent increase of about 40% in individuals' contacts with the health insurer. Second, we provide evidence that this relationship also holds for total administrative costs at the insurer level. We study twenty years of Swiss health insurance market data and find a positive elasticity of around 1, indicating that, all else equal, an insurer with a more morbid population, equal to 1% more health care spending, faces about 1% higher administrative costs.",Lukas Kauer; Rudy Douven,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2023.115856,"Payment, Health care, Population, Actuarial science, Health economics, Health insurance, Business, Demographic economics, Economics, Medicine, Finance, Environmental health, Economic growth",University of Zurich; Erasmus University Rotterdam; CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis; University of Lucerne,"CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, Bezuidenhoutseweg 30, 2594, AV, The Hague, the Netherlands; University of Lucerne, Faculty of Economics and Management, Frohburgstrasse 3, 6002, Lucerne, Switzerland; CSS Institute for Empirical Health Economics, Tribschenstrasse 21, 6002, Lucerne, Switzerland; Erasmus University Rotterdam, Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, 3062, PA, Rotterdam, the Netherlands; University of Zurich, Department of Economics, Schönberggasse 1, 8001, Zurich, Switzerland","CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, Bezuidenhoutseweg 30, 2594, AV, The Hague, the Netherlands; University of Lucerne, Faculty of Economics and Management, Frohburgstrasse 3, 6002, Lucerne, Switzerland; CSS Institute for Empirical Health Economics, Tribschenstrasse 21, 6002, Lucerne, Switzerland; Erasmus University Rotterdam, Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, 3062, PA, Rotterdam, the Netherlands; University of Zurich, Department of Economics, Schönberggasse 1, 8001, Zurich, Switzerland"
"Going into the Affordable Care Act: Measuring the Size, Structure and Performance of the Individual and Small Group Markets for Health Insurance","The Affordable Care Act (ACA) will dramatically alter health insurance markets and the sources through which individuals obtain coverage.As the ACA is implemented, it is essential to monitor the intended and the unintended consequences of these regulations.To evaluate the changes in health insurance markets linked to the ACA, it is critical to consistently measure the size and structure of health insurance markets, as well as the performance of participating health insurers, prior to and post-ACA.In this paper we discuss challenges of describing the size, structure, and performance of the individual and small group markets.Next, we discuss improvements in data availability starting in 2010 to address some of these concerns.Finally, using data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), we evaluate insurance market structure and performance during 2010-2012, focusing on enrollment, the number of participating insurers, premiums, claims spending, MLR, and administrative expenses.",Jean Abraham; Kosali Simon; Pinar Karaca-Mandic; Pinar Karaca‐Mandic; Roger Feldman,,,,,,,,,,,,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w19719,"Health insurance, Business, Actuarial science, Group (periodic table), Health care, Economics, Economic growth, Chemistry, Organic chemistry",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota; Indiana University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Indiana University Bloomington,"School of Public and Environmental Affairs Indiana University Rm 359 1315 East Tenth Street Bloomington, IN 47405-1701; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; University of Minnesota; Indiana University and NBER; University of Minnesota and NBER; Division of Health Policy and Management University of Minnesota 420 Delaware Street SE, MMC 729 Minneapolis, MN 55455 and; Health Policy and Management School of Public Health University of Minnesota Mayo Mail Code 729 420 Delware Street S.E.

THE EFFECTS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ON HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE AND LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES,"The Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes several provisions designed to expand health insurance coverage that also alter the tie between employment and health insurance. In this paper, we exploit variation across geographic areas in the potential impact of the ACA to estimate its effect on health insurance and labor market outcomes in its first four years. Our findings indicate that approximately 70 percent of the increase in health insurance coverage since 2013 is due to the ACA.

"The Importance of the Meaning and Measurement of ""Affordable"" in the Affordable Care Act","This paper focuses on the practical importance of a critical but under-explored interpretation of a provision in the Affordable Care Act (ACA): whether ""affordable"" refers to the cost of single coverage alone, or to family or single coverage as applicable to the worker, in determining the employer's mandated coverage requirement and workers' (and their dependents') access to subsidized exchange coverage.Since the average annual total premium for family coverage is substantially higher than that for single coverage (on average $12,298 vs. $4,386 in 2008) this is a non-trivial distinction.Using data on workers from the Current Population Survey merged with estimates of employer and exchange policy premiums, we investigate the impact of the affordability decision on the fraction of workers who could then access exchange coverage subsidies and on the correspondingly lower employer sponsored insurance (ESI) coverage rates.We do via a series of calculations for each worker that first shows the financial incentives at stake in deciding between ESI and subsidized exchange coverage.We then show how many of those who stand to gain from exchange coverage could do so under the two different affordability rules and different levels of employee contributions.Finally, we show the extent to which a single affordability rule would cause low-income workers with families to fall into a ""no-man's land"" with no source of affordable family coverage.We estimate that choosing a family affordability rule could initially lead to as many as 1.3 million more workers accessing exchange subsidies for themselves and their families than under a single affordability rule.If employees pay 50 percent of the premiums in the future, this number increases to 6 million.Increased use of exchange subsidies would be accompanied by reductions in ESI coverage and increased costs to taxpayers.Alternatively, choosing a single affordability rule would initially result in close to 4 million dependents of workers with affordable single coverage not having affordable health insurance.This would grow to close to 13 million if employees pay 50 percent of the premium.",Kosali Simon; Richard Burkhauser; Richard V.

"Collateral, Risk Management, and the Distribution of Debt Capacity","ABSTRACT Collateral constraints imply that financing and risk management are fundamentally linked. The opportunity cost of engaging in risk management and conserving debt capacity to hedge future financing needs is forgone current investment, and is higher for more productive and less well‐capitalized firms. More constrained firms engage in less risk management and may exhaust their debt capacity and abstain from risk management, consistent with empirical evidence and in contrast to received theory. When cash flows are low, such firms may be unable to seize investment opportunities and be forced to downsize. Consequently, capital may be less productively deployed in downturns.",ADRIANO A.

A Review of Empirical Capital Structure Research and Directions for the Future,"This article reviews empirical capital structure research, concentrating on papers published since 2005. We begin by documenting three dimensions of capital structure variation: cross firm, cross industry, and within firm through time. We summarize how well the traditional trade-off and pecking order approaches explain these sources of variation and highlight their empirical shortcomings. We review recent research that attempts to address these shortcomings, much of which follows seven broad themes: (a) Important variables have been mismeasured in empirical tests, (b) the impact of leverage on nonfinancial stakeholders is important, (c) the supply side of capital affects corporate capital structure, (d) richer features of financial contracts have been underresearched, (e) value effects due to capital structure appear to be modest over wide ranges of leverage, (f) estimates of leverage adjustment speeds are biased, and (g) capital structure dynamics have not been adequately considered. Much progress has been made in addressing these issues, some of which has led to the study of an expanded range of capital structure topics, including debt maturity, loan and covenant characteristics, collateral effects, and alternative financing sources such as leasing and credit lines. We conclude by summarizing unanswered questions and areas for future research.",John R. Graham; Mark T.

The Rise of Finance Companies and FinTech Lenders in Small Business Lending,"Abstract We document that finance companies and FinTech lenders increased lending to small businesses after the 2008 financial crisis. We show that most of the increase substituted for a reduction in bank lending. In counties in which banks had a larger market share before the crisis, finance companies and FinTech lenders increased their lending more. We find no effect of reduced bank lending on employment, wages, and new business creation by 2016. Our results suggest that finance companies and FinTech lenders are major suppliers of credit to small businesses and played an important role in the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis.

"Entrepreneurship, Frictions, and Wealth","This paper constructs and calibrates a parsimonious model of occupational choice that allows for entrepreneurial entry, exit, and investment decisions in the presence of borrowing constraints. The model fits very well a number of empirical observations, including the observed wealth distribution for entrepreneurs and workers. At the aggregate level, more restrictive borrowing constraints generate less wealth concentration and reduce average firm size, aggregate capital, and the fraction of entrepreneurs. Voluntary bequests allow some high‐ability workers to establish or enlarge an entrepreneurial activity. With accidental bequests only, there would be fewer very large firms and less aggregate capital and wealth concentration.",Marco Cagetti; Mariacristina De Nardi,,,,,,,,,,,,2006.0,https://doi.org/10.1086/508032,"Entrepreneurship, Capital (architecture), Investment (military), Economics, Aggregate (composite), Distribution (mathematics), Labour economics, Distribution of wealth, Microeconomics, Monetary economics, Finance, Inequality, History, Mathematical analysis, Materials science, Mathematics, Archaeology, Politics, Political science, Law, Composite material",National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve; Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago,"Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, National Bureau of Economic Research, and University of Minnesota; Board of Governors, Federal Reserve System","Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, National Bureau of Economic Research, and University of Minnesota; Board of Governors, Federal Reserve System"
Counterproductive Sustainable Investing: The Impact Elasticity of Brown and Green Firms,"We develop a new measure of impact elasticity, defined as a firm's change in environmental impact due to a change in its cost of financing. We show empirically that a reduction in financing costs for firms that are already green leads to small improvements in impact at best. In contrast, increasing financing costs for brown firms leads to large negative changes in firm impact. Thus, sustainable investing that directs capital away from brown firms and toward green firms may counterproductive, in that it makes brown firms more brown without making green firms more green.

Financial Development and Economic Growth: Views and Agenda,"No AccessPolicy Research Working Papers21 Jun 2013Financial Development and Economic Growth: Views and AgendaAuthors/Editors: Ross LevineRoss Levinehttps://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-1678SectionsAboutPDF (3.4 MB) ToolsAdd to favoritesDownload CitationsTrack Citations ShareFacebookTwitterLinked In Abstract:October 1996 A growing body of theoretical and empirical work would push even skeptics toward the belief that the development of financial markets and institutions is critical to economic growth, rather than a sideshow or a passive response to growth. Levine argues that the preponderance of theoretical reasoning and empirical evidence suggests a positive, first-order relationship between financial development and economic growth. There is even evidence that the level of financial development is a good predictor of future rates of economic growth, capital accumulation, and technological change. Moreover, cross-country, case-study, industry-level, and firm-level analyses document extensive periods when financial development (or the lack thereof) crucially affects the speed and pattern of economic development. Levine explains what the financial system does and how it affects, and is affected by, economic growth. Theory suggests that financial instruments, markets, and institutions arise to mitigate the effects of information and transaction costs. A growing literature shows that differences in how well financial systems reduce information and transaction costs influence savings rates, investment decisions, technological innovation, and long-run growth rates. A less developed theoretical literature shows how changes in economic activity can influence financial systems. Without minimizing the role of institutions, Levine advocates a functional approach to understanding the role of financial systems in economic growth. This approach focuses on the ties between growth and the quality of the functions provided by the financial system. Levine discourages a narrow focus on one financial instrument, such as money, or a particular institution, such as banks. Instead, he addresses the more comprehensive, and difficult, question: What is the relationship between financial structure and the functioning of the financial system? More research is needed on financial development. Why does financial structure change as countries grow, for example? Why do countries at similar stages of economic development have different looking financial systems? Are there long-run economic growth advantages to adopting legal and policy changes that create one type of financial structure rather than another?

"Separations, Sorting, and Cyclical Unemployment","This paper establishes a new fact about the compositional changes in the pool of unemployed over the US business cycle. Using microdata from the Current Population Survey for the years 1962–2012, it documents that in recessions the pool of unemployed shifts toward workers with high wages in their previous job and that these shifts are driven by the high cyclicality of separations for high-wage workers. The paper finds that standard theories of wage setting and unemployment have difficulty in explaining these patterns and evaluates a number of alternative theories that do better in accounting for the new fact.

Wrestling Sprawl to the Ground: Defining and measuring an elusive concept,"Abstract The literature on urban sprawl confuses causes, consequences, and conditions. This article presents a conceptual definition of sprawl based on eight distinct dimensions of land use patterns: density, continuity, concentration, clustering, centrality, nuclearity mixed uses, and proximity. Sprawl is defined as a condition of land use that is represented by low values on one or more of these dimensions. Each dimension is operationally defined and tested in 13 urbanized areas. Results for six dimensions are reported for each area, and an initial comparison of the extent of sprawl in the 13 areas is provided. The test confirms the utility of the approach and suggests that a clearer conceptual and operational definition can facilitate research on the causes and consequences of sprawl.

The Role of Neighbourhood and Workplace Ethnic Contexts in the Formation of Inter-ethnic Partnerships: A Native Majority Perspective,"Although inter-ethnic encounters take place in multiple domains of daily life, ethnic intermarriage has typically been studied in relation to places of residence but rarely in relation to workplaces. Focussing on migrants is the most common approach to the study of intermarriage, whereas focussing on native majority population is less frequent. This study investigates an extent to which the share of immigrants at the workplace establishment and in the residential neighbourhood influences the natives' likelihood of choosing a foreign-born partner. The analysis is based on longitudinal register data that cover all residents of Finland in 1999-2014. We focus on native Finnish women and men born from 1981 to 1995. We estimated a discrete-time event history model with competing risks, distinguishing the first-partnership formation with a foreign-born partner and a native-born partner. The share of immigrants in the residential neighbourhood and workplace both increase the propensity of choosing a foreign-born partner, but the share of immigrants in workplace tends to have a stronger bearing on the partner choice. High exposure to other ethnic groups in one domain is associated with reduced effect of the additional exposure occurring in another domain. The effect of ethnic diversity at workplace tends to be more pronounced among women. The study contributes to the literature by examining both the independent effect of residential and workplace contexts on the formation of ethnically mixed partnership among the native majority population, as well as the interaction between the two.",Allan Puur; Leen Rahnu; Tiit Tammaru; Tom Kleinepier,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10680-019-09528-x,"Ethnic group, Neighbourhood (mathematics), Immigration, Residence, Demographic economics, Geography, Population, General partnership, Sociology, Demography, Social psychology, Psychology, Political science, Economics, Mathematical analysis, Mathematics, Archaeology, Anthropology, Law",Delft University of Technology; Tallinn University; University of Tartu,"Estonian Institute for Population Studies, Tallinn University, Tallinn, Estonia; OTB - Faculty of Architecture and Built Environment, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands; Centre for Migration and Urban Studies, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia","Estonian Institute for Population Studies, Tallinn University, Tallinn, Estonia; OTB - Faculty of Architecture and Built Environment, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands; Centre for Migration and Urban Studies, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia"
A Multiplicative Model of Optimal CEO Incentives in Market Equilibrium,"This paper presents a unified theory of both the level and sensitivity of pay in competitive market equilibrium, by embedding a moral hazard problem into a talent assignment model. By considering multiplicative specifications for the CEO's utility and production functions, we generate a number of different results from traditional additive models. First, both the CEO's low fractional ownership (the Jensen–Murphy incentives measure) and its negative relationship with firm size can be quantitatively reconciled with optimal contracting, and thus need not reflect rent extraction. Second, the dollar change in wealth for a percentage change in firm value, divided by annual pay, is independent of firm size, and therefore a desirable empirical measure of incentives. Third, incentive pay is effective at solving agency problems with multiplicative impacts on firm value, such as strategy choice. However, additive issues such as perk consumption are best addressed through direct monitoring.",Alex Edmans; Augustin Landier; Xavier Gabaix,,,,,,,,,,,,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhn117,"Incentive, Microeconomics, Economics, Multiplicative function, Consumption (sociology), Value (mathematics), Production (economics), Liberian dollar, Agency cost, Principal–agent problem, Agency (philosophy), Econometrics, Mathematics, Finance, Statistics, Social science, Corporate governance, Sociology, Philosophy, Epistemology, Mathematical analysis, Shareholder",New York University; University of Pennsylvania,"New York University & NBER; New York University.; Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania#TAB#","New York University & NBER; New York University.; Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania#TAB#"

The Flattening Firm and Product Market Competition: The Effect of Trade Liberalization on Corporate Hierarchies,"This paper establishes a causal effect of product market competition on various characteristics of organizational design. Using a unique panel dataset on firm hierarchies of large US firms (1986–1999) and a quasi-natural experiment (trade liberalization), we find that competition leads firms to flatten their hierarchies: firms reduce the number of positions between the CEO and division managers, and firms increase the number of positions reporting directly to the CEO. The results illustrate how firms redesign their organizational structure through a set of complementary choices in response to changes in their environment. We discuss several possible interpretations of these changes.

Human Capital and Productivity in a Team Environment: Evidence from the Healthcare Sector,"Using panel data from a large hospital system, this paper presents estimates of the productivity effects of human capital in a team production environment. Proxying nurses' general human capital by education and their unit-specific human capital by experience on the nursing unit, we find that greater amounts of both types of human capital significantly improve patient outcomes. Disruptions to team functioning attributable to the departure of experienced nurses, the absorption of new hires, and the inclusion of temporary contract nurses are associated with significant decreases in productivity beyond those attributable to changes in nurses' skill and experience.

Human Capital and Organizational Performance: Evidence from the Healthcare Sector,"This paper contributes to the literature on the relationship between human capital and organizational performance.We use detailed longitudinal monthly data on nursing units in the Veterans Administration hospital system to identify how the human capital (general, hospital-specific and unit or team-specific) of the nursing team on the unit affects patients' outcomes.Since we use monthly, not annual, data, we are able to avoid the omitted variable bias and endogeneity bias that could result when annual data are used.Nurse staffing levels, general human capital, and unit-specific human capital have positive and significant effects on patient outcomes while the use of contract nurses, who have less specific capital than regular staff nurses, negatively impacts patient outcomes.Policies that would increase the specific human capital of the nursing staff are found to be cost-effective.",Ann Bartel; Ann P.

Earnings Inequality and Coordination Costs: Evidence from U.S. Law Firms,"Earnings inequality has increased substantially since the 1970s. Using evidence from confidential Census data on U.S. law offices on lawyers’ organization and earnings, we study the extent to which the mechanism suggested by Lucas (1978) and Rosen (1982), a scale of operations effect linking spans of control and earnings inequality, is responsible for increases in inequality. We first show that earnings inequality among lawyers increased substantially between 1977 and 1992, and that the distribution of partner-associate ratios across offices changed in ways consistent with the hypothesis that coordination costs fell during this period. We then propose a 'hierarchical production function' in which output is the product of skill and time and estimate its parameters, applying insights from the equilibrium assignment literature. We find that coordination costs fell broadly and steadily during this period, so that hiring one’s first associate leveraged a partner’s skill by about 30% more in 1992 than 1977. We find also that changes in lawyers’ hierarchical organization account for about 2/3 of the increase in earnings inequality among lawyers in the upper tail, but a much smaller share of the increase in inequality between lawyers in the upper tail and other lawyers. These findings indicate that new organizational efficiencies potentially explain increases in inequality, especially among individuals toward the top of the earnings distribution.",Luis Garicano; Thomas N.

It's the Market: The Broad-Based Rise in the Return to Top Talent,"One explanation that has been proposed for rising inequality is that technical change allows highly talented individuals, or “superstars” to manage or perform on a larger scale, applying their talent to greater pools of resources and reaching larger numbers of people, thus becoming more productive and higher paid. Others argue that managerial power has increased in a way that allows those at the top to receive higher pay, that social norms against higher pay levels have broken down, or that tax policy affects the distribution of surpluses between employers and employees. We offer evidence bearing on the different theories explaining the rise in inequality in the United States over recent decades. First we look the increase in pay at the highest income levels across occupations. We consider the income share of the top 1 percent over time. And we turn to evidence on inequality of wealth at the top. In looking at the wealthiest Americans, we find that those in the Forbes 400 are less likely to have inherited their wealth or to have grown up wealthy. The Forbes 400 of today also are those who were able to access education while young and apply their skills to the most scalable industries: technology, finance, and mass retail. We believe that the US evidence on income and wealth shares for the top 1 percent is most consistent with a “superstar”-style explanation rooted in the importance of scale and skill-biased technological change. It is less consistent with an argument that the gains to the top 1 percent are rooted in greater managerial power or changes in social norms about what managers should earn.",Joshua Rauh; Steven N Kaplan; Steven N.

Knowledge-Based Hierarchies: Using Organizations to Understand the Economy,"Incorporating the decision of how to organize the acquisition, use, and communication of knowledge into economic models is essential to understand a wide variety of economic phenomena. We survey the literature that has used knowledge-based hierarchies to study issues such as the evolution of wage inequality, the growth and productivity of firms, economic development, and the gains from international trade, as well as offshoring and the formation of international production teams. We also review the nascent empirical literature that has, so far, confirmed the importance of organizational decisions and many of their more salient implications.",Esteban Rossi-Hansberg; Esteban Rossi‐Hansberg; Luis Garicano,,,,,,,,,,,,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115748,"Variety (cybernetics), Salient, Offshoring, Productivity, Production (economics), Economics, Industrial organization, Business, Knowledge management, Knowledge economy, Microeconomics, Marketing, Computer science, Outsourcing, Economic growth, Economy, Artificial intelligence",National Bureau of Economic Research; Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars; Princeton University,"Department of Economics and Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544-1021;;  National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)","Department of Economics and Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544-1021;;  National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)"
Decoding team and individual impact in science and invention,"Scientists and inventors increasingly work in teams, raising fundamental questions about the nature of team production and making individual assessment increasingly difficult. Here we present a method for describing individual and team citation impact that both is computationally feasible and can be applied in standard, wide-scale databases. We track individuals across collaboration networks to define an individual citation index and examine outcomes when each individual works alone or in teams. Studying 24 million research articles and 3.9 million US patents, we find a substantial impact advantage of teamwork over solo work. However, this advantage declines as differences between the team members’ individual citation indices grow. Team impact is predicted more by the lower-citation rather than the higher-citation team members, typically centering near the harmonic average of the individual citation indices. Consistent with this finding, teams tend to assemble among individuals with similar citation impact in all fields of science and patenting. In assessing individuals, our index, which accounts for each coauthor, is shown to have substantial advantages over existing measures. First, it more accurately predicts out-of-sample paper and patent outcomes. Second, it more accurately characterizes which scholars are elected to the National Academy of Sciences. Overall, the methodology uncovers universal regularities that inform team organization while also providing a tool for individual evaluation in the team production era.",Benjamin F.

Optimal Contracting and the Organization of Knowledge,"We study contractual arrangements that support an efficient use of time in a knowledge-intensive economy in which agents endogenously specialize in either production or consulting. The resulting market for advice is plagued by informational problems, since both the difficulty of the questions posed to consultants and the knowledge of those consultants are hard to assess. We show that spot contracting is not efficient because lemons (in this case, self-employed producers with intermediate knowledge) cannot be appropriately excluded from the market. However, an ex ante, firm-like contractual arrangement uniquely delivers the first best. This arrangement involves hierarchies in which consultants are full residual claimants of output and compensate producers via incentive contracts. This simple characterization of the optimal ex ante arrangement suggests a rationale for the organization of firms and the structure of compensation in knowledge-intensive sectors. Our findings correspond empirically to observed arrangements inside professional service firms and between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs.",L. Garicano; L. Rayo; Luis Garicano; Luis Rayo; W.

A Description and Analysis of Evolving Data Resources on Small Business,"This paper describes the main government and private data sources currently available or under construction for research on small business and entrepreneurship. It also provides a listing of resources researchers can use to gain more information about each data set. Of particular importance are new longitudinal data sets created by the Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics, which allow for the study of business entry and exit (which is especially relevant to small business policy) as well as changes within establishments and firms to be studied over time. The most notable gap in current small business data sources is the lack of a publicly available source of longitudinal data. In the next five years, this gap will be at least partially addressed by the Kauffman Firm Survey of new businesses. Information on this survey design and instrument is available now and researchers can begin to design research studies that would take advantage of the data when they become available.",Amelia Haviland; Amelia M.

How Debit Cards Enable the Poor to Save More,"ABSTRACT We study an at‐scale natural experiment in which debit cards were given to cash transfer recipients who already had a bank account. Using administrative account data and household surveys, we find that beneficiaries accumulated a savings stock equal to 2% of annual income after two years with the card. The increase in formal savings represents an increase in overall savings, financed by a reduction in current consumption. There are two mechanisms. First, debit cards reduce transaction costs of accessing money. Second, they reduce monitoring costs, which led beneficiaries to check their account balances frequently and build trust in the bank.",ENRIQUE SEIRA; Enrique Seira; PAUL GERTLER; PIERRE BACHAS; Paul Gertler; Pierre Bachas; SEAN HIGGINS; Sean Higgins,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13021,"Debit card, ATM card, Business, Cash, Bank account, Transfer (computing), Consumption (sociology), Stock (firearms), Payment, Database transaction, Savings account, Finance, Credit card, Economics, Computer science, Database, Geography, Social science, Sociology, Parallel computing, Archaeology","National Bureau of Economic Research; Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México; University of California, Berkeley","Princeton Economics Department Office 214 Princeton, NJ 08542; Haas School of Business University of California, Berkeley Berkeley, CA 94720 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Centro de Investigación Económica ITAM Ave. Santa Teresa # 930 Mexico; School of Business University of California, Berkeley Berkeley, CA 94720","Princeton Economics Department Office 214 Princeton, NJ 08542; Haas School of Business University of California, Berkeley Berkeley, CA 94720 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Centro de Investigación Económica ITAM Ave. Santa Teresa # 930 Mexico; School of Business University of California, Berkeley Berkeley, CA 94720"

The euroization of bank deposits in Eastern Europe,"In Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe a substantial share of bank deposits are denominated in foreign currency. Deposit euroization poses key challenges for monetary policy and financial sector supervision. On the one hand, it limits the effectiveness of monetary policy interventions. On the other hand, it increases financial sector fragility by exposing banks to currency risk or currency-induced credit risk. Policymakers disagree on whether countries in the region should tackle deposit euroization with ‘dedollarization’ policies or should rather strive to adopt the Euro as their legal tender. Assessing the potential effectiveness of ‘dedollarization’ policies requires a clear understanding of which households hold foreign currency deposits and why they do so. On the basis of survey data covering 16,375 households in ten countries in 2011 and 2012, we provide a comprehensive household-level analysis of deposit euroization in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe. We examine how households’ preferences for, and holding of, foreign currency deposits are related to individual expectations about monetary conditions and network effects. We also examine to what extent monetary expectations and deposit euroization are the legacy of past financial crises or the outflow of current policies and institutions in the region. Our findings suggest that deposit euroization in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe can be partly tackled by prudent monetary and economic decisions by today’s policymakers. The preferences of households for Euro deposits are partly driven by their distrust in the stability of their domestic currency, which in turn is related to their assessment of current policies and institutions. However, our findings also suggest that a stable monetary policy may not be sufficient to deal with the hysteresis of deposit euroization across the region. First, we confirm that the holding of foreign currency deposits has become a ‘habit’ in the region. Second, we find that deposit euroization is still strongly influenced by households’ experiences of financial crises in the 1990s. Our findings question the effectiveness of supply side interventions (e.g. bank regulation) or demand side interventions (e.g. local currency capital market development) in de-euroizing household savings. First, we show that deposit euroization is largely demand driven. Second, we show that households already have access to a broad range of savings products in local currency.",Helmut Stix; Martin Brown,,,,,,,,,,,,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/epolic/eiu002,"Currency, Monetary policy, Economics, Business, Currency substitution, Financial system, Foreign-exchange reserves, International economics, Monetary economics, Foreign exchange risk",National Bank of Austria; Swiss Finance Institute; University of St. Gallen," Swiss Institute of Banking and Finance, University of St. Gallen, Rosenbergstr. 52, CH-9000 St. Gallen.;  Economic Studies Division, Oesterreichische Nationalbank, POB 61, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.; Design Communications and Publications Division; Oesterreichische Nationalbank Otto-Wagner-Platz 3, 1090 Vienna, Austria PO Box 61, 1011 Vienna, Austria www."," Swiss Institute of Banking and Finance, University of St. Gallen, Rosenbergstr. 52, CH-9000 St. Gallen.;  Economic Studies Division, Oesterreichische Nationalbank, POB 61, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.; Design Communications and Publications Division; Oesterreichische Nationalbank Otto-Wagner-Platz 3, 1090 Vienna, Austria PO Box 61, 1011 Vienna, Austria www."

The Value of Brownfield Remediation,"The US Environmental Protection Agency Brownfields Program awards grants to redevelop contaminated lands known as brownfields. This paper estimates cleanup benefits by combining administrative records for a nationally representative sample of brownfields with high-resolution, high-frequency housing data. With cleanup, we find that property values increase by an average of 5.0% to 11.5%. For a welfare interpretation that does not rely on the intertemporal stability of the hedonic price function, a double-difference matching estimator finds even larger effects of up to 15.2%. Our various specifications lead to the consistent conclusion that Brownfields Program cleanups yield positive, statistically significant, but highly localized effects on housing prices.",Christopher Timmins; Kevin Haninger; Lala Ma,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1086/689743,"Brownfield, Property value, Agency (philosophy), Yield (engineering), Value (mathematics), Matching (statistics), Sample (material), Economics, Business, Actuarial science, Engineering, Finance, Civil engineering, Statistics, Mathematics, Redevelopment, Real estate, Philosophy, Materials science, Chemistry, Epistemology, Chromatography, Metallurgy",Environmental Protection Agency; Duke University; University of Kentucky; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Department of Economics Duke University 209 Social Sciences Building P.O.

Toxic Assets: How the Housing Market Responds to Environmental Information Shocks,"<h3>Abstract</h3> Employing national microdata from Zillow, we examine how United States housing markets respond to expanded information on local pollution stemming from a 1998 reporting change to the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). Using both a difference-in-differences and a regression discontinuity in time design, we find news coverage of the new TRI data lowered sales prices of homes near the largest reporting polluters, but only within a tight geographic distance. Effects are isolated to homes within 0.5 miles of facilities reporting the largest amount of emissions (&gt;100 tons). This price capitalization implies public information on local polluters shifted private market behavior, suggesting a role for government as provider of information.",Jeremy G. Moulton; Nicholas J.

Hedonic Prices and Implicit Markets: Estimating Marginal Willingness to Pay for Differentiated Products Without Instrumental Variables,"The hedonic model of Rosen (1974) has become a workhorse for valuing the characteristics of differentiated products despite a number of well-documented econometric problems.For example, Bartik (1987) and Epple (1987) each describe a source of endogeneity in the second stage of Rosen's procedure that has proven difficult to overcome.In this paper, we propose a new approach for recovering the marginal willingness-to-pay function that altogether avoids these endogeneity problems.Applying this estimator to data on large changes in violent crime rates, we find that marginal willingness-to-pay increases by ten cents with each additional violent crime per 100,000 residents.",Christopher Timmins; Kelly Bishop,,,,,,,,,,,,2011.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w17611,"Willingness to pay, Instrumental variable, Economics, Econometrics, Microeconomics",National Bureau of Economic Research; Duke University; Washington University in St. Louis,"Department of Economics Duke University 209 Social Sciences Building P.O.

Management of Hazardous Waste and Contaminated Land,"Regulation of hazardous waste and cleanup of contaminated sites are two major components of modern public policy for environmental protection. We review the literature on these related areas, with emphasis on empirical analyses. Researchers have identified many behavioral responses to regulation of hazardous waste, including changes in the location of economic activity. However, the drivers behind compliance with these costly regulations remain a puzzle, as most research suggests a limited role for conventional enforcement. Increasingly sophisticated research examines the benefits of cleanup of contaminated sites, yet controversy remains about whether the benefits of cleanup in the United States exceed its costs. Finally, research focusing on the imposition of legal liability for damages from hazardous waste finds advantages and disadvantages of the U.S. reliance on legal liability to pay for cleanup, as opposed to the government-financed approaches more common in Europe.",Hilary Sigman; Sarah L.

Difference-in-Differences Hedonics,"Cross-sectional estimates of hedonic price functions theoretically recover marginal values for characteristics but face endogeneity problems. Consequently, economists have introduced difference-in-differences and other quasi-experimental econometric methods into hedonic models. Unfortunately, the welfare interpretation of these estimands has not been clear. This paper shows that quasi-experimental hedonics can identify the movement along the ex post price function. It further shows that this effect is a lower bound on general equilibrium welfare. Thus, nonmarginal welfare can be recovered using transparent designs without Rosen’s second stage or more structural models. The paper illustrates these results with an application to toxic facilities and housing prices.",H.

Capitalization of Targeted Property Tax Relief in Home Prices: Evidence from Virginia Elections,"This study examines the market impact of targeted property tax relief, which is critical for understanding who exactly benefits from a widely used local policy. Specifically, we investigate this in the context of two state-wide ballot measures in Virginia that provided property tax relief intended to aid seniors and disabled veterans. Using residential MLS microdata from Virginia, results from a regression discontinuity analysis show that once the 2010 tax relief measures passed on Election Day, property values rose sharply in response to the sudden increase in demand for homeownership among the targeted groups. As part of our identification strategy, we find that “senior preferred” housing as well as areas with higher proportions of seniors and veterans experienced the highest price appreciation, while areas with fewer veterans or seniors saw little impact. Further, we explore numerous alternative hypotheses and specifications that might explain this discontinuity. The findings suggest that this type of policy provides an immediate benefit to current homeowners, thereby offsetting benefits for subsequent homeowners within the targeted groups. This effect represents an unintended consequence of targeted property tax relief as a (very popular) policy tool more generally, as an immediate capitalization into home prices subsequently increases the cost of housing for many individuals the relief was intended to help.",Bennie D.

Policy Uncertainty In Japan,"We develop new economic policy uncertainty (EPU) indices for Japan from January 1987 onwards, building on Baker, Bloom and Davis (2016).Each index reflects the frequency of newspaper articles that contain certain terms pertaining to the economy, policy matters, and uncertainty.Our overall EPU index co-varies positively with implied volatilities for Japanese equities, exchange rates, and interest rates and with a survey-based measure of political uncertainty.It rises around contested national elections and major leadership transitions in Japan, during the Asian financial crisis and in reaction to the Lehman Brothers failure, U.S. debt downgrade in 2011, Brexit referendum, the deferral of a consumption tax hike, and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.Our uncertainty indices for fiscal, monetary, trade, and exchange rate policy co-vary positively but also display distinct dynamics.For example, our trade policy uncertainty (TPU) index rocketed upwards when the U.S. withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.VAR models imply that upward EPU innovations foreshadow deteriorations in Japan's macroeconomic performance, as reflected by impulse response functions for investment, employment, and output.Our study adds to evidence that credible policy plans and strong policy frameworks can favorably influence macroeconomic performance by reducing policy uncertainty.",Arata Ito; Elif Arbatli; Naoko Miake; Steven Davis; Steven J.

An Instrumental Variable Approach to Dynamic Models,"We present a new class of methods for identification and inference in dynamicmodels with serially correlated unobservables, which typically imply that state variablesare econometrically endogenous. In the context of Industrial Organization, these statevariables often reflect econometrically endogenous market structure. We propose theuse of Generalized Instrument Variables methods to identify those dynamic policyfunctions that are consistent with instrumental variable (IV) restrictions. Extendingpopular “two-step” methods, these policy functions then identify a set of structuralparameters that are consistent with the dynamic model, the IV restrictions and thedata.

"Horizontal Mergers, Prices, and Productivity","I estimate the price and productivity effects of horizontal mergers in the ready-mix concrete industry using plant and firm-level data from the US Census Bureau. Horizontal mergers involving plants in close proximity are associated with price increases and decreases in output, but also raise productivity at acquired plants. While there is a significant negative relationship between productivity and prices, the rate at which productivity reduces price is modest and the effects of increased market power are not offset. I then present several additional new results of policy interest. For example, mergers are only observed leading to price increases after the relaxation of antitrust standards in the mid-1980s; price increases following mergers are persistent but tend to become smaller over time; and, there is evidence that firms target plants charging below average prices for acquisition. Finally, I use a simple multinomial logit demand model to assess the effects of merger activity on total welfare. At acquired plants, the consumer and producer surplus effects approximately cancel out, but effects at acquiring plants and non-merging plants, where prices also rise, cause a substantial decrease in consumer surplus.",Robert B.

Patents and the Global Diffusion of New Drugs,"Analysis of the timing of launches of 642 new drugs in 76 countries during 1983–2002 shows that patent and price regulation regimes strongly affect how quickly new drugs become commercially available in different countries. Price regulation delays launch, while longer and more extensive patent rights accelerate it. Health policy institutions and economic and demographic factors that make markets more profitable also speed up diffusion. The estimated effects are generally robust to controlling for endogeneity of policy regimes with country fixed effects and instrumental variables. The results highlight the important role of policy choices in driving the diffusion of new innovations.",Iain Cockburn; Iain M. Cockburn; Jean O.

"Entry, exit, and the determinants of market structure","This article estimates a dynamic, structural model of entry and exit for two US service industries: dentists and chiropractors. Entry costs faced by potential entrants, fixed costs faced by incumbent producers, and the toughness of short‐run price competition are important determinants of long‐run firm values, firm turnover, and market structure. In the dentist industry entry costs were subsidized in geographic markets designated as Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSA) and the estimated mean entry cost is 11 percent lower in these markets. Using simulations, we find that entry cost subsidies are less expensive per additional firm than fixed cost subsidies.",Daniel Yi Xu; Mark J. Roberts; Shawn D.

Detection and Impact of Industrial Subsidies: The Case of Chinese Shipbuilding,"This article provides a model-based empirical strategy to, (1) detect the presence and gauge the magnitude of government subsidies and (2) quantify their impact on production reallocation across countries, industry prices, costs and consumer surplus. I construct and estimate an industry model that allows for dynamic agents in both demand and supply and apply my strategy to world shipbuilding, a classic target of industrial policy. I find strong evidence consistent with China having intervened and reducing shipyard costs by |$13$|–|$20\%$|⁠, corresponding to |$1.5$| to |$4.5$| billion US dollars, between 2006 and 2012. The subsidies led to substantial reallocation of ship production across the world, with Japan, in particular, losing significant market share.

Estimation of Dynamic Discrete Choice Models in Continuous Time with an Application to Retail Competition,"This article develops a dynamic model of retail competition and uses it to study the impact of the expansion of a new national competitor on the structure of urban markets. In order to accommodate substantial heterogeneity (both observed and unobserved) across agents and markets, the article first develops a general framework for estimating and solving dynamic discrete choice models in continuous time that is computationally light and readily applicable to dynamic games. In the proposed framework, players face a standard dynamic discrete choice problem at decision times that occur stochastically. The resulting stochastic-sequential structure naturally admits the use of conditional choice probability methods for estimation and makes it possible to compute counterfactual simulations for relatively high-dimensional games. The model and method are applied to the retail grocery industry, into which Walmart began rapidly expanding in the early 1990s, eventually attaining a dominant position. We find that Walmart's expansion into groceries came mostly at the expense of the large incumbent supermarket chains, rather than the single-store outlets that bore the brunt of its earlier conquest of the broader general merchandise sector. Instead, we find that independent grocers actually thrive when Walmart enters, leading to an overall reduction in market concentration. These competitive effects are strongest in larger markets and those into which Walmart expanded most rapidly, suggesting a diminishing role of scale and a greater emphasis on differentiation in this previously mature industry.",Jason R.

Markov Perfect Industry Dynamics with Many Firms,"We propose an approximation method for analyzing Ericson and Pakes (1995)-style dynamic models of imperfect competition.We develop a simple algorithm for computing an ``oblivious equilibrium,'' in which each firm is assumed to make decisions based only on its own state and knowledge of the long run average industry state, but where firms ignore current information about competitors' states.We prove that, as the market becomes large, if the equilibrium distribution of firm states obeys a certain ``light-tail'' condition, then oblivious equilibria closely approximate Markov perfect equilibria.We develop bounds that can be computed to assess the accuracy of the approximation for any given applied problem.Through computational experiments, we find that the method often generates useful approximations for industries with hundreds of firms and in some cases even tens of firms.",Ben Van Roy; C.

Productivity Volatility and the Misallocation of Resources in Developing Economies,"We investigate the role of dynamic production inputs and their associated adjustment costs in shaping the dispersion of total factor productivity (TFP) and static measures of capital misallocation within a country.Using data on 5,010 establishments in 33 developing countries from the World Bank's Enterprise Research Data, we find that countries exhibiting greater time-series volatility of productivity are also characterized by greater cross-sectional dispersion in productivity.Volatility in TFP explains one quarter to one third of cross-country productivity dispersion.We document a similar relationship between productivity volatility and the dispersion of the marginal revenue product of capital (static capital misallocation).We then use a standard model of investment with adjustment costs, parameterized using numbers calibrated to U.S. data, to show that increasing the volatility of productivity to the level observed in these developing economies can quantitatively replicate the observed relationship between static misallocation and volatility observed in the data.We find that sixty-one percent of the static capital misallocation in the data is captured by the model's prediction.Our findings suggest that the dynamic process governing productivity shocks is a first-order determinant of differences in misallocation and, hence, income across countries.",Allan Collard-Wexler; Allan Collard‐Wexler; Jan De Loecker; John Asker,,,,,,,,,,,,2011.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w17175,"Volatility (finance), Economics, Productivity, Monetary economics, Natural resource economics, International economics, Business, Economy, Macroeconomics, Financial economics",National Bureau of Economic Research; New York University; Princeton University,"School of Business Department of Economics, Suite 7-79 New York University 44 West 4th Street New York, NY 10012 and; School of Business New York University 44 West Fourth Street KMC-7-80 New York, NY 10012 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics 307 Fisher Hall Princeton University Princeton, NJ 08544-1021 and","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; School of Business New York University 44 West Fourth Street KMC-7-80 New York, NY 10012 and; School of Business Department of Economics, Suite 7-79 New York University 44 West 4th Street New York, NY 10012 and; Department of Economics 307 Fisher Hall Princeton University Princeton, NJ 08544-1021 and"
Demand Conditions and Worker Safety: Evidence from Price Shocks in Mining,"We investigate how demand conditions affect employers' provision of safety—something about which theory is ambivalent. Positive demand shocks relax financial constraints that limit safety investment but simultaneously raise the opportunity cost of increasing safety rather than production. We study the US metals mining sector, leveraging exogenous demand shocks from short-term variation in global commodity prices. We find that positive price shocks substantially increase workplace injury rates and safety regulation noncompliance. While these results indicate the general dominance of the opportunity cost effect, shocks that only increase mines' cash flow lower injury rates, illustrating that financial constraints also affect safety.",Do Lee; Do Q.

Evidence and Lessons on the Health Impacts of Public Health Funding from the Fight against HIV/AIDS,"HIV/AIDS has been one of the largest public health crises in recent history, and the US federal government has spent hundreds of billions of dollars fighting the disease. This study examines the impact of the large amounts of federal funding allocated to US cities to combat HIV/AIDS through the Ryan White CARE Act’s first title. The findings indicate that the cost to avoid an HIV/AIDS death through the program is roughly $334,000, that the program has saved approximately 57,000 lives through 2018, and that funding disparities are responsible for the uneven progress in combating HIV/AIDS across the United States.

The Heterogeneous Value of a Statistical Life: Evidence from U.S. Army Reenlistment Decisions,"This paper estimates the value of a statistical life (VSL), or the willingness to trade-off wealth and mortality risk, among 430,000 U.S. Army soldiers choosing whether to reenlist between 2002 and 2010. Using a discrete choice random utility approach and significant variation in retention bonuses and mortality risk, we recover average VSL estimates that range between $500,000 and $900,000, an order of magnitude smaller than U.S. civilian labor market estimates. Additionally, we fulfill Rosen's (1974) vision to recover indifference curves between wealth and non-market goods (e.g., mortality risk) and document substantial heterogeneity in preferences within and across types. We find the VSL increases rapidly with mortality risk within type, and that soldiers in combat occupations have much lower VSLs than those in noncombat occupations. We estimate that the quadrupling of mortality risk from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars reduced annual welfare by $2,355 per soldier, roughly 8 percent of pay.",Kyle Greenberg; Michael Greenstone; Michael Yankovich; Stephen G.

Quasi-Experimental Shift-Share Research Designs,"Many studies use shift-share (or ""Bartik"") instruments, which average a set of shocks with exposure share weights. We provide a new econometric framework for shift-share instrumental variable (SSIV) regressions in which identification follows from the quasi-random assignment of shocks, while exposure shares are allowed to be endogenous. The framework is motivated by an equivalence result: the orthogonality between a shift-share instrument and an unobserved residual can be represented as the orthogonality between the underlying shocks and a shock-level unobservable. SSIV regression coefficients can similarly be obtained from an equivalent shock-level regression, motivating shock-level conditions for their consistency. We discuss and illustrate several practical insights of this framework in the setting of Autor et al.

"Demand Shifts, Population Adjustments, and Labor Market Outcomes during the 1980s","In this article we explore the effects of labor demand shifts and population adjustments across metropolitan areas on the employment and earnings of various demographic groups during the 1980s. We find that population shifts across areas at least partially offset the effects of these demand shifts, but less‐educated workers showed substantially lower population adjustments in response to these demand shifts.

Urban growth and housing supply,"Cities are physical structures, but the modern literature on urban economic development rarely acknowledges that fact. The elasticity of housing supply helps determine the extent to which increases in productivity will create bigger cities or just higher paid workers and more expensive homes. In this article, we present a simple model that provides a framework for doing empirical work that integrates the heterogeneity of housing supply into urban development. Empirical analysis yields results consistent with the implications of the model that differences in the nature of house supply across space are not only responsible for higher housing prices, but also affect how cities respond to increases in productivity.",Edward L.

Rather than aggregate shared characteristics into a single network matrix, we specify additively separate network matrices for each shared characteristic and estimate city-wide peer effects for each one.

Identifying Individual and Group Effects in the Presence of Sorting: A Neighborhood Effects Application,"Researchers have long recognized that the non-random sorting of individuals into groups generates correlation between individual and group attributes that is likely to bias naïve estimates of both individual and group effects.This paper proposes a non-parametric strategy for identifying these effects in a model that allows for both individual and group unobservables, applying this strategy to the estimation of neighborhood effects on labor market outcomes.The first part of this strategy is guided by a robust feature of the equilibrium in vertical sorting models -a monotonic relationship between neighborhood housing prices and neighborhood quality.This implies that under certain conditions a non-parametric function of neighborhood housing prices serves as a suitable control function for the neighborhood unobservable in the labor market outcome regression.This control function transforms the problem to a model with one unobservable so that traditional instrumental variables solutions may be applied.In our application, we instrument for each individual's observed neighborhood attributes with the average neighborhood attributes of a set of observationally identical individuals.The neighborhood effects model is estimated using confidential microdata from the 1990 Decennial Census for the Boston MSA.The results imply that the direct effects of geographic proximity to jobs, neighborhood poverty rates, and average neighborhood education are substantially larger than the conditional correlations identified using OLS, although the net effect of neighborhood quality on labor market outcomes remains small.These findings are robust across a wide variety of specifications and robustness checks.",Patrick Bayer; Stephen L.

"Spatial Sorting: Why New York, Los Angeles and Detroit Attract the Greatest Minds as Well as the Unskilled","We propose a theory of skill mobility across cities. It predicts the well documented city size-wage premium: the wage distribution in large cities first-order stochastically dominates that in small cities. Yet, because this premium is reflected in higher house prices, this does not necessarily imply that this stochastic dominance relation also exists in the distribution of skills. Instead, we find there is second-order stochastic dominance in the skill distribution. The demand for skills is non-monotonic as our model predicts a ""Sinatra"" as well as an ""Eminem"" effect: both the very high and the very low skilled disproportionately sort into the biggest cities, while those with medium skill levels sort into small cities. The pattern of spatial sorting is explained by a technology with a varying elasticity of substitution that is decreasing in skill density. Using CPS data on wages and Census data on house prices, we find that this technology is consistent with the observed patterns of skills.",Jan Eeckhout; Kurt Schmidheiny; Roberto Pinheiro,,,,,,,,,,,,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1724583,"Sorting, Economic geography, Sociology, Cartography, Geography, Computer science, Programming language",University of Basel; University College London; Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland,University College London - Department of Economics; Federal Reserve Banks - Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland; Universität Basel,University College London - Department of Economics; Federal Reserve Banks - Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland; Universität Basel
Estimating the Effects of Friendship Networks on Health Behaviors of Adolescents,"This paper estimates the effects of friends' health behaviors, smoking and drinking, on own health behaviors for adolescents while controlling for the effects of correlated unobservables between those friends.Specifically, the effect of friends' health behaviors is identified by comparing similar individuals who have the same friendship opportunities because they attend the same school and make similar friendship choices, under the assumption that the friendship choice reveals information about an individual's unobservables.We combine this identification strategy with a cross-cohort, within school design so that the model is identified based on across grade differences in the clustering of health behaviors within specific friendship patterns.Finally, we use the estimated information on correlated unobservables to examine longitudinal data on the on-set of health behaviors, where the opportunity for reverse causality should be minimal.Our estimates for both behavior and on-set are very robust to bias from correlated unobservables.",Jason Fletcher; Jason M.

Labor Market Effects of Payroll Taxes in Developing Countries: Evidence from Colombia,"We use a panel of manufacturing plants from Colombia to analyze how the rise in payroll tax rates over the 1980s and 1990s affected the labor market. Our estimates indicate that formal wages fall by between 1.4% and 2.3% as a result of a 10% rise in payroll taxes. This ""less‐than‐full shifting"" is likely to be the result of weak linkages between benefits and taxes and the presence of downward wage rigidities in Colombia. Because the costs of taxation are only partly shifted from employers to employees, employment also falls. Our results indicate that a 10% increase in payroll taxes lowered formal employment by between 4% and 5%. In addition, we find some evidence of less shifting and larger disemployment effects for production than for nonproduction workers. These results suggest that policies aimed at boosting the relative demand of less skilled workers by reducing social security taxes may be effective in Latin American countries, where minimum wages bind and benefits are often not directly linked to contributions.",Adriana D.

Chilean Pension Reform: Coverage Facts and Policy Alternatives,"Chilean Pension Reform: Coverage Facts and Policy Alternatives Solange Berstein Guillermo Larraín Francisco Pino [Comments] The Chilean pension reform has given rise to significant debate in the last decade. It was the first pension system in which the core mechanism for producing pensions is individual capitalization and the first to hand over its management to the private sector. This pension concept is one of the rare institutions exported from Chile to the rest of the world, including countries in Latin America, central and eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia, as well as a few developed countries such as Sweden. A quarter of a century after its inception, it seems natural to undertake a deep evaluation of the system's outcomes, strengths, and weaknesses. Corbo and Schmidt-Hebbel make a positive macroeconomic assessment, as well as good evaluation on financial grounds based on the high average return on assets.1 Several papers, however, argue that the level of competition is weak, which translates into high prices and high returns on equity.2 From a public finance perspective, Arenas suggests that the fiscal burden may be significant and increasing, while the average coverage ratio appears to be low.3 Finally, in an earlier paper, we undertake a preliminary evaluation of coverage based on affiliates' administrative data.4 These last two [End Page 227] studies reveal that one of the main weaknesses of the Chilean model is its low coverage.5 This paper studies the reasons behind the low coverage of the Chilean pension system by focusing on one benefit—namely, old-age pensions. It departs from previous studies in that it uses individual data from administrative records, as well as socioeconomic characterization of these same individuals provided by the 2002 Social Security Survey (EPS), to project the future benefits of the generations that are now contributing to the system.6 The use of individual data is relevant because it takes into account the large heterogeneity of individual experiences. We use these data to simulate the distribution of old-age benefits, which is a key aspect of a defined-contributions environment. A defined-contributions system has no solvency problems, as there are few, if any, guarantees involved. Beyond the rate of return on investments, however, the final pension depends heavily on the amount, number, and timing of contributions. In a defined-benefits system, shocks affect the solvency of the system, whereas in a defined-contributions system, individuals bear much of the risk regarding the amount of the final pension.7 In fact, while the theoretical replacement rates are high for those who contribute throughout their working lives, they may be quite low for workers with infrequent contributions.8 The use of individual-level data allows us to identify some of the risks that generate such uncertainty in Chile's private pension system. When the Chilean system was designed, it was expected to deliver replacement rates of around 75 percent.9 This is the case for around one-third of affiliates. However, the strong heterogeneity of individual income and contribution density profiles means that some people will be in a very difficult situation [End Page 228] when they retire.10 Self-employed workers (who are not mandated to contribute in Chile) and women (who have a relatively low participation rate) appear to make up the most vulnerable categories. Additionally, a considerable segment of the population shifts between salaried work and self-employment and between formal and informal employment. Even if they work most of their active life, such workers may end up with low contribution densities. Con­sequently, the average contribution density in the case of the Chilean pension system hides very different realities that should be considered when evaluating the system's performance. The main results of this paper show that under current circumstances a considerable group of old-age retirees will receive pensions below the level of the minimum pension guaranteed by the state. At the same time, most of them will not be...",Francisco López del Pino; Francisco. Pino; Guillermo. Larra amp iacute n; Guillermo. Larra&amp;iacute;n; Solange Berstein; Solange.

Business dynamics of innovating firms: Linking U.S. patents with administrative data on workers and firms,"Abstract This paper discusses the construction of a new longitudinal database tracking inventors and patent‐owning firms over time. We match granted patents between 2000 and 2011 to administrative databases of firms and workers housed at the U.S. Census Bureau. We use inventor information in addition to the patent assignee firm name to improve on previous efforts linking patents to firms. The triangulated database allows us to maximize match rates and provide validation for a large fraction of matches. In this paper, we describe the construction of the database and explore basic features of the data. We find patenting firms, particularly young patenting firms, disproportionally contribute jobs to the U.S. economy. We find that patenting is a relatively rare event among small firms but that most patenting firms are nevertheless small, and that patenting is not as rare an event for the youngest firms compared to the oldest firms. Although manufacturing firms are more likely to patent than firms in other sectors, we find that most patenting firms are in the services and wholesale sectors.

Go West Young Firm: The Impact of Startup Migration on the Performance of Migrants,"This paper studies how regional migration to tech clusters impacts the performance of startups within the United States. Startups that move to Silicon Valley experience a significant improvement in performance. This improvement is higher than migrations to other regions in the United States, many of which report null treatment effects. The startups that benefit the most from migration are those leaving low performing entrepreneurial ecosystems and moving to high performing ecosystems, consistent with an agglomeration mechanism. Within different measures of the ecosystem, the level of local patenting predicts startup improvements more than venture capital or the quality-adjusted number of startups, suggesting the local innovation environment is more important to migrant performance than financing or the presence of other startup peers.

Passive Versus Active Growth: Evidence from Founder Choices and Venture Capital Investment,"This paper develops a novel approach for assessing the role of passive learning versus a proactive growth orientation in the entrepreneurial growth process.We develop a simple model linking early-stage founder choices, venture capital investment and skewed growth outcomes such as the achievement of an IPO or significant acquisition.Using comprehensive business registration data from 34 US states from 1995-2004, we observe that firms that register in Delaware or obtain intellectual property such as a patent or trademark are far more likely to ultimately realize significant equity growth, and these choices also predict early-stage venture capital investment.Moreover, the estimated probability of receiving venture capital as reflected in early-stage founder choices predicts growth even for firms that do not receive venture capital.We use these findings to estimate bounds on the fraction of proactive versus passive firms among firms that ultimately achieve significant equity growth.While nearly half of all firms that achieve modest equity growth (> $10M) are consistent with passive learning (as they neither make early-stage founder choices nor receive venture capital), 78% of firms experiencing an equity growth event greater than $100M are associated with active founder choices and/or venture capital investment, and these firms are concentrated in geographic hubs such as Silicon Valley.Finally, our approach offers a novel approach for estimating the private returns to venture capital, matching on founder choices rather than demographics; consistent with prior studies, venture-backed firms are approximately 5X more likely to grow, with heterogeneity across location and time period.",Christian Catalini; Jorge Guzman; Jorge Guzmán; Scott Stern,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w26073,"Venture capital, Investment (military), Economics, Initial public offering, Social venture capital, Finance, Business, Monetary economics, Political science, Politics, Law",National Bureau of Economic Research; Brandeis University,"MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main Street, E62-480 Cambridge, MA 02142; Brandeis University, Wharton School of Management, Michigan University, Kellogg School of Management, and Columbia Business School.; Columbia Business School Uris Hall, 711 116th St & Broadway New York, NY 10027; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main Street, E62-476 Cambridge, MA 02142","MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main Street, E62-480 Cambridge, MA 02142; Brandeis University, Wharton School of Management, Michigan University, Kellogg School of Management, and Columbia Business School.; Columbia Business School Uris Hall, 711 116th St & Broadway New York, NY 10027; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main Street, E62-476 Cambridge, MA 02142"
Business Dynamic Statistics of Innovative Firms,"A key driver of economic growth is the reallocation of resources from low to high productivity activities. Innovation plays an important role in this regard by introducing new products, services, and business methods that ultimately lead to increased productivity and rising living standards. Traditional measures of innovation, particularly those based on aggregate inputs, are increasingly unable to capture the breadth and depth of innovation in modern economies. In this paper, we describe an effort at the US Census Bureau, the Business Dynamics Statistics of Innovative Firms (BDS-IF) project, which aims to address these challenges by extending the Business Dynamics Statistics data to include new measures of innovative activity. The BDS-IF project will produce measures of firm, establishment, and employment flows by firm age, firm size, and industry for the subset of firms engaged in activities related to innovation. These activities include patenting and trademarking, the employment of STEM workers, and R&D expenditures. The exibility of the underlying data infrastructure allows this measurement agenda to be extended to include copyright activity, management practices, and high growth firms.",Elisabeth Perlman; Elisabeth Ruth Perlman; Nathan Goldschlag,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,,"Productivity, Business, Census, Industrial organization, Business cycle, Marketing, Economics, Economic growth, Population, Demography, Sociology, Keynesian economics",,,
What Is a Patent Worth? Evidence from the U.S. Patent “Lottery”,"ABSTRACT We provide evidence on the value of patents to startups by leveraging the quasi‐random assignment of applications to examiners with different propensities to grant patents. Using unique data on all first‐time applications filed at the U.S. Patent Office since 2001, we find that startups that win the patent “lottery” by drawing lenient examiners have, on average, 55% higher employment growth and 80% higher sales growth five years later. Patent winners also pursue more, and higher quality, follow‐on innovation. Winning a first patent boosts a startup’s subsequent growth and innovation by facilitating access to funding from venture capitalists, banks, and public investors.",ALEXANDER LJUNGQVIST; Alexander Ljungqvist; DEEPAK HEGDE; Deepak Hegde; JOAN FARRE‐MENSA; Joan Farre-Mensa,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.12867,"Lottery, Venture capital, Patent office, Value (mathematics), Business, Quality (philosophy), Marketing, Economics, Finance, Microeconomics, Political science, Law, Philosophy, Epistemology, Machine learning, Computer science",University of Illinois Chicago; United States Patent and Trademark Office,"Joan Farre-Mensa is with the University of Illinois at Chicago.

"Patents, innovation, and development","I survey some recent research on the role of patents in encouraging innovation and growth in developing economies, beginning with a brief history of international patent systems and facts about the current use of patents around the world. I discuss research on the implications of patents for international technology transfer and domestic innovation. This is followed by a review of recent work by myself and co-authors on regional patent systems, the impact of patents on firm performance, and the impact on pharmaceutical patenting and domestic innovation.

Comparing Public Housing and Housing Voucher Tenants with Bayesian Propensity Scores,"AbstractThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) currently has no administrative data to compare housing quality of public housing units with that of Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP) units. The American Housing Survey (AHS) provides the only data available to compare subjective housing and neighborhood quality assessments in HUD's largest rental assistance programs.Quality comparisons based on AHS data are problematic because the AHS overrepresents public housing and underrepresents the HCVP.HUD administrative data, however, are an excellent source of prior information for the expected proportion of households in public housing. In this study, I explore Bayesian methods using prior information on variables such as income and rents to estimate propensity scores for program participation. I then use the Bayesian propensity scores to improve the reliability of AHS-based quality comparisons. Results indicate that, after adjusting for program participation propensities, little difference exists in AHS household and neighborhood quality ratings between public housing and voucher households.(ProQuest: ... denotes formulae omitted.)IntroductionToday, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides rental assistance to about 1 million households in public housing (PH) projects and about 2.1 million households through the Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP). *·2 PH units are owned and operated by public housing agencies (PHAs). In sharp contrast, the HCVP provides subsidizes to low-income households to seek safe and sanitary privately owned rental units.Numerous arguments are made for providing rental assistance in privately owned buildings instead of providing PH. The primary motivation for increasing private-sector housing choices has been expanding social and economic opportunities for low-income households receiving rental assistance. Another argument is that private owners might have better incentives for operational efficiency, thus lowering program costs.An argument against private-sector choices is that private landlords may have more incentive to control costs by reducing housing quality. To ensure all HCVP units meet a minimum-quality threshold, HUD requires compliance with Housing Quality Standards regulations. PHAs must preinspect units before tenants occupy a unit and PHAs enter into assistance contracts. Annual reinspections are also required for all units. Samples of units must be selected for quality control inspections, and PHAs and landlords must ensure that housing- quality problems are promptly rectified.Measuring living conditions of assisted households is integral to evaluating the performance of HUD rental assistance programs. Currently, HUD has no administrative data to compare the housing quality of PH units with that of HCVP units.In addition to providing quality housing, HUD rental assistance programs are also intended to promote access to good neighborhoods. Geocoding of HUD administrative records allows for comparison of census measures of neighborhood quality such as median income, poverty rates, and minority concentration. Buron and Pantrabansh (2007), however, report that census measures do not correlate well with HCVP households' subjective opinions of their neighborhoods.The American Housing Survey (AHS) data are the only data available for comparing both subjective housing quality assessments and subjective neighborhood quality assessments in HUD's largest rental assistance programs. Quality comparisons based on AHS data are problematic because the AHS overrepresents PH and underrepresents the HCVP. The 2009 sum of weights was about 1.65 million households for either program. Apparently, many AHS HCVP tenants respond that they are PH tenants (Casey, 1992; HUD, 2008; Rucinski and Athey, 1995; Shroder, 2002).In 2011, the Census Bureau began using HUD administrative data to sample renters known to receive rental assistance through various HUD programs. …",Brent D.

Jobs for the Heartland: Place-Based Policies in 21st Century America,"The economic convergence of American regions has greatly slowed, and rates of long-term nonemployment have even been diverging.Simultaneously, the rate of non-employment for working age men has nearly tripled over the last 50 years, generating a terrible social problem that is disproportionately centered in the eastern parts of the American heartland.Should more permanent economic divisions across space lead American economists to rethink their traditional skepticism about place-based policies?We document that increases in labor demand appear to have greater impacts on employment in areas where not working has been historically high, suggesting that subsidizing employment in such places could particularly reduce the not working rate.Pro-employment policies, such as a ramped up Earned Income Tax Credit, that are targeted towards regions with more elastic employment responses, however financed, could plausibly reduce suffering and materially improve economic performance.",Benjamin Austin; Edward Glaeser; Lawrence H.

Information disclosure and the market for acquiring technology companies,"Abstract Research Summary The market for acquiring technology companies is rife with information frictions. Although such frictions can stifle trading activity, they also provide room for strategic gain. We investigate this dual role of information frictions by exploiting an institutional reform that releases technological information to the public domain. Leveraging cross‐sectoral variation in the magnitude of disclosure, we find an increase in acquisition activity and in the technological distance between matched pairings. In line with predictions from strategic factor market theory, however, we also find a disproportionate decline in acquirer returns on average. Our findings suggest that information disclosed through the reform‐facilitated exchange in the takeover market yet had a leveling effect on the returns to acquirers. Managerial Summary Firms acquire technology‐oriented companies to complement internal R&amp;D projects and accelerate the innovation process. But identifying promising targets is challenging, not least due to the lack of information about the value of acquired technologies. This study investigates an information shock and tests its effects on the market for acquiring technology‐intensive companies. We find that greater disclosure of technological information to the public domain intensifies trading activity and allows acquirers to better identify and assess targets outside their core technological domains. But it also reduces the returns to acquirers. In combination, our findings illuminate a dual role of information disclosure: placing more information into the public domain may facilitate trade in corporate takeover markets while simultaneously restricting acquirer opportunities for strategic gain.",Carlos J.

The Impact of Venture Capital Monitoring,"ABSTRACT We show that venture capitalists' (VCs) on‐site involvement with their portfolio companies leads to an increase in both innovation and the likelihood of a successful exit. We rule out selection effects by exploiting an exogenous source of variation in VC involvement: the introduction of new airline routes that reduce VCs' travel times to their existing portfolio companies. We confirm the importance of this channel by conducting a large‐scale survey of VCs, of whom almost 90% indicate that direct flights increase their interaction with their portfolio companies and management, and help them better understand companies' activities.",RICHARD R.

"Firm Age, Investment Opportunities, and Job Creation","ABSTRACT New firms are an important source of job creation, but the underlying economic mechanisms for why this is so are not well understood. Using an identification strategy that links shocks to local income to job creation in the nontradable sector, we ask whether job creation arises more through new firm creation or through the expansion of existing firms. We find that new firms account for the bulk of net employment creation in response to local investment opportunities. We also find significant gross job creation and destruction by existing firms, suggesting that positive local shocks accelerate churn.",DAVID ROBINSON; David T.

Rural–urban migration of Alaska Indigenous peoples: changing patterns and drivers,"Abstract Migration from rural areas to urban population centers has long been associated with modernization; a pattern one might expect to accelerate as advancing climate change degrades rural land-based livelihoods. Does rural–urban migration of arctic Indigenous peoples follow a similar pattern? Has depopulation of rural arctic areas accelerated as climate-driven environmental change has intensified in the rapidly warming arctic? What are the main drivers of mobility, both historically and more recently? We address these questions through a review and synthesis of empirical studies of rural–urban migration of arctic Indigenous peoples using individual records over the past four decades, along with analysis of new data informed by those previous studies. The use of microdata allows us to incorporate variation in individual situations and choices as well as community characteristics that vary across space and time, permitting us to make inferences about factors associated with decisions to move. The evidence shows that rural–urban migration patterns appear largely to have persisted over the decades, but some drivers have changed. Living costs appear to have replaced livelihood opportunities as the dominant driver since 2000. Other changes in decisions to move are complex, and require additional research to understand.",Matthew Berman; Ruoqing Wang-Cendejas,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00168-024-01298-7,"Indigenous, Livelihood, Geography, Arctic, Climate change, Urbanization, Microdata (statistics), Population, Modernization theory, Rural area, Socioeconomics, Economic growth, Environmental planning, Economic geography, Census, Political science, Agriculture, Ecology, Sociology, Economics, Demography, Archaeology, Law, Biology",Providence College; Office of Inspector General; University of Alaska Anchorage,"Institute of Social and Economic Research, University of Alaska Anchorage, 3211 Providence Drive, Anchorage, AK, 99508, USA; Office of the Inspector General, Department of Veterans Affairs, 351 E Temple St., Suite B510, Los Angeles, CA, 90012, USA","Institute of Social and Economic Research, University of Alaska Anchorage, 3211 Providence Drive, Anchorage, AK, 99508, USA; Office of the Inspector General, Department of Veterans Affairs, 351 E Temple St., Suite B510, Los Angeles, CA, 90012, USA"

"It Ain't Broke: The Past, Present, and Future of Venture Capital","This article presents a selective history of the U.S. venture capital (VC) industry, a discussion of the current state of the market, and some predictions about where the market is going. There is no doubt that the U.S. venture capital industry has been very successful. The VC model has provided an efficient solution to a difficult problem—that of enabling people with promising ideas but often limited track records to raise capital from outside investors. A large fraction of IPOs, including many of the most successful, have been funded by venture capitalists, and the U.S. VC model has been copied around the world. Armed with this historical perspective, the authors view with skepticism the recent claims that the VC model is broken. In the past, VC investments in companies have represented a remarkably constant 0.15% of the total value of the stock market; and commitments to VC funds, while more variable, have been consistently in the 0.10% to 0.20% range. Both of these percentages have continued to hold in recent years. And despite the relatively low number of IPOs, the returns to VC funds this decade have largely maintained their historical relationship to the overall stock market. To be sure, VC investment and returns continue to be subject to boom‐and‐bust cycles. But if the recent period has most of the features of a bust, the authors view today's historically low level of commitments to U.S. VC funds as a fairly reliable indicator of relatively high expected returns for the 2009 and (probably) 2010 vintage years. Perhaps the most promising future role for venture capital, as the authors suggest in closing, is to increase the productivity of the corporate research and development function through various kinds of partnerships and outsourcing arrangements.",Josh Lerner; Steven N.

The Consequences of Entrepreneurial Finance: A Regression Discontinuity Analysis,"This paper documents the role of angel funding for the growth, survival, and access to follow-on funding of high-growth start-up firms.We use a regression discontinuity approach to control for unobserved heterogeneity between firms that obtain funding and those that do not.This technique exploits that a small change in the collective interest levels of the angels can lead to a discrete change in the probability of funding for otherwise comparable ventures.We first show that angel funding is positively correlated with higher survival, additional fundraising outside the angel group, and faster growth measured through growth in web site traffic.The improvements typically range between 30% and 50%.When using the regression discontinuity approach, we still find a strong, positive effect of angel funding on the survival and growth of ventures, but not on access to additional financing.Overall, the results suggest that the bundle of inputs that angel investors provide have a large and significant impact on the success and survival of start-up ventures.",Antoinette Schoar; Josh Lerner; William Kerr; William R.

Buy Local? The Geography of Successful and Unsuccessful Venture Capital Expansion,"We document geographic concentration by both venture capital firms and venture capital-financed companies in three cities -San Francisco, Boston, and New York.We find that firms open new satellite offices based on the success rate of venture capital-backed investments in an area.Geography is also significantly related to outcomes.Venture capital firms based in locales that are venture capital centers outperform, regardless of the stage of the investment.Ironically, this outperformance arises from outsized performance outside of the venture capital firms' office locations, including in peripheral locations.If the goal of state and local policy makers is to encourage venture capital investment, outperformance of non-local investments suggests that policy makers might want to mitigate costs associated with established venture capitalists investing in their geographies rather than encouraging the establishment of new venture capital firms",Anna Kovner; Henry Chen; Josh Lerner; Paul A.

"Private Equity, Jobs, and Productivity","Private equity critics claim that leveraged buyouts bring huge job losses and few gains in operating performance. To evaluate these claims, we construct and analyze a new dataset that covers US buyouts from 1980 to 2005. We track 3,200 target firms and their 150,000 establishments before and after acquisition, comparing to controls defined by industry, size, age, and prior growth. Buyouts lead to modest net job losses but large increases in gross job creation and destruction. Buyouts also bring TFP gains at target firms, mainly through accelerated exit of less productive establishments and greater entry of highly productive ones.

Fire in the belly? Employee motives and innovative performance in start‐ups versus established firms,"Research Summary: We examine whether start‐ups attract employees with different pecuniary and non‐pecuniary motives than small or large established firms. We then explore whether such differences in employee motives may lead to differences in innovative performance across firm types. Using data on more than 10,000 U.S. R&amp;D employees, we find that start‐up employees (“joiners”) place lower importance on job security and salary but greater importance on independence and responsibility. Start‐up employees have higher patent output than employees in small and large established firms, and this difference is partly mediated by employee motives—especially joiners’ greater willingness to bear risk. We discuss implications for research as well as for managers and policy makers concerned with the supply of human capital to entrepreneurship and innovation. Managerial Summary: Start‐ups and established firms play different roles in the economy and differ with respect to their organizational features. Recent research has started to also explore differences in their human capital. While prior work focuses on employees’ skills and experience, we broaden the notion of human capital to include motivational characteristics. We find that start‐up employees differ from those working in established firms with respect to their motives, most notably a weaker concern with job security. Moreover, such differences can partly explain higher innovative performance in start‐ups. Our findings suggest that founders may derive significant benefits from hiring “joiners” with entrepreneurial motives. Our findings also have implications for corporate managers who seek to acquire start‐ups or who consider creating entrepreneurial units that replicate features of young and small organizations.",Henry Sauermann,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/sej.1267,"Business, Human capital, Job security, Salary, Entrepreneurship, Work (physics), Marketing, Economics, Finance, Market economy, Mechanical engineering, Engineering",National Bureau of Economic Research; European School of Management and Technology,"National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts; ESMT Berlin, Berlin, Germany","National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts; ESMT Berlin, Berlin, Germany"
Residential Segregation in Japan: Ethnic Stratification in a Global New Destination,"This study investigates the dynamics and factors affecting immigrant residential segregation in Japan between 2000 and 2020, a period marked by Japan's emergence as a global immigrant destination. Using restricted-access census microdata, I examined the segregation of the 12 largest immigrant groups to the Japanese majority and among each other. I then assessed the relationship between dissimilarity and factors affecting integration using pooled linear regressions and individual location attainment models. My findings reveal that all immigrant groups exhibit high residential segregation from the Japanese majority and notable pairwise segregation. There is a general trend of spatial assimilation that higher levels of socioeconomic factors predict less segregation, while Brazilians and Peruvians, the earliest contemporary immigrant group who arrived in Japan as ethnic descendants, demonstrate a pronounced tendency towards place stratification. These observations provide support for both spatial assimilation and place stratification theory in the Japanese context. Moreover, there is a strong trend of self-segregation among highly skilled elite, particularly Western immigrants from the Japanese majority and peer immigrants. The results provide support for this dichotomy in segregation trends, underlining the integration challenges for minority groups in global new destinations and the pronounced self-segregation among elite skilled minorities.",Hao Liang; Liang Hao,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/beh43,"Stratification (seeds), Ethnic group, Economic geography, Geography, Regional science, Political science, Seed dormancy, Botany, Germination, Dormancy, Law, Biology",Cornell University,Cornell University,Cornell University

"From Population Growth to Firm Demographics: Implications for Concentration, Entrepreneurship and the Labor Share","The US economy has undergone a number of puzzling changes in recent decades.Large firms now account for a greater share of economic activity, new firms are being created at a slower rate, and workers are getting paid a smaller share of GDP.This paper shows that changes in population growth provide a unified quantitative explanation for these long-term changes.The mechanism goes through firm entry rates.A decrease in population growth lowers firm entry rates, shifting the firm-age distribution towards older firms.Heterogeneity across firm age groups combined with an aging firm distribution replicates the observed trends.Micro data show that an aging firm distribution fully explains i) the concentration of employment in large firms, ii) and trends in average firm size and exit rates, key determinants of the firm entry rate.An aging firm distribution also explains the decline in labor's share of GDP.In our model, older firms have lower labor shares because of lower overhead labor to employment ratios.Consistent with our mechanism, we find that the ratio of nonproduction workers to total employment has declined in the US.",Hugo A.

Spatial Economics for Granular Settings,"We examine the application of quantitative spatial models to the growing body of fine spatial data used to study economic outcomes for regions, cities, and neighborhoods.In ""granular"" settings where people choose from a large set of potential residence-workplace pairs, idiosyncratic choices affect equilibrium outcomes.Using both Monte Carlo simulations and event studies of neighborhood employment booms, we demonstrate that calibration procedures that equate observed shares and modeled probabilities perform very poorly in such settings.We introduce a general-equilibrium model of a granular spatial economy.Applying this model to Amazon's proposed HQ2 in New York City reveals that the project's predicted consequences for most neighborhoods are small relative to the idiosyncratic component of individual decisions in this setting.We propose a convenient approximation for researchers to quantify the ""granular uncertainty"" accompanying their counterfactual predictions.",Felix Tintelnot; Jonathan Dingel; Jonathan I.

The Transmission of Commodity Price Super-Cycles,"We examine two key channels through which commodity price super-cycles affect the economy: a wealth channel, through which higher commodity prices increase domestic demand, and a cost channel, through which they induce wage increases.By exploiting regional variation in exposure to commodity price shocks and administrative firm-level data from Brazil, we empirically disentangle these transmission channels.We introduce a dynamic, two-region model with heterogeneous firms and workers to further quantify the mechanisms and evaluate welfare.A counterfactual economy in which commodity booms are purely endowment shocks experiences only 45% of the intersectoral labor reallocation between tradables and nontradables, and 40% of the within-tradables labor reallocation between domestic and exported production.Labor market frictions lead to persistent unemployment as the boom fades, and as a result the welfare gains obtained from a commodity super-cycle are 50% lower relative to those which would be obtained under a fully-flexible labor market.",Felipe Benguria; Felipe Saffie; Sergio Urzúa,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w24560,"Commodity, Transmission (telecommunications), Economics, Commerce, Computer science, Telecommunications, Market economy","University of Kentucky; Banco Central de Chile; Federal Reserve Board of Governors; Bank of Spain; University of Virginia; Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia; National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve Bank of New York; University of Maryland, College Park","Boston College, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Houston, University of Rochester, University of Virginia, Indiana University, University of Florida, University of Kentucky, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Drexel University and Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Conference on Credit Markets and the Macroeconomy, Federal Reserve Board,; Department of Economics University of Maryland 3115J Tydings Hall College Park, MD 20742 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Darden Business School University of Virginia; Department of Economics Gatton College of Business and Economics University of Kentucky 550 S Limestone Lexington, KY 40513; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, IMF, Bank of Spain, Central Bank of Chile","Boston College, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Houston, University of Rochester, University of Virginia, Indiana University, University of Florida, University of Kentucky, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Drexel University and Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Conference on Credit Markets and the Macroeconomy, Federal Reserve Board,; Department of Economics University of Maryland 3115J Tydings Hall College Park, MD 20742 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Darden Business School University of Virginia; Department of Economics Gatton College of Business and Economics University of Kentucky 550 S Limestone Lexington, KY 40513; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, IMF, Bank of Spain, Central Bank of Chile"
Opposing Firm Level Responses to the China Shock: Output Competition versus Input Supply,"We decompose the “China shock” into two components that induce different adjustments for firms exposed to Chinese exports: an output shock affecting firms selling goods that compete with similar imported Chinese goods, and an input supply shock affecting firms using inputs similar to the imported Chinese goods. Combining French accounting, customs, and patent information at the firm-level, we show that the output shock is detrimental to firms' sales, employment, and innovation. Moreover, this negative impact is concentrated on low-productivity firms. By contrast, we find a positive effect - although often not significant - of the input supply shock on firms' sales, employment and innovation",Antonin Bergeaud; Marc J.

Instrumental Variables and Causal Mechanisms: Unpacking The Effect of Trade on Workers and Voters,"Instrumental variables (IV) are a common means to identify treatment effects.But standard IV methods do not allow us to unpack the complex treatment effects that arise when a treatment and its outcome together cause a second outcome of interest.For example, IV methods have been used to show that import exposure to low-wage countries has adversely affected Western labor markets.Similarly, they have been used to show that import exposure has increased voter polarization.However, standard IV cannot estimate to what extent the latter is a consequence of the former.This paper proposes a new identification framework that allows us to do so, appealing to one additional identifying assumption without requiring additional instruments.The added identifying assumption can be relaxed, and bounds instead of point estimates can be derived.Applying this framework, we estimate that labor market adjustments explain most to all of the effect of import exposure on voting, thereby providing rigorous evidence that the correct policy response to voter polarization has to be focused on labor markets.",Christian Dippel; Robert Gold; Rodrigo Pinto; Stephan Heblich,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w23209,"Unpacking, Instrumental variable, Econometrics, Psychology, Economics, Social psychology, Business, Philosophy, Linguistics",Ministry of Economy; University of Warwick; Kiel Institute for the World Economy; University of Bristol; Anderson University - South Carolina; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Political Economy; UCLA Anderson School of Management 110 Westwood Plaza, C-521 Los Angeles, CA 90095 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Kiel Institute for the World Economy Kiellinie 66 24105 Kiel Germany; Department of Economics University of Bristol 8 Woodland Road Bristol BS8 1TN UK; participants at Bristol, Kiel, the LMU, the LSE, Toronto, UCLA,; Department of Economics 8283 Bunche Hall Los Angeles, CA 90095; UCSD, U HK, Warwick, the 2015 Quebec","Political Economy; UCLA Anderson School of Management 110 Westwood Plaza, C-521 Los Angeles, CA 90095 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Kiel Institute for the World Economy Kiellinie 66 24105 Kiel Germany; participants at Bristol, Kiel, the LMU, the LSE, Toronto, UCLA,; Department of Economics University of Bristol 8 Woodland Road Bristol BS8 1TN UK; Department of Economics 8283 Bunche Hall Los Angeles, CA 90095; UCSD, U HK, Warwick, the 2015 Quebec"
Firm heterogeneity and exports in the Netherlands: Identifying export potential beyond firm productivity,"According to the Melitz [2003. ‘The Impact of Trade on Intra-Industry Reallocations and Aggregate Industry Productivity.’ Econometrica 71: 1695–1725] model, potential exporters have to be sufficiently productive to overcome the entry costs of foreign markets. Once firms pass this productivity threshold, they all export. However, empirical evidence indicates that a substantial share of highly productive top-performing firms does not export. In this paper, we focus specifically on this group of high-performing non-exporters and identify the factors that prevent them from successfully exporting. We employ a large Dutch administrative dataset containing both small and large firms in services and manufacturing for the period 2010–2016. Our main findings are two-fold. First, controlling for high productivity identifies other factors that need to be fulfilled for exporting firms.

What Do Small Businesses Do?,"In this paper, we show that most small business owners are very different from the entrepreneurs that economic models and policy makers often have in mind.Using new data that samples early stage entrepreneurs just prior to business start up, we show that few small businesses intend to bring a new idea to market.Instead, most intend to provide an existing service to an existing market.Further, we find that most small businesses have little desire to grow big or to innovate in any observable way.We show that such behavior is consistent with the industry characteristics of the majority of small businesses, which are concentrated among skilled craftsmen, lawyers, real estate agents, doctors, small shopkeepers, and restaurateurs.Lastly, we show non pecuniary benefits (being one's own boss, having flexibility of hours, etc.) play a first-order role in the business formation decision.We then discuss how our findings suggest that the importance of entrepreneurial talent, entrepreneurial luck, and financial frictions in explaining the firm size distribution may be overstated.We conclude by discussing the potential policy implications of our findings.",Benjamin Pugsley; Benjamin Wild Pugsley; Erik Hurst,,,,,,,,,,,,2011.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w17041,"Luck, Small business, Flexibility (engineering), Real estate, Order (exchange), Business, Boss, Marketing, Service (business), Industrial organization, Economics, Finance, Management, Philosophy, Materials science, Theology, Metallurgy",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago; Pennsylvania State University,"Department of Economics University of Chicago Chicago, IL 60637; NBER Summer Institute Entrepreneurship Workshop, Penn State, Stanford University, and the University of Chicago; Booth School of Business University of Chicago Harper Center Chicago, IL 60637 and NBER; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Booth School of Business University of Chicago Harper Center Chicago, IL 60637 and NBER; NBER Summer Institute Entrepreneurship Workshop, Penn State, Stanford University, and the University of Chicago; Department of Economics University of Chicago Chicago, IL 60637"
"Firm Dynamics, Job Turnover, and Wage Distributions in an Open Economy","This paper explores the combined effects of reductions in trade frictions, tariffs, and firing costs on firm dynamics, job turnover, and wage distributions. It uses establishment-level data from Colombia to estimate an open economy dynamic model that links trade to job flows and wages. Counterfactual experiments imply that Colombia's integration with global product markets increased its national income at the expense of higher unemployment, greater wage inequality, and increased firm-level volatility. In contrast, contemporaneous labor market reforms dampened the increase in unemployment and aggregate job turnover. The results speak more generally to the effects of globalization on labor markets.

Income Growth and the Distributional Effects of Urban Spatial Sorting,"We explore the impact of rising incomes at the top of the distribution on spatial sorting patterns within large U.S. cities. We develop and quantify a spatial model of a city with heterogeneous agents and non-homothetic preferences for neighborhoods with endogenous amenity quality. As the rich get richer, demand increases for the high quality amenities available in downtown neighborhoods. Rising demand drives up house prices and spurs the development of higher quality neighborhoods downtown. This gentrification of downtowns makes poor incumbents worse off, as they are either displaced to the suburbs or pay higher rents for amenities that they do not value as much. We quantify the corresponding impact on well-being inequality. Through the lens of the quantified model, the change in the income distribution between 1990 and 2014 led to neighborhood change and spatial resorting within urban areas that increased the welfare of richer households relative to that of poorer households, above and beyond rising nominal income inequality.",Cecile Gaubert; Cécile Gaubert; Erik Hurst; Jessie Handbury; Victor Couture,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w26142,"Sorting, Geography, Economic geography, Economics, Mathematics, Algorithm","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Berkeley; University of Chicago; University of Pennsylvania","University of Pennsylvania The Wharton School; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business;  National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); University of California–Berkeley.; University of California–Berkeley Department of Economics","University of Pennsylvania The Wharton School; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business;  National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); University of California–Berkeley.; University of California–Berkeley Department of Economics"

"Inequality in 3‐D: Income, Consumption, and Wealth","We do not need to and should not have to choose amongst income, consumption, or wealth as the superior measure of well‐being. All three individually and jointly determine well‐being. We are the first to study inequality in three conjoint dimensions for the same households, using income, consumption, and wealth from the 1989–2016 Surveys of Consumer Finances (SCF). The paper focuses on two questions. What does inequality in two and three dimensions look like? Has inequality in multiple dimensions increased by less, by more, or by about the same as inequality in any one dimension? We find an increase in inequality in two dimensions and in three dimensions, with a faster increase in multi‐dimensional inequality than in one‐dimensional inequality. Viewing inequality through one dimension greatly understates the level and the growth in inequality in two and three dimensions.

Is the Consumer Expenditure Survey Representative by Income?,"Aggregate under-reporting of household spending in the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) can result from two fundamental types of measurement errors: higher-income households (who presumably spend more than average) are under-represented in the CE estimation sample, or there is systematic under-reporting of spending by at least some CE survey respondents. Using a new data set linking CE units to zip-code level average Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), we show that the very highest-income households are less likely to respond to the survey when they are sampled, but unit non-response rates are not associated with income over most of the income distribution. Although increasing representation at the high end of the income distribution could in principle significantly raise aggregate CE spending, the low reported average propensity to spend for higher-income respondent households could account for at least as much of the aggregate shortfall in total spending.",David Johnson; David Swanson; John Edward Sabelhaus; John Greenlees; John Sabelhaus; John Shearer Greenlees; Stephen Ash; Stephen V.

Recent Trends in U.S. Top Income Shares in Tax Record Data Using More Comprehensive Measures of Income Including Accrued Capital Gains,"Access to IRS personal income tax records improves researchers' ability to track U.S. income and inequality, especially at the very top of the distribution (Piketty and Saez 2003).However, rather than following standard Haig-Simons income definitions, tax form income measures were designed to implement the Internal Revenue Code.Using IRS tax record data since 1989 statistically matched to Survey of Consumer Finances and Census data for income sources not available in tax data, we explore the robustness of levels and trends in inequality using the top income literature's tax return market income definition (Saez 2016) compared to more comprehensive income measures.We find that focusing solely on market income misses the important redistributive effects of government taxes and transfers.In addition, we find that the use of taxable realized capital gains changes the level and trend in top incomes relative to an accrued capital gains measure that is more consistent with Haig-Simons income definitions.",Gerald Auten; Jeff Larrimore; Philip Armour; Richard Burkhauser; Richard V.

Misperceptions About the Magnitude and Timing of Changes in American Income Inequality,"The rise in American inequality has been exaggerated both in magnitude and timing.Commentators lament the large gap between the growth rates of real median household income and of private sector productivity.This paper shows that a conceptually consistent measure of this growth gap over 1979 to 2007 is only one-tenth of the conventional measure.Further, the timing of the rise of inequality is often misunderstood.By some measures inequality stopped growing after 2000 and by others inequality has not grown since 1993.This cessation of inequality's secular rise in 2000 is evident from the growth of Census mean vs. median income, and in the income share of the top one percent of the income distribution.The income share of the 91st to 95th percentile has not increased since 1983, and the income ratio of the 90th to 10th percentile has barely increased since 1986.Further, despite a transient decline in labor's income share in 2000-06, by mid-2009 labor's share had returned virtually to the same value as in 1983, 1991, and 2001.Recent contributions in the inequality literature have raised questions about previous research on skill-biased technical change and the managerial power of CEOs.Directly supporting our theme of prior exaggeration of the rise of inequality is new research showing that price indexes for the poor rise more slowly than for the rich, causing most empirical measures of inequality to overstate the growth of real income of the rich vs. the poor.Further, as much as two-thirds of the post-1980 increase in the college wage premium disappears when allowance is made for the faster rise in the cost of living in cities where the college educated congregate and for the lower quality of housing in those cities.A continuing tendency for life expectancy to increase faster among the rich than among the poor reflects the joint impact of education on both economic and health outcomes, some of which are driven by the behavioral choices of the less educated.",Robert Gordon; Robert J.

Distributional National Accounts: Methods and Estimates for the United States*,"This article combines tax, survey, and national accounts data to estimate the distribution of national income in the United States since 1913. Our distributional national accounts capture 100% of national income, allowing us to compute growth rates for each quantile of the income distribution consistent with macroeconomic growth. We estimate the distribution of both pretax and posttax income, making it possible to provide a comprehensive view of how government redistribution affects inequality. Average pretax real national income per adult has increased 60% from 1980 to 2014, but we find that it has stagnated for the bottom 50% of the distribution at about $16,000 a year. The pretax income of the middle class—adults between the median and the 90th percentile—has grown 40% since 1980, faster than what tax and survey data suggest, due in particular to the rise of tax-exempt fringe benefits. Income has boomed at the top. The upsurge of top incomes was first a labor income phenomenon but has mostly been a capital income phenomenon since 2000. The government has offset only a small fraction of the increase in inequality. The reduction of the gender gap in earnings has mitigated the increase in inequality among adults, but the share of women falls steeply as one moves up the labor income distribution, and is only 11% in the top 0.1% in 2014.",Emmanuel Saez; Gabriel Zucman; Thomas Piketty,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjx043,"Economics, Earnings, Net national income, Income distribution, Gross income, Labour economics, Economic inequality, Distribution (mathematics), Percentile, National accounts, Measures of national income and output, Inequality, Unearned income, Demographic economics, Household income, Adjusted gross income, Income tax, Comprehensive income, State income tax, Macroeconomics, Public economics, Tax reform, Geography, Mathematical analysis, Statistics, Mathematics, Accounting, Archaeology","National Bureau of Economic Research; Paris School of Economics; University of California, Berkeley","Paris School of Economics; University of California, Berkeley, and National Bureau of Economic Research","Paris School of Economics; University of California, Berkeley, and National Bureau of Economic Research"
Consumption and Income Inequality in the U.S. Since the 1960s,"Official income inequality statistics indicate a sharp rise in inequality over the past five decades.These statistics do not accurately reflect inequality because income is poorly measured, particularly in the tails of the distribution, and current income differs from permanent income, failing to capture the consumption paid for through borrowing and dissaving and the consumption of durables such as houses and cars.Such limitations suggest that consumption inequality would more accurately reflect inequality in economic well-being.Highly cited recent work concludes that the rise in consumption inequality mirrors, or even exceeds, the rise in income inequality.We revisit this finding, constructing improved measures of consumption, focusing on its wellmeasured components that are reported at a high and stable rate relative to national accounts.While overall income inequality (as measured by the 90/10 ratio) rose over the past five decades, the rise in overall consumption inequality was small.The patterns for the two measures differ by decade, and they moved in opposite directions after 2006.Income inequality rose in both the top and bottom halves of the distribution, but increases in consumption inequality are only evident in the top half.We show that our results are robust to several different approaches, including one that accounts for measurement error using a demand system.Previous work that concluded that consumption inequality rises at least as much as income inequality is sensitive to how consumption is measured; excluding small, poorly measured components of consumption yields results very similar to ours.The declining quality of income data is likely an important reason for the differences between income and consumption at the very bottom.Asset price changes likely account for some of the differences between the measures in recent years for the top half of the distribution.",Bruce Meyer; James P.

"Corruption, Income Inequality, and Poverty in the United States","In this study we analyze the effects of corruption on income inequality and poverty. Our analysis advances the existing literature in four ways. First, instead of using corruption indices assembled by various investment risk services, we use an objective measure of corruption: the number of public officials convicted in a state for crimes related to corruption. Second, we use all commonly used inequality and poverty measures including various Atkinson indexes, Gini index, standard deviation of the logarithms, relative mean deviation, coefficient of variation, and the poverty rate defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. Third, we minimize the problems which are likely to arise due to data incomparability by examining the differences in income inequality, and poverty across U.S. states. Finally, we exploit both time series and cross sectional variation in the data. We find robust evidence that an increase in corruption increases income inequality and poverty.",Burak Gunalp; Burak Günalp; Oguzhan C.

Income Growth and its Distribution from Eisenhower to Obama: The Growing Importance of In-Kind Transfers (1959-2016),"Using Census Bureau estimates of the market value of in-kind transfers and Current Population Survey (ASEC-CPS) data over the period 1979 to 2007 , Burkhauser et al.

Income and Earnings Mobility in U.S. Tax Data,"We use a large panel of federal income tax data to investigate intragenerational income mobility in the United States. We have two primary objectives. First, we explore the determinants of two-year changes in individual labor earnings and family incomes, such as job or industry changes, marriage, divorce, and geographic mobility. Second, we evaluate how federal income taxes stabilize or destabilize post-tax income changes relative to pre-tax changes. We find a relatively high degree of income mobility, with almost half of workers exhibiting earnings increases or decreases of at least 25 percent, and two-fifths of tax units experiencing income changes of this magnitude. Male and female labor income mobility patterns are remarkably similar, though marriage is associated with earnings gains among men, but is associated with modest earnings declines among women. We also observe that large income gains are most likely among families that add workers -- either through marriage or through a second family member entering the workforce.",David Splinter; Jacob Mortenson; Jeff Larrimore,,,,,,,,,,,,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2650379,"Earnings, Economics, Income tax, Labour economics, Demographic economics, Public economics, Finance",Federal Reserve Board of Governors; Federal Reserve; United States Congress,"Joint Committee on Taxation; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; Joint Committee on Taxation, US Congress","Joint Committee on Taxation; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; Joint Committee on Taxation, US Congress"

What has Been Happening to UK Income Inequality Since the Mid-1990s? Answers from Reconciled and Combined Household Survey and Tax Return Data,"Estimates of UK income inequality trends differ substantially according to whether estimates are based on household survey data (used for official statistics) or tax return data (used in the top incomes literature).We reconcile differences in variable definitions and combine survey and tax return data in order to take advantage of the much better coverage of top incomes in the latter, and provide improved estimates of UK inequality trends since the mid-1990s.We show there was a marked increase in income inequality in the early 2000s that survey-based estimates do not reveal, and our conclusions are robust to changes in the definitions of income, income-sharing unit, and summary inequality measure.In addition, our reconciled and combined data provide more comparable estimates of UK-US inequality trends than the top incomes literature to date.",Nicolas Hérault; Richard Burkhauser; Richard V.

Effects of Terms of Trade Gains and Tariff Changes on the Measurement of US Productivity Growth,"The acceleration in US productivity growth since 1995 is often attributed to declining prices for information technology (IT) goods, and therefore enhanced productivity growth in that sector. We investigate an alternative explanation for these IT price movements: gains in the US terms of trade and tariff reductions, especially for IT products, which led to greater gains than shown by official indexes. We do not, however, investigate the indexes used to deflate the domestic absorption components of GDP, and if upward biases are present in those indexes that could offset some of the effects of mismeasured export and import indexes.

Sourcing Substitution and Related Price Index Biases,"We define a class of bias problems that arise when purchasers shift their expenditures among sellers charging different prices for units of precisely defined and interchangeable product items that are nevertheless regarded as different for the purposes of price measurement. For businessto-business transactions, these shifts can cause sourcing substitution bias in the Producer Price Index (PPI) and the Import Price Index (MPI), as well as potentially in the proposed new true Input Price Index (IPI). Similarly, when consumers shift their expenditures for the same products temporally to take advantage of promotional sales or among retailers charging different per unit prices, this can cause a promotions bias problem in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or a CPI outlet substitution bias. We recommend alternatives to conventional price indexes that make use of unit values over precisely defined and interchangeable product items. We argue that our proposed ideal target indexes could greatly reduce these biases and make use of increasingly available electronic scanner data on prices and quantities. We also address the challenges national statistics agencies must surmount to produce price index measures more like the specified target ones.",Alice Nakamura; Alice O.

The Micro Origins of International Business-Cycle Comovement,"This paper investigates the role of individual firms in international business-cycle comovement using data covering the universe of French firm-level value added and international linkages over the period 1993–2007. At the micro level, trade and multinational linkages with a particular foreign country are associated with a significantly higher correlation between a firm and that foreign country. The impact of direct linkages on comovement at the micro level has significant macro implications. Without those linkages the correlation between France and foreign countries would fall by about 0.098, or one-third of the observed average correlation of 0.291 in our sample of partner countries.

The Agglomeration of US Ethnic Inventors,"The ethnic composition of US inventors is undergoing a significant transformation, with deep impacts for the overall agglomeration of US innovation.This study applies an ethnic-name database to individual US patent records to explore these trends with greater detail.The contributions of Chinese and Indian scientists and engineers to US technology formation increase dramatically in the 1990s.At the same time, these ethnic inventors became more spatially concentrated across US cities.The combination of these two factors helps stop and reverse long-term declines in overall inventor agglomeration evident in the 1970s and 1980s.The heightened ethnic agglomeration is particularly evident in industry patents for high-tech sectors, and similar trends are not found in institutions constrained from agglomerating (e.g., universities, government).",William Kerr; William R.

The Agglomeration of U.S. Ethnic Inventors,"Abstract Econometric studies quantifying the role of ethnic scientists and engineers for technology formation and diffusion are often hampered by data constraints. It is very difficult to assemble sufficient cross-sectional and longitudinal variation for large-scale panel exercises. This chapter describes a new approach for quantifying the ethnic composition of U.S. inventors. The study of how U.S. ethnic inventors agglomerate is very important, given the disproportionate contributions of immigrant researchers and their nonrandom spatial distribution across the United States. Such a characterization is necessary for understanding the geography of U.S. innovation and economic growth. Moreover, the spatial variation of immigrant researchers across cities allows for stronger quantitative assessments of the role of innovation in city growth. The chapter also discusses the growing contribution of ethnic inventors to U.S. technology formation and uses the patenting data to calculate concentration indices for U.S. innovation. It is hoped that the empirical platform developed in this study provides a foothold for furthering such analyses.",William R.

Who Benefits from State Corporate Tax Cuts? A Local Labor Markets Approach with Heterogeneous Firms,"This paper estimates the incidence of state corporate taxes on the welfare of workers, landowners, and firm owners using variation in state corporate tax rates and apportionment rules. We develop a spatial equilibrium model with imperfectly mobile firms and workers. Firm owners may earn profits and be inframarginal in their location choices due to differences in location-specific productivities. We use the reduced-form effects of tax changes to identify and estimate incidence as well as the structural parameters governing these impacts. In contrast to standard open economy models, firm owners bear roughly 40 percent of the incidence, while workers and landowners bear 30–35 percent and 25–30 percent, respectively.

How Social Security Reform Affects Retirement and Pension Claiming,"A reform increasing the full retirement age (FRA) by one year leads to larger than expected delays in pension claiming and retirement, while making late claiming more lucrative leads to a smaller than expected delay in pension claiming. Survey evidence shows people view the FRA as the “normal” retirement age and prefer to couple pension claiming and retirement decisions together, even though these two decisions are not coupled through social security provisions. Two mechanisms are at work: reference dependence with loss aversion in pension claiming, and spillovers from pension claiming on retirement choices.

Using Panel Tax Data to Examine the Transition to Retirement,"Using panel data from the Internal Revenue Service’s Statistics of Income (SOI) Division, we find that most individuals do not experience a reduction in inflation-adjusted spendable income after claiming Social Security. We also examine the composition of income after claiming and find that both Social Security benefits and non-Social Security retirement distributions typically represent substantial shares of income. Examining the five-year period from one year before individuals first receive Social Security retirement benefits to three years after, 81 percent of individuals had income, either directly or through a spouse, from employer retirement plans, annuities, or IRAs; and another 8 percent had a Form 1099-R (indicating a retirement account transaction, such as a rollover, that did not generate income), a Form 5498 (indicating IRA ownership), or both. This study uses the SOI 1999 Edited Panel of individual income tax returns, with information through tax year 2010, supplemented with data from information returns. We structure the data to follow individual taxpayers—specifically, individuals who were the primary or secondary taxpayer on a joint return or the primary taxpayer on a non-joint return in 1999—rather than tax returns. Information returns and various schedules filed with Form 1040 allow us to allocate labor income, Social Security benefits, and retirement income (pension, annuity, and IRA distributions) to primary and secondary filers on joint returns. Information returns also allow us to measure the income of all 1999 taxpayers through 2010 regardless of whether they filed a tax return in a subsequent year or not. We focus on working individuals age 55 to 61 in 1999 who did not receive Social Security benefits in 1999. Comparison with U.S. population counts suggests that nearly all individuals in this category filed a tax return in 1999.",Jessica Holland; Kevin Pierce; Peter J.

Is the U.S. Retirement System Contributing to Rising Wealth Inequality?,"Data from the Survey of Consumer Finances for 1989 through 2013 reveal five broad findings. First, overall retirement plan participation was stable or rising through 2007, though overall participation fell noticeably in the wake of the Great Recession and has remained lower. Second, cohort-based analysis of life-cycle trajectories shows that participation in retirement plans is strongly correlated with income, and that the recent decline in participation is concentrated among younger and low-to middle-income families. Third, the shift in the type of pension coverage from defined benefit (DB) to defined contribution (DC) occurred within—not just across—income groups. Fourth, retirement wealth is less concentrated than nonretirement wealth, so the growth of retirement wealth relative to nonretirement wealth helped offset the increasing concentration in nonretirement wealth. Fifth, the shift from DB to DC had only a modest effect in the other direction because DC wealth is more concentrated than DB wealth.",Alice Henriques; Alice M.

Adaptation and the Boundary of Multinational Firms,"This paper offers the first empirical analysis of the impact of adaptation on the boundary of multinational firms. To do so, we develop a ranking of sectors in terms of ""routineness"" by merging two sets of data: ratings of occupations by their intensities in solving problems from the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Information Network and U.S. employment shares of occupations by sectors from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment Statistics.

What Do We Really Know about Offshoring? Industries and Countries in Global Production Sharing,"Theories of offshoring model how firms divide production stages across borders. Empirical work on the phenomenon has long been hampered by a paucity of cross-country data on specialization within industries. In standard trade sources, we observe flows of goods between countries at the product level, but not the specific tasks that countries perform in manufacturing these products. The literature has consequently developed an inventive arsenal of indirect measures of industry fragmentation. In this paper, I turn to data on trade in assembly services ― a labor-intensive task that typically occurs at the end of the production chain ― to document which industries and countries are engaged in this common form of global production sharing. Trade in assembly services is prominent in just a handful of sectors, including apparel, electronics, footwear, furniture, toys, and transportation equipment. Data for the United States ― prior to the post-1980 growth in trade with developing countries ― reveal that most offshoring industries are relatively intensive in the employment of very low-wage labor, exhibit relatively wide variation in the wages paid to their employees, and use capital relatively unintensively. These industries tend to be less likely to hire workers in occupations that are intensive in routine tasks. Offshoring thus appears to be most prominent in sectors for which firms have a strong incentive to divide production between high-wage and low-wage countries and in which the automation of routinized jobs offer few opportunities to reduce labor intensity. Countries that specialize in manufacturing tend to cycle through offshoring industries as they accumulate capital, starting out in apparel, footwear, and toys and later moving into electronics and electrical machinery. These industry dynamics are most pronounced in labor-abundant East Asia. They are not present in the resource-abundant countries that specialize in primary commodities.",Gordon H.

Organizing the Global Value Chain,"We develop a property-rights model of the firm in which production entails a continuum of uniquely sequenced stages. In each stage, a final-good producer contracts with a distinct supplier for the procurement of a customized stage-specific component. Our model yields a sharp characterization for the optimal allocation of ownership rights along the value chain. We show that the incentive to integrate suppliers varies systematically with the relative position (upstream versus downstream) at which the supplier enters the production line. Furthermore, the nature of the relationship between integration and downstreamness depends crucially on the elasticity of demand faced by the final-good producer. Our model readily accommodates various sources of asymmetry across final-good producers and across suppliers within a production line, and we show how it can be taken to the data with international trade statistics. Combining data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Related Party Trade database and estimates of U.S. import demand elasticities from Broda and Weinstein (2006), we find empirical evidence broadly supportive of our key predictions. In the process, we develop two novel measures of the average position of an industry in the value chain, which we construct using U.S. Input-Output Tables.",Davin Chor; Pol Antras; Pol Antràs,,,,,,,,,,,,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.3982/ecta10813,"Value (mathematics), Chain (unit), Global value chain, Economics, Mathematics, Statistics, International trade, Physics, Astronomy, Comparative advantage",National Bureau of Economic Research; Dartmouth College; Harvard University,Dartmouth College - Tuck School of Business; Harvard University - Department of Economics;  National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER),Dartmouth College - Tuck School of Business; Harvard University - Department of Economics;  National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)
Intermediaries in International Trade: Direct versus indirect modes of export,"This paper examines the factors that give rise to intermediaries in exporting and explores the implications for trade volumes.Export intermediaries such as wholesalers serve different markets and export different products than manufacturing exporters.In particular, high market-specific fixed costs of exporting, the (lack of) quality of the general contracting environment and product-specific factors play important roles in explaining the existence of export intermediaries.These underlying differences between direct and intermediary exporters have important consequences for trade flows.The ability of export intermediaries to overcome country and product fixed costs means that they can more easily respond along the extensive margin to external shocks.Intermediaries and direct exporters respond differently to exchange rate fluctuations both in terms of the total value of shipments and the number of products exported as well as in terms of prices and quantities.Aggregate exports to destinations with high shares of indirect exports are much less responsive to changes in the real exchange rate than are exports to countries served primarily by direct exporters.",Andrew B.

The Economic Impacts of the US–China Trade War,"In 2018, the United States launched a trade war with China, marking an abrupt departure from its historical leadership in integrating global markets. By late 2019, the United States had imposed tariffs on roughly $350 billion of Chinese imports, and China had retaliated on $100 billion of US exports. Economists have used a diversity of data and methods to assess the impacts of the trade war on the United States, China, and other countries.

The Production Relocation and Price Effects of US Trade Policy: The Case of Washing Machines,"We estimate the price effect of US import restrictions on washers. The 2012 and 2016 antidumping duties against South Korea and China were accompanied by downward or minor price movements along with production relocation to other export platform countries. With the 2018 tariffs, on nearly all source countries, the price of washers increased nearly 12 percent. Interestingly, the price of dryers—not subject to tariffs—increased by an equivalent amount. Factoring in dryer prices and price increases by domestic brands, the 2018 tariffs on washers imply a tariff elasticity of consumer prices of above one.

The Production Relocation and Price Effects of U.S. Trade Policy: The Case of Washing Machines,"We analyze several rounds of U.S. import restrictions against washing machines.Using retail price data, we estimate the price effect of these import restrictions by comparing the price changes of washers with those of other appliances.We find that in response to the 2018 tariffs on nearly all source countries, the price of washers rose by nearly 12 percent; the price of dryersa complementary good not subject to tariffs-increased by an equivalent amount.Factoring in the effect of dryers and price increases by domestic brands, our estimates for the 2018 tariffs on washers imply a tariff elasticity of consumer prices of between 110 and 230 percent.The 2016 antidumping duties against China-which accounted for the overwhelming majority of U.S. imports-led to minor price movements due to subsequent production relocation to other export platform countries.Perhaps surprisingly, the 2012 antidumping duties against Korea led to relocation of production to China, actually resulting in lower washer prices in the United States.We find that our measure of the tariff elasticity of consumer prices may differ in sign and magnitude from conventional pass-through estimates which are based on a regression of country-specific import price changes on country-specific tariff changes.Production relocation effects, price changes by domestic brands, and price changes of complementary goods all contribute to the differences between these measures.",Aaron Flaaen; Ali Hortaçsu; Alı Hortaçsu; Felix Tintelnot,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w25767,"Relocation, Production (economics), Business, Economics, Industrial organization, International economics, Commerce, Microeconomics, Computer science, Operating system",University of Chicago; South University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve Board of Governors,"Department of Economics University of Chicago 5757 South University Avenue Chicago, IL 60637 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Federal Reserve Board of Governors 20th and C St. Washington DC. 20551; NBER Working Paper; Department of Economics University of Chicago 1126 East 59th Street Chicago, IL 60637 and","Department of Economics University of Chicago 5757 South University Avenue Chicago, IL 60637 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Federal Reserve Board of Governors 20th and C St. Washington DC. 20551; NBER Working Paper; Department of Economics University of Chicago 1126 East 59th Street Chicago, IL 60637 and"

The paper classifies firms into four ordinal categories: Not Credit Constrained, Maybe Credit Constrained, Partially Credit Constrained, and Fully Credit Constrained to understand the characteristics of the firms that fall into each group. Comparable data from the Enterprise Surveys for 116 countries are used to look at the relationship between firm size and credit-constrained status. First, the analysis finds that small and medium enterprises are more likely to be credit constrained (either partially or fully) than large firms. Furthermore, small and medium enterprises finance their working capital and investments mainly through trade credit and informal sources of finance. These two results hold to a large extent in all the regions of the developing world. Second, although size is a significant predictor of the probability of being credit constrained, firm age is not. Third, high-performing firms, as measured by labor productivity, are less likely to be credit constrained. This result applies to all firms but is not as strong for small firms as it is for large and medium firms. Finally, in countries with high private credit-to-gross domestic product ratios, firms are less likely to be credit constrained. Given the importance of access to credit for firm growth and efficiency, this paper confirms that throughout the developing world access to credit is inversely related to firm size but positively related to productivity and financial deepening in the country.

The intergenerational transmission of inequality: Maternal disadvantage and health at birth,"Health at birth is an important predictor of long-term outcomes, including education, income, and disability. Recent evidence suggests that maternal disadvantage leads to worse health at birth through poor health behaviors; exposure to harmful environmental factors; worse access to medical care, including family planning; and worse underlying maternal health. With increasing inequality, those at the bottom of the distribution now face relatively worse economic conditions, but newborn health among the most disadvantaged has actually improved. The most likely explanation is increasing knowledge about determinants of infant health and how to protect it along with public policies that put this knowledge into practice.",Anna Aizer; Janet Currie,,,,,,,,,,,,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1251872,"Disadvantage, Disadvantaged, Inequality, Health equity, Public health, Health care, Maternal health, Environmental health, Medicine, Demographic economics, Economic growth, Economics, Health services, Political science, Population, Nursing, Mathematical analysis, Mathematics, Law",National Bureau of Economic Research; Princeton University; Brown University,"National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.; Department of Economics, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA.; Department of Economics, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912, USA.","National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.; Department of Economics, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA.; Department of Economics, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912, USA."
The Long-Run Impact of Cash Transfers to Poor Families,"We estimate the long-run impact of cash transfers to poor families on children's longevity, educational attainment, nutritional status, and income in adulthood. To do so, we collected individual-level administrative records of applicants to the Mothers' Pension program—the first government-sponsored welfare program in the United States (1911–1935)—and matched them to census, WWII, and death records. Male children of accepted applicants lived one year longer than those of rejected mothers. They also obtained one-third more years of schooling, were less likely to be underweight, and had higher income in adulthood than children of rejected mothers.

"Undue Burden Beyond Texas: An Analysis of Abortion Clinic Closures, Births, and Abortions in Wisconsin","Abstract In this paper, we estimate the impacts of abortion clinic closures on access to clinics in terms of distance and congestion, abortion rates, and birth rates. Between 2010 and 2017, Wisconsin passed three laws regulating abortion providers and two of five abortion clinics closed in Wisconsin, increasing the distance to the nearest clinic to 55 miles on average and to over 100 miles in the most affected counties. We use a difference‐in‐differences design to estimate the effect of changes in travel distance on births and abortions, using within‐county variation across time in distance to identify the effect. We find that a 100‐mile increase in distance to the nearest clinic is associated with 30.7 percent fewer abortions and 3.2 percent more births. We see no significant effect of increased congestion at remaining clinics on abortion rates. Interacting the legislative changes with distance, we find that the effects of distance on abortion are approximately 1.33 time stronger in the presence of laws requiring multiple physician visits to obtain an abortion. Our results suggest that even small numbers of clinic closures can result in significant restrictions to abortion access of similar magnitude to those seen in Texas where a greater number of clinics ceased operations.",Jason Fletcher; Jason M.

INTENDED AND UNINTENDED EFFECTS OF THE WAR ON POVERTY: WHAT RESEARCH TELLS US AND IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY,"During the mid-1960s, the United States adopted a series of cash and in-kind transfer programs, as well as human capital investment strategies, as part of the War on Poverty. A number of other programs were first proposed as part of this ""war"" but were not implemented until the mid-1970s. These programs had noble goals: to increase incomes at the bottom of the income distribution, reduce poverty, and improve nutrition, heath, and human capital. However, various features of the programs also had the potential to produce unintended consequences: for example, means-tested programs can discourage work. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate the main War on Poverty programs that were aimed at the low-income nonelderly population along with several follow-on programs. We focus on both intended and unintended consequences, drawing on the most compelling causal evidence. We conclude with a series of lessons learned and questions that are outstanding.",Lynn A.

Identifying Causal Effects of Reproductive Health Improvements on Women's Economic Empowerment Through the Population Poverty Research Initiative,"Policy Points: Improvements in reproductive health lead to improvements in women's economic empowerment. Contraceptive use improves women's agency, education, and labor force participation; higher maternal age at first birth (reducing adolescent childbearing) increases the likelihood of school completion and participation in the formal labor market; and having fewer children increases labor market participation. Reproductive health is not just a benefit to a woman's individual rights, but her gateway for breaking free from her poverty trap and improving the welfare of herself, her children, and her household. Context Women's access to employment, business opportunities, and financial resources is critical to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals over the next 15 years. With increased attention to women's economic empowerment among donors and policymakers across the globe, this moment is a pivotal one in which to review the current state of the research on this topic. Methods We reviewed the Population and Poverty (PopPov) Research Initiative results from the past 10 years with attention to the causal link between reproductive health improvements and women's economic empowerment, in addition to seminal research that informed our understanding of the link. Findings Our review of PopPov findings revealed that improvements in reproductive health do lead to improvements in women's economic empowerment; expanding contraceptive use improves women's agency, education, and labor force participation; higher maternal age at first birth (reducing adolescent childbearing) increases the likelihood of school completion and participation in the formal labor market; and having fewer children increases labor force participation. Conclusions Gaps remain in measuring women's work and in the full exploration of women's economic empowerment. More research is needed regarding the long‐term impact of reproductive health improvements on women's economic empowerment, as some studies have shown that at times unintended negative consequences occur after early positive improvements.",JOCELYN E.

"The Gender Wage Gap: Extent, Trends, and Explanations","Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) microdata over the 1980–2010 period, we provide new empirical evidence on the extent of and trends in the gender wage gap, which declined considerably during this time. By 2010, conventional human capital variables taken together explained little of the gender wage gap, while gender differences in occupation and industry continued to be important. Moreover, the gender pay gap declined much more slowly at the top of the wage distribution than at the middle or bottom and by 2010 was noticeably higher at the top. We then survey the literature to identify what has been learned about the explanations for the gap. We conclude that many of the traditional explanations continue to have salience. Although human-capital factors are now relatively unimportant in the aggregate, women's work force interruptions and shorter hours remain significant in high-skilled occupations, possibly due to compensating differentials. Gender differences in occupations and industries, as well as differences in gender roles and the gender division of labor remain important, and research based on experimental evidence strongly suggests that discrimination cannot be discounted. Psychological attributes or noncognitive skills comprise one of the newer explanations for gender differences in outcomes. Our effort to assess the quantitative evidence on the importance of these factors suggests that they account for a small to moderate portion of the gender pay gap, considerably smaller than, say, occupation and industry effects, though they appear to modestly contribute to these differences.

Children and the Remaining Gender Gaps in the Labor Market,"The past five decades have seen a remarkable convergence in the economic roles of men and women in society. Yet, persistently large gender gaps in terms of labor supply, earnings, and representation in top jobs remain. Moreover, in countries like the United States, convergence in labor market outcomes appears to have slowed in recent decades. In this article, we focus on the role of children and show that many potential explanations for the remaining gender disparities in labor market outcomes are related to the fact that children impose significantly larger penalties on the career trajectories of women relative to men. We document that, in the United States, more than two-thirds of the overall gender earnings gap can be accounted for by the differential impacts of children on women and men. We propose a simple model of household decision-making to motivate the link between children and gender gaps in the labor market, and to help rationalize how various factors potentially interact with parenthood to produce differential outcomes by gender.

The Economic Consequences of Being Denied an Abortion,"This paper evaluates the economic consequences of being denied an abortion due to gestational limits.We link credit report data to the Turnaway Study, the first study to collect high-quality, longitudinal data on women receiving or being denied a wanted abortion in the United States.We compare financial outcomes over a ten-year period for women who had pregnancies just above and below a gestational age limit allowing for a wanted abortion.Outcome trajectories are similar for the two groups of women prior to the abortion encounter.Following the encounter, women who were denied an abortion experience a large increase in financial distress that is sustained for several years.There is also some evidence of a short-term reduction in credit access, but no change in measures of borrowing.Our results highlight important financial and economic consequences of restrictions on abortion access.",Diana Greene Foster; Laura Wherry; Sarah Miller,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w26662,"Abortion, Psychology, Economics, Pregnancy, Biology, Genetics",Brookings Institution; New York University; University of Michigan–Ann Arbor; Ross School; RAND Corporation; National Bureau of Economic Research,"APPAM, ASHEcon, and ASSA annual meetings, Brookings Institution, Dartmouth University, George Washington University, Harvard University, Imperial College London, NBER Summer Institute, RAND Corporation, Stanford University, Simon Fraser University,; Ross School of Business University of Michigan 701 Tappan Street Ann Arbor, MI 48109 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Graduate School of Public Service New York University 295 Lafayette Street New York, NY 10012","APPAM, ASHEcon, and ASSA annual meetings, Brookings Institution, Dartmouth University, George Washington University, Harvard University, Imperial College London, NBER Summer Institute, RAND Corporation, Stanford University, Simon Fraser University,; Graduate School of Public Service New York University 295 Lafayette Street New York, NY 10012; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Ross School of Business University of Michigan 701 Tappan Street Ann Arbor, MI 48109 and"
"The Power of the Pill for the Next Generation: Oral Contraception's Effects on Fertility, Abortion, and Maternal and Child Characteristics","This paper considers how oral contraception's diffusion to young unmarried women affected the number and parental characteristics of children born to these women. In the short-term, pill access caused declines in fertility and increases in both the share of children born with low birthweight and the share born to poor households. In the long-term, access led to negligible changes in fertility while increasing the share of children with college-educated mothers and decreasing the share with divorced mothers. The short-term effects appear to be driven by upwardly-mobile women opting out of early childbearing while the long-term effects appear to be driven by a retiming of births to later ages. These effects differ from those of abortion legalization, although we find suggestive evidence that pill diffusion lowered abortions. Our results suggest that abortion and the pill are on average used for different purposes by different women, but on the margin some women substitute from abortion towards the pill when both are available.

"Specialization Then and Now: Marriage, Children, and the Gender Earnings Gap across Cohorts","In this paper, we examine the evolution of the gender gap associated with marriage and parental status, comparing cohorts born between 1936 and 1985. The model of household specialization and division of labor introduced by Becker posits that when forming households, couples will exploit the gains from trade by having one spouse specialize in market work while the other specializes in household work. Given the historical advantage of men in the labor market, the model predicts specialization by gender and therefore an earnings advantage for married men and an earnings disadvantage for married women. Is this model of specialization useful for understanding the evolution of the gender gap across generations of women. And what about children? Academic papers have shown that wages of mothers are significantly lower than those of non-mothers with similar human capital characteristics. We do not attempt to build a structural model here, but rather document how changing associations between marriage and earnings, and between children and earnings, have contributed to the gender gap in an “accounting” sense.",Chinhui Juhn; Kristin McCue,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.31.1.183,"Earnings, Economics, Human capital, Spouse, Disadvantage, Division of labour, Gender gap, Labour economics, Demographic economics, Work (physics), Sociology, Political science, Economic growth, Market economy, Mechanical engineering, Accounting, Engineering, Anthropology, Law",National Bureau of Economic Research; United States Census Bureau; University of Houston,"Kristin McCue is Principal Economist, U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC.; Chinhui Juhn is Henry Graham Professor of Economics, University of Houston, Houston, Texas, and Research Associate, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.","Kristin McCue is Principal Economist, U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC.; Chinhui Juhn is Henry Graham Professor of Economics, University of Houston, Houston, Texas, and Research Associate, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts."
Do Male-Female Wage Differentials Reflect Differences in the Return to Skill? Cross-City Evidence from 1980–2000,"Male-female wage gaps declined significantly over the 1980s and 1990s, while returns to education increased. In this paper, we use cross-city data to explore whether, like the return to education, the change in the gender wage gap may reflect changes in skill prices induced by the diffusion of information technology. We show that male-female and education-wage differentials moved in opposite directions in response to the adoption of PCs. Our most credible estimates imply that changes in skill prices driven by PC adoption can explain most of the decline in the US male-female wage gap since 1980.

"Good practices for the design, analysis, and interpretation of observational studies on birth spacing and perinatal health outcomes","Meta-analyses of observational studies have shown that women with a shorter interpregnancy interval (the time from delivery to start of a subsequent pregnancy) are more likely to experience adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm delivery or small for gestational age birth, than women who space their births further apart. However, the studies used to inform these estimates have methodological shortcomings.In this commentary, we summarise the discussions of an expert workgroup describing good practices for the design, analysis, and interpretation of observational studies of interpregnancy interval and adverse perinatal health outcomes.We argue that inferences drawn from research in this field will be improved by careful attention to elements such as: (a) refining the research question to clarify whether the goal is to estimate a causal effect vs describe patterns of association; (b) using directed acyclic graphs to represent potential causal networks and guide the analytic plan of studies seeking to estimate causal effects; (c) assessing how miscarriages and pregnancy terminations may have influenced interpregnancy interval classifications; (d) specifying how key factors such as previous pregnancy loss, pregnancy intention, and maternal socio-economic position will be considered; and (e) examining if the association between interpregnancy interval and perinatal outcome differs by factors such as maternal age.This commentary outlines the discussions of this recent expert workgroup, and describes several suggested principles for study design and analysis that could mitigate many potential sources of bias.",Alison M.

The entrepreneurial process: Evidence from a nationally representative survey,"Abstract Research Summary Scholars have traditionally characterized the variation in firm performance as determined by conditions after entry, where the entry decision is a one‐shot binary choice determined by cost–benefit analysis. However, recent theoretical work has posited that the entry decision is an outcome of a learning process and that the information acquired during the pre‐entry period shapes subsequent performance dynamics. We provide the first systematic data on the pre‐entry period using a nationally representative survey. We document the activities that prospective entrants undertake, finding variation according to opportunity costs, prior experience, and confidence levels. Our results suggest the pre‐entry period is shaped by a series of choices by prospective entrants as they contemplate entry, further exploration, or ending the entrepreneurial process. Managerial Summary We created and implemented a nationally representative survey on the entrepreneurial activities of Americans. Several interesting findings emerged. First, approximately a third of Americans report having had a business idea in the past 5 years, motivated in the vast majority of cases by lifestyle concerns rather than the pursuit of significant business opportunities. Fewer than half of those who considered starting a business take even the lowest cost steps, like searching the Internet for potential competitors or speaking with a friend. Our findings reveal an entrepreneurial process which involves a significant pre‐entry period where prospective entrepreneurs seek to acquire information about the quality of their idea, perform administrative tasks to prepare for launch and encounter frictions that impede their progress.",Aaron Chatterji; Aaron K.

Organization Theory and Methodology,"The foundations are being put in place for a revolution in the science of organizations. Some major analytical building blocks for the development of a theory of organizations are outlined and discussed in this paper. This development of organization theory will be hastened by increased understanding of the importance of the choice of definitions, tautologies, analytical techniques, and types of evidence. The two literatures of agency theory are briefly discussed in light of these issues. Because accounting is an integral part of the structure of every organization, the development of a theory of organizations will be closely associated with the development of a theory of accounting. This theory will explain why organizations take the form they do, why they behave as they do, and why accounting practices take the form they do. Because such positive theories as these are required for purposeful decision making, their development will provide a better scientific basis for the decisions of managers, standard-setting boards, and government regulatory bodies.",Michael C.

New Linked Employee-Employer Data Show Workforce Composition Is Associated With Health Insurance Offers Among Small Employers,"Decades of research shows that small firms are much less likely to offer health insurance than large firms, but less is known about differences among small employers. We examine this issue using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component with Administrative Records (MEPS-ICAR), a unique employer-employee linked data set that is constructed by matching the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) to Internal Revenue Service administrative records and the Decennial Census. Multivariate analyses show that among firms with fewer than 50 workers, the probability that workers receive an insurance offer is positively associated with higher median workforce incomes, and conditional offers of dependent coverage increase when the majority of workers are married or from a family with at least three members. This first application of the MEPS-ICAR highlights the significance of workforce characteristics in shaping small employer insurance benefits and the data’s usefulness for expanding analyses of policy changes, wage-benefit tradeoffs, and health insurance benefits.",Alice Zawacki; G.

Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance Premium Cost Growth and Its Association With Earnings Inequality Among US Families,"Importance Costs of employer-sponsored health care benefits have increased faster than workers’ wages for several decades, with important implications for disparities in earnings and wage stagnation. Objective To quantify how growth in employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) premiums may have been associated with reduced annual wages, disparities in earnings by race and ethnicity and wage level, and wage stagnation among US families with ESI. Design, Setting, and Participants In this economic evaluation, serial cross-sectional analyses were performed of US families receiving ESI from 1988 to 2019 based on data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, Kaiser Employer Health Benefits Survey, US Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey, and federal payroll taxation rates. Statistical analysis was conducted from February 2022 to July 2023. Main Outcomes and Measures Percentage of annual compensation associated with health care premiums (after accounting for tax deductibility) and lost wages associated with growth in cost of premiums from 1989 to 2019 based on 1988 compensation. To assess disparities, analyses were stratified by race and ethnicity and wage level. Results In 1988, 44.7 million individuals (head of household: mean [SD] age, 43.3 [13.1] years; 30.1% were female; and 2.4% identified as Asian, 6.2% as Hispanic, 8.6% as non-Hispanic Black, and 82.8% as non-Hispanic White) were covered by ESI family plans; this number remained similar in 2019 at 44.8 million individuals (head of household: mean [SD] age, 47.1 [12.9] years; 41.3% were female; and 1.3% identified as Asian, 9.9% as Hispanic, 9.9% as non-Hispanic Black, and 78.9% as non-Hispanic White). In 1988, the mean (SD) household size was 3.3 (1.3) people, and in 2019, it was 3.4 (1.3) people. If ESI costs had remained at the same proportion of the 1988 average compensation package, then in 2019, the median US family with ESI could have earned $8774 (95% CI, $8354-$9195) more in annual wages. During all 32 years, health care premiums as a percentage of compensation were greater for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic families than for non-Hispanic White families. By 2019, 13.8% (95% CI, 13.5%-14.1%) of compensation among non-Hispanic White families with ESI went to premium costs compared with 19.2% (95% CI, 18.8%-19.7%) among non-Hispanic Black families and 19.8% (19.3%-20.3%) among Hispanic families with ESI. In 2019, health care premiums as a percentage of compensation at the 95th percentile of earnings for families with ESI were 3.9% (95% CI, 3.8%-4.0%) compared with 28.5% (95% CI, 27.8%-29.2%) at the 20th percentile of earnings. From 1988 to 2019, the mean cumulative lost earnings associated with growth in health care premiums for the median US family with ESI was $125 340 (95% CI, $120 155-$130 525) in 2019 dollars, 4.7% of earnings over the 32-year period. Conclusions and Relevance This economic evaluation of US families receiving ESI suggests that 3 decades of increasing health care premiums were likely associated with reduced annual earnings and increased earnings inequality by race and ethnicity and wage level and were meaningfully associated with wage stagnation.",Dariush Mozaffarian; Ezekiel Emanuel; Kurt Hager,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.51644,"Earnings, Wage, Payroll, Demographic economics, Health care, Census, Population, Ethnic group, Demography, Health and Retirement Study, Economics, Medicine, Labour economics, Gerontology, Environmental health, Political science, Economic growth, Finance, Accounting, Sociology, Law",Tufts Medical Center; Tufts University; University of Pennsylvania; University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School,"Food Is Medicine Institute, Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts; Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, UMass Chan Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts; The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia; Division of Cardiology, Tufts Medical Center and Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts; Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia","Food Is Medicine Institute, Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts; Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, UMass Chan Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts; The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia; Division of Cardiology, Tufts Medical Center and Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts; Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"

Impact of Premium Subsidies on the Take-up of Health Insurance: Evidence from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA),"We study the coverage impacts of a 65 percent health insurance premium subsidy that targeted employer-insured workers who lost their jobs between September 2008 and May 2010. Our research represents the first econometric analysis of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) COBRA subsidy and contributes to a better understanding of consumer responses to government-subsidized private health insurance and discussions surrounding Affordable Care Act (ACA) policies. Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, we find that the subsidy is associated with a substantial increase in own-name employer coverage among the targeted group. We estimate a −0.38 to −0.27 price elasticity of demand for health insurance, depending on the specification. This suggests that consumers are somewhat more price sensitive than previously thought, although there are caveats to generalizing from past settings to individuals affected by ACA subsidies. We also find that part of the increase in subsidized coverage was offset by a decrease in unsubsidized non-group insurance.",Asako S.

Medicaid Increases Emergency-Department Use: Evidence from Oregon's Health Insurance Experiment,"In 2008, Oregon initiated a limited expansion of a Medicaid program for uninsured, low-income adults, drawing names from a waiting list by lottery. This lottery created a rare opportunity to study the effects of Medicaid coverage by using a randomized controlled design. By using the randomization provided by the lottery and emergency-department records from Portland-area hospitals, we studied the emergency department use of about 25,000 lottery participants over about 18 months after the lottery. We found that Medicaid coverage significantly increases overall emergency use by 0.41 visits per person, or 40% relative to an average of 1.02 visits per person in the control group. We found increases in emergency-department visits across a broad range of types of visits, conditions, and subgroups, including increases in visits for conditions that may be most readily treatable in primary care settings.",Amy Finkelstein; Amy N.

"Environment, Health, and Human Capital","In this review, we discuss three major contributions economists have made to our understanding of the relationship between the environment and individual well-being. First, in explicitly recognizing how optimizing behavior, particularly in the form of residential sorting, can lead to nonrandom assignment of pollution, economists have employed a wide range of quasi-experimental techniques to develop causal estimates of the effect of pollution. Second, economic research has placed a considerable focus on the role of avoidance behavior, which is an important component for understanding the difference between biological and behavioral effects of pollution and for proper welfare calculations. Lastly, economic research has expanded the focus of analysis beyond traditional health outcomes to include measures of human capital, including labor supply, productivity, and cognition. Our review of the quasi-experimental evidence on this topic suggests that pollution does indeed have a wide range of effects on individual well-being, even at levels well below current regulatory standards. Given the importance of health and human capital as an engine for economic growth, these findings underscore the role of environmental conditions as an important factor of production.

Health and Access to Care during the First 2 Years of the ACA Medicaid Expansions,"By September 2015, a total of 29 states and Washington, D.C., were participating in Medicaid expansions under the Affordable Care Act. We examined whether Medicaid expansions were associated with changes in insurance coverage, health care use, and health among low-income adults.We compared changes in outcomes during the 2 years after implementation of the Medicaid expansion (2014 and 2015) relative to the 4 years before expansion (2010 through 2013) in states with and without expansions, using data from the National Health Interview Survey. The sample consisted of 60,766 U.S. citizens who were 19 to 64 years of age and had incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level. Outcomes included insurance coverage, access to and use of medical care in the past 12 months, and health status as reported by the respondents.A total of 29 states and Washington, D.C., expanded Medicaid by September 1, 2015. In year 2 after implementation, uninsurance rates were reduced in expansion states relative to nonexpansion states (difference-in-differences estimate, -8.2 percentage points; P<0.001) and rates of Medicaid coverage were increased (difference-in-differences estimate, 15.6 percentage points; P<0.001). Expansions were not associated with significant changes in the likelihood of a doctor visit or overnight hospital stay or health status as reported by the respondent. However, as compared with nonexpansion states, expansion states had a decrease in reports of inability to afford needed follow-up care (difference-in-differences estimate, -3.4 percentage points; P=0.002) and in reports of worry about paying medical bills (difference-in-differences estimate, -7.9 percentage points; P=0.002) and an increase in reports of medical care being delayed because of wait times for appointments (difference-in-differences estimate, 2.6 percentage points; P=0.02).Medicaid expansion was associated with increased insurance coverage and access to care during the second year of implementation, but it was also associated with longer wait times for appointments, which suggests that challenges in access to care persist.",Laura R.

Do Risk Preferences Change? Evidence from the Great East Japan Earthquake,"We investigate whether individuals' risk preferences change after experiencing a natural disaster, specifically, the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. Exploiting the panels of nationally representative surveys on risk preferences, we find that men who experienced greater intensity of the earthquake became more risk tolerant a year after the Earthquake. Interestingly, the effects on men's risk preferences are persistent even five years after the Earthquake at almost the same magnitude as those shortly after the Earthquake. Furthermore, these men gamble more, which is consistent with the direction of changes in risk preferences. We find no such pattern for women.

CEO's age and the performance of closely held firms,"Research Summary Using detailed ownership and financial information from a large sample of owner‐managed private firms in three Western European countries, this paper examines the relationship between CEO's age and firm's performance. Tracking firms over time, we find that as a CEO ages, the firm experiences lower investment, lower sales growth, and lower profitability, but also higher probability of survival, suggesting a trade‐off between the managerial approaches of younger and older CEOs. These results are stronger in industries more reliant on human capital, such as service and creative industries. Our evidence also suggests that regional financial development moderates the relationship between a CEO's age and a firm's performance by facilitating the reallocation of assets from firms owned by older CEOs to firms owned by younger CEOs. Managerial Summary How do management styles change as CEOs grow older? Using a large firm‐level dataset, we examine the behavior and performance of firms with CEOs of different ages. We find that as a CEO grows older, firm investment, growth, and profitability decline, but probability of survival increases. The results are stronger in industries where human capital and creativity are more important. Regional financial development moderates the age–performance relationship by facilitating reallocation of assets from firms with old CEOs to firms with younger CEOs. Our findings suggest that management styles change with age, as older CEOs tend to emphasize survival at the expense of higher profits and faster growth.",Anastasiya Shamshur; Rebecca Zarutskie; Sharon Belenzon,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.3003,"Profitability index, Business, Investment (military), Human capital, Demographic economics, Sample (material), Monetary economics, Labour economics, Finance, Economics, Market economy, Chemistry, Chromatography, Politics, Political science, Law",Duke University; Federal Reserve; Charles University; Federal Reserve Board of Governors; Center for Economic Research and Graduate Education – Economics Institute; University of East Anglia,"NBER, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina; Division of Monetary Affairs, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, District of Columbia; CERGE-EI, Charles University and the Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic; Norwich Business School, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK","NBER, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina; Division of Monetary Affairs, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, District of Columbia; CERGE-EI, Charles University and the Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic; Norwich Business School, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK"
Firm-Level Upgrading in Developing Countries,"In principle, firms in developing countries benefit from the fact that advanced technologies and products have already been developed in industrialized countries and can simply be adopted, a process often referred to as industrial upgrading. But for many firms this advantage remains elusive. What is getting in the way? This paper reviews recent firm-level empirical research on the determinants of upgrading in developing countries. The first part focuses on how to define and measure various dimensions of upgrading—learning, quality upgrading, technology adoption, and product innovation. The second part takes stock of recent evidence on the drivers of upgrading, classifying them as output-side drivers, input-side drivers, or drivers of know-how. I conclude with some thoughts about promising directions for research in the area.

Pareto and Piketty: The Macroeconomics of Top Income and Wealth Inequality,"Since the early 2000s, research by Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez, and their coauthors has revolutionized our understanding of income and wealth inequality. In this paper, I highlight some of the key empirical facts from this research and comment on how they relate to macroeconomics and to economic theory more generally. One of the key links between data and theory is the Pareto distribution. The paper describes simple mechanisms that give rise to Pareto distributions for income and wealth and considers the economic forces that influence top inequality over time and across countries.

Nonparametric Counterfactual Predictions in Neoclassical Models of International Trade,"We develop a methodology to construct nonparametric counterfactual predictions, free of functional form restrictions on preferences and technology, in neoclassical models of international trade. First, we establish the equivalence between such models and reduced exchange models in which countries directly exchange factor services. This equivalence implies that, for an arbitrary change in trade costs, counterfactual changes in the factor content of trade, factor prices, and welfare only depend on the shape of a reduced factor demand system. Second, we provide sufficient conditions under which estimates of this system can be recovered nonparametrically. Together, these results offer a strict generalization of the parametric approach used in so-called gravity models. Finally, we use China's recent integration into the world economy to illustrate the feasibility and potential benefits of our approach.

Recent Declines in Labor's Share in US Income: A Preliminary Neoclassical Account,"As shown in the 1930s by Hicks and Robinson the elasticity of substitution ( σ) is a key parameter that captures whether capital and labor are gross complements or substitutes.Establishing the magnitude of σ is vital, not only for explaining changes in the distribution of income between factors but also for undertaking policy measures to influence it.Several papers have explained the recent decline in labor's share in income by claiming that σ is greater than one and that there has been capital deepening.This paper presents evidence that refutes these claims.It shows that despite a rise in measured capital-labor ratios, labor-augmenting technical change in the US has been sufficiently rapid that effective capital-labor ratios have actually fallen in the sectors and industries that account for the largest portion of the declining labor share in income since 1980.In combination with estimates that corroborate the consensus in the literature that σ is less than 1, these declines in the effective capital ratio can account for much of the recent fall in labor's share in US income at both the aggregate and industry level.Paradoxically, these results also suggest that increased capital formation would raise labor's share in income.",Robert Lawrence,,,,,,,,,,,,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w21296,"Economics, Labour economics, Demographic economics",National Bureau of Economic Research; John F.

Lack of Selection and Limits to Delegation: Firm Dynamics in Developing Countries,"Delegating managerial tasks is essential for firm growth. Most firms in developing countries, however, do not hire outside managers but instead rely on family members. In this paper, we ask if this lack of managerial delegation can explain why firms in poor countries are small and whether it has important aggregate consequences. We construct a model of firm growth where entrepreneurs have a fixed time endowment to run their daily operations. As firms grow large, the need to hire outside managers increases. Firms’ willingness to expand therefore depends on the ease with which delegation can take place. We calibrate the model to plant-level data from the United States and India. We identify the key parameters of our theory by targeting the experimental evidence on the effect of managerial practices on firm performance from Bloom et al. (2013). We find that inefficiencies in the delegation environment account for 11 percent of the income per capita difference between the United States and India. They also contribute to the small size of Indian producers, but would cause substantially more harm for US firms. The reason is that US firms are larger on average and managerial delegation is especially valuable for large firms, thus making delegation efficiency and other factors affecting firm growth complements.

Carry-Along Trade,"Large multi-product firms dominate international trade flows. Using novel linked production and export data at the firm-product level, we find that the overwhelming majority of manufacturing firms export products that they do not produce. Three quarters of the exported products and 30% of export value from Belgian manufacturers are in goods that are not produced by the firm, so-called Carry-Along Trade (CAT). The number of CAT products is strongly increasing in firm productivity while the number of produced products that are exported is weakly increasing in firm productivity. We propose a general model of production and sourcing at multi-product firms and explore new demand- and supply-side modelling features capable of generating predictions consistent with the empirical findings.

Impacts of incoming knowledge on product innovation: technology transfer in auto-related industries in developing economies,"This paper studies two questions on the role of networked sources of knowledge influential to product innovation. First, what is the extent of technology transferred through vertical linkages and public–private alliances, including university–industry linkages, in the phase of product improvement and development? Second, what types of knowledge are transferred from external technology sources? In a sample of ASEAN firms' self-reported partner data restricted to automotive-related industries, we found that direct linkages with multinational corporation (MNC) customers in foreign countries resulted in a lower propensity of product innovation. Indeed, incoming knowledge from MNC customers relating to the management of quality of existing products especially explained the lower propensity of product innovation. We also found that production linkages with MNC suppliers in foreign countries resulted in a higher propensity of product innovation. Incoming knowledge from MNC suppliers about quality controls explained a lower propensity of product innovation. These findings empirically indicate that networked sources of knowledge have a significant influence trade-off between maintaining existing operations and developing new products. The impacts of public–private alliances on innovation are sizable compared with the impacts of vertical linkages.

Do Prices Determine Vertical Integration?,"A number of theories in organizational economics and industrial organization suggest that vertical integration, while costly, increases productivity. It follows from firms' maximizing behaviour that higher prices in the product market ought to induce more integration. Trade policy provides a source of exogenous price variation to assess this prediction: higher tariffs should lead to higher prices and, therefore, to more integration. We construct firm-level vertical integration indices for a large set of countries and industries and exploit variation in applied most-favoured-nation tariffs to examine the impact of tariffs on firm boundaries. The empirical results provide strong support for the view that higher output prices generate more vertical integration. Our estimates of the average price elasticity of vertical integration are in the range 0.4–2.",Andrew F.

The Quality-Complementarity Hypothesis: Theory and Evidence from Colombia,"This paper presents a tractable formalization and an empirical investigation of the quality-complementarity hypothesis, the hypothesis that input quality and plant productivity are complementary in generating output quality.We embed this complementarity in a general-equilibrium trade model with heterogeneous, monopolistically competitive firms, extending Melitz (2003), and show that it generates distinctive implications for two simple, observable within-sector correlations --between output prices and plant size and between input prices and plant size --and for how those correlations vary across sectors.Using uniquely rich and representative data on the unit values of outputs and inputs of Colombian manufacturing plants, we then document three facts: (1) output prices are positively correlated with plant size within industries on average; (2) input prices are positively correlated with plant size within industries on average; and (3) both correlations are more positive in industries with more scope for quality differentiation, as measured by the advertising and R&D intensity of U.S. industries.The predicted and observed correlations between export status and input and output prices are similar to those for plant size.We present additional evidence that market power of either final-good producers or input suppliers does not fully explain the empirical patterns we observe.These findings are consistent with the predictions of our model and difficult to reconcile with alternative models that impose symmetry or homogeneity of either inputs or outputs.We interpret the results as broadly supportive of the quality-complementarity hypothesis.",Eric Verhoogen; Maurice Kugler; Maurice Kügler,,,,,,,,,,,,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w14418,"Complementarity (molecular biology), Quality (philosophy), Econometrics, Economics, Mathematical economics, Epistemology, Philosophy, Biology, Genetics",Wilfrid Laurier University; Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Harvard University Center for International Development 79 JFK Street Cambridge, MA 02138 and; Economic Research at Columbia University; Department of Economics Dept. of International & Public Affairs Columbia University 420 W. 118th Street New York, NY 10027; Wilfrid Laurier University","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Harvard University Center for International Development 79 JFK Street Cambridge, MA 02138 and; Economic Research at Columbia University; Department of Economics Dept. of International & Public Affairs Columbia University 420 W. 118th Street New York, NY 10027; Wilfrid Laurier University"
"Deregulation, Consolidation, and Efficiency: Evidence from US Nuclear Power","Beginning in the late 1990s, electricity markets in many US states were deregulated, and almost half of the nation's 103 nuclear power reactors were sold to independent power producers. Deregulation has been accompanied by substantial market consolidation, and today the three largest companies control one-third of US nuclear capacity. We find that deregulation and consolidation are associated with a 10 percent increase in operating performance, achieved primarily by reducing the duration of reactor outages. At average wholesale prices, this increased operating performance is worth $2.5 billion annually and implies an annual decrease of 35 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions.

Measuring Global Value Chains,"Recent decades have seen the emergence of global value chains (GVCs), in which production stages for individual goods are broken apart and scattered across countries. Stimulated by these developments, there has been rapid progress in data and methods for measuring GVC linkages. The macro approach to measuring GVCs connects national input–output tables across borders by using bilateral trade data to construct global input–output tables. These tables have been applied to measure trade in value added, the length of and location of producers in GVCs, and price linkages across countries. The micro approach uses firm-level data to document firms’ input sourcing decisions, how import and export participation are linked, and how multinational firms organize their production networks. In this review, I evaluate progress in these two approaches, highlighting points of contact between them and areas that demand further work. I argue that further convergence between these approaches can strengthen both, yielding a more complete empirical portrait of GVCs.",Robert C.

Multinational Firms and International Business Cycle Transmission*,"Abstract We investigate how multinational firms contribute to the transmission of shocks across countries using a large multicountry firm-level data set that contains cross-border ownership information. We use these data to document two novel empirical patterns. First, foreign affiliate and headquarter sales exhibit strong positive comovement: a 10% growth in the sales of the headquarter is associated with a 2% growth in the sales of the affiliate. Second, shocks to the source country account for a significant fraction of the variation in sales growth at the source-destination level. We propose a parsimonious quantitative model to interpret these findings and to evaluate the role of multinational firms for international business cycle transmission. For the typical country, the impact of foreign shocks transmitted by all foreign multinationals combined is non-negligible, accounting for about 10% of aggregate productivity shocks. On the other hand, since bilateral multinational production shares are small, interdependence between most individual country pairs is minimal. Our results do reveal substantial heterogeneity in the strength of this mechanism, with the most integrated countries significantly more affected by foreign shocks.",Andrei A.

The Effect of Employer Health Insurance Offering on the Growth and Survival of Small Business Prior to the Affordable Care Act,"Whether or not small businesses offer health insurance to their employees is a critical factor in the health care coverage of many Americans, yet many entrepreneurs and decision makers fear that the cost of offering health care coverage to their employees will diminish the growth and survival of small firms. While there is an emerging consensus among economists that small businesses both create and destroy a disproportionately large number of jobs, less is known about the relationship between health care costs and business growth. We examine this latter issue prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010.",Adela Luque; Alice M. Zawacki; Alice Zawacki; C.J.

Does Foreign Direct Investment Increase the Productivity of Domestic Firms? In Search of Spillovers through Backward Linkages,"No AccessPolicy Research Working Papers25 Jun 2013Does Foreign Direct Investment Increase the Productivity of Domestic Firms? In Search of Spillovers through Backward LinkagesAuthors/Editors: Beata SmarzynskaBeata Smarzynskahttps://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-2923SectionsAboutPDF (0.1 MB) ToolsAdd to favoritesDownload CitationsTrack Citations ShareFacebookTwitterLinked In Abstract:Many countries compete against one another in attracting foreign investors by offering ever more generous incentive packages and justifying their actions with the productivity gains that are expected to accrue to domestic producers from knowledge externalities generated by foreign affiliates. Despite this being hugely important to public policy choices, there is little conclusive evidence indicating that domestic firms benefit from foreign presence in their sector. It is possible, though, that researchers have been looking for foreign direct investment (FDI) spillovers in the wrong place. Multinationals have an incentive to prevent information leakage that would enhance the performance of their local competitors in the same industry but at the same time may want to transfer knowledge to their local suppliers in other sectors. Spillovers from FDI may be, therefore, more likely to take place through backward linkages—that is, contacts between domestic suppliers of intermediate inputs and their multinational clients—and thus would not have been captured by the earlier literature. This paper focuses on the understudied issue of FDI spillovers through backward linkages and goes beyond existing studies by shedding some light on factors driving this phenomenon. It also improves over existing literature by addressing several econometric problems that may have biased the results of earlier research. Based on a firm-level panel data set from Lithuania, the estimation results are consistent with the existence of productivity spillovers. They suggest that a 10 percent increase in the foreign presence in downstream sectors is associated with 0.38 percent rise in output of each domestic firm in the supplying industry. The data indicate that these spillovers are not restricted geographically, since local firms seem to benefit from the operation of downstream foreign affiliates on their own, as well as in other regions. The results further show that greater productivity benefits are associated with domestic-market, rather than export-oriented, foreign affiliates. But no difference is detected between the effects of fully-owned foreign firms and those with joint domestic and foreign ownership. The findings of a positive correlation between productivity growth of domestic firms and the increase in multinational presence in downstream sectors should not, however, be interpreted as a call for subsidizing FDI. These results are consistent with the existence of knowledge spillovers from foreign affiliates to their local suppliers, but they may also be a result of increased competition in upstream sectors. While the former case would call for offering FDI incentive packages, it would not be the optimal policy in the latter. Certainly more research is needed to disentangle these two effects. This paper—a product of Trade, Development Research Group—is part of a larger effort in the group to study the contribution of trade and foreign direct investment to technology transfer.

Determinants of Corporate Cash Policy: Insights from Private Firms,"We provide one of the first large sample comparisons of cash policies in public and private U.S. firms. We first show that despite higher financing frictions, private firms hold, on average, about half as much cash as public firms do. By examining the drivers of cash policies for each group, we are able to attribute the difference to the much higher agency costs in public firms. By combining evidence from across public and private firms as well as within public firms across different qualities of governance, we are able to reconcile existing mixed evidence on the effects of agency problems on cash policies. Specifically, agency problems affect not only the target level of cash, but also how managers react to cash in excess of the target.",Huasheng Gao; Jarrad Harford; Kai Li,,,,,,,,,,,,2012.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2023999,"Business, Corporate finance, Corporate governance, Finance, Financial system",University of British Columbia; European Corporate Governance Institute; University of Washington; Fudan University,"China Academy of Financial Research (CAFR); European Corporate Governance Institute (ECGI); University of Washington; Fanhai International School of Finance, Fudan University; Asian Bureau of Finance and Economic Research (ABFER); Canadian Sustainable Finance Network (CSFN); University of British Columbia (UBC) - Sauder School of Business","China Academy of Financial Research (CAFR); European Corporate Governance Institute (ECGI); University of Washington; Fanhai International School of Finance, Fudan University; Asian Bureau of Finance and Economic Research (ABFER); Canadian Sustainable Finance Network (CSFN); University of British Columbia (UBC) - Sauder School of Business"

Living Arrangements as an Indicator of the Integration of Older Ethnic Russian Immigrants in Estonia,"This study is about living arrangements of older ethnic Russians living in Estonia most of whom are long-term immigrants. Studies involving immigrant populations have suggested that the integration process would decrease their differences with the host population, including their living arrangement preferences. Our investigation shows that despite long-term residence in country, living arrangements’ pattern of ethnic Russians in Estonia is rather different from that of Estonians and that can be explained by low integration. The study is based on the microdata of the Estonian 2011 population and housing census and the 5% sample of the Russian 2010 census from the IPUMS database. In the first part of the analysis, we employ origin-destination perspective to comparing living arrangements of Russians in Estonia with Estonians and Russians in Russia.

"Protect, Serve, and Deport: The Rise of Policing as Immigration Enforcement","<i>Open access to this title is possible thanks to the generous support of Arcadia, a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin.</i> <i>Protect, Serve, and Deport</i> exposes the on-the-ground workings of local immigration enforcement in Nashville, Tennessee. Between 2007 and 2012, Nashville's local jail participated in an immigration enforcement program called 287(g), which turned jail employees into immigration officers who identified over ten thousand removable immigrants for deportation. The vast majority of those identified for removal were not serious criminals but Latino residents arrested by local police for minor violations. <i>Protect, Serve, and Deport</i> explains how local politics, state laws, institutional policies, and police practices work together to deliver immigrants into an expanding federal deportation system, conveying powerful messages about race, citizenship, and belonging. ""Amada Armenta artfully weaves participants' justifications for their actions with her own scholarly analysis, finding that bureaucratic priorities, relevant laws, and local norms all help officers distance themselves from the frequently grave consequences of their work.""

A hostile local immigrant-receptivity climate and alternative institutional community context indicators are integrated with individual-level data on physician and dental care from the 1996 and 2001 Survey of Income and Program Participation to explain this variation. Mexican immigrants’ children in new Hispanic immigrant destinations are 20 percent less likely to see a doctor, and a negative receptivity climate explains about half of this effect.

Data-driven anatomy of hierarchical migration patterns in the United States,"Population migration has become a dominant force in shaping local demographic changes in the United States, surpassing natural growth rates. However, whether the migration pattern and the influential factor have distinctive disparities between hierarchical county pairs is still elusive. This study delves into the spatial diversity and driving forces behind migration patterns at the county level, with a particular focus on the disparities through an examination of migration levels and scales. We utilize county-pair-level migration data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey to unveil the intricate network structure of population movement. Our findings reveal a pronounced spatial diversity in migration patterns, while cities witness a net influx of population, and in contrast to rural areas, majority of population inflow of cities primarily stems from metro areas. We employ Hierarchical Linear Models to analyze the impact of social connectedness, local wealthiness, and racial diversity on migration flows. The results highlight that cities with robust social networks, higher economic status, and balanced racial diversity are more attractive to migrants. Notably, the influence of racial diversity differences between origin and destination counties is found to be more significant in attracting migration compared to per capita income disparities. The findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners in managing demographic changes and addressing the challenges associated with migration-driven population redistribution. The study underscores the importance of considering social, economic, and racial factors in understanding and shaping migration patterns, with implications for regional development and social cohesion.",Chao Fan; Haoying Han; Xing Su; Xurui Yan,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2024.103825,"Geography, Cartography, Genealogy, Evolutionary biology, Anatomy, Data science, Biology, Computer science, History",Zhejiang University; Clemson University; City University of Macau,"School of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences, Clemson University, Clemson, SC 29634, USA; College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China; Faculty of Innovation and Design, City University of Macau, Macau","School of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences, Clemson University, Clemson, SC 29634, USA; College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China; Faculty of Innovation and Design, City University of Macau, Macau"
The Long-Term Effects of Africa's Slave Trades<sup>*</sup>,"Can part of Africa's current underdevelopment be explained by its slave trades? To explore this question, I use data from shipping records and historical documents reporting slave ethnicities to construct estimates of the number of slaves exported from each country during Africa's slave trades. I find a robust negative relationship between the number of slaves exported from a country and current economic performance. To better understand if the relationship is causal, I examine the historical evidence on selection into the slave trades and use instrumental variables. Together the evidence suggests that the slave trades had an adverse effect on economic development.",Nathan Nunn,,,,,,,,,,,,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.1162/qjec.2008.123.1.139,"Underdevelopment, Construct (python library), Term (time), Ethnic group, Economics, Development economics, Political science, Economic growth, Law, Computer science, Physics, Quantum mechanics, Programming language",National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,Harvard University and National Bureau of Economic Research,Harvard University and National Bureau of Economic Research
Ruggedness: The Blessing of Bad Geography in Africa,"We show that geography, through its impact on history, can have important effects on economic development today. The analysis focuses on the historic interaction between ruggedness and Africa's slave trades. Although rugged terrain hinders trade and most productive activities, negatively affecting income globally, rugged terrain within Africa afforded protection to those being raided during the slave trades. Since the slave trades retarded subsequent economic development, ruggedness within Africa has also had a historic indirect positive effect on income. Studying all countries worldwide, we estimate the differential effect of ruggedness on income for Africa. We show that the differential effect of ruggedness is statistically significant and economically meaningful, it is found in Africa only, it cannot be explained by other factors like Africa's unique geographic environment, and it is fully accounted for by the history of the slave trades.",Diego Puga; Nathan Nunn,,,,,,,,,,,,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00161,"Blessing, Terrain, Differential (mechanical device), Geography, Economic geography, Development economics, Economics, Cartography, Archaeology, Engineering, Aerospace engineering",Bread for the World Institute; Center for Economic and Policy Research; Madrid Institute for Advanced Studies; Harvard University,"IMDEA Social Sciences Institute and CEPR; Harvard University, NBER, and BREAD","IMDEA Social Sciences Institute and CEPR; Harvard University, NBER, and BREAD"
"Clientelism, Credibility, and the Policy Choices of Young Democracies","This article identifies for the first time systematic performance differences between younger and older democracies and argues that these are driven by the inability of political competitors to make broadly credible preelectoral promises to voters. Younger democracies are more corrupt; exhibit less rule of law, lower levels of bureaucratic quality and secondary school enrollment, and more restrictions on the media; and spend more on public investment and government workers. This pattern is exactly consistent with the predictions of Keefer and Vlaicu (n.d.) . The inability of political competitors to make credible promises to citizens leads them to prefer clientelist policies: to underprovide nontargeted goods, to overprovide targeted transfers to narrow groups of voters, and to engage in excessive rent seeking. Other differences that young democracies exhibit, including different political and electoral institutions, greater exposure to political violence, and greater social fragmentation, do not explain, either theoretically or empirically, these policy choices .",Philip Keefer,,,,,,,,,,,,2007.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00282.x,"Clientelism, Credibility, Competitor analysis, Politics, Bureaucracy, Political economy, Political science, Government (linguistics), Economics, Democracy, Law, Linguistics, Philosophy, Management",World Bank,The World Bank,The World Bank
How Deep Are the Roots of Economic Development?,"The empirical literature on economic growth and development has moved from the study of proximate determinants to the analysis of ever deeper, more fundamental factors, rooted in long-term history. A growing body of new empirical work focuses on the measurement and estimation of the effects of historical variables on contemporary income by explicitly taking into account the ancestral composition of current populations. The evidence suggests that economic development is affected by traits that have been transmitted across generations over the very long run. This article surveys this new literature and provides a framework to discuss different channels through which intergenerationally transmitted characteristics may impact economic development, biologically (via genetic or epigenetic transmission) and culturally (via behavioral or symbolic transmission). An important issue is whether historically transmitted traits have affected development through their direct impact on productivity, or have operated indirectly as barriers to the diffusion of productivity-enhancing innovations across populations.

Using the matrix to adjust indicators of early development so that they reflect the history of a population's ancestors rather than the history of the place they live today greatly improves the ability of those indicators to predict current GDP. The variance of the early development history of a country's inhabitants is a good predictor for current inequality, with ethnic groups originating in regions having longer histories of organized states tending to be at the upper end of a country's income distribution.",D.

The Natural Resource Curse: A Survey,"It is striking how often countries with oil or other natural resource wealth have failed to grow more rapidly than those without.This is the phenomenon known as the Natural Resource Curse.The principle has been borne out in some econometric tests of the determinants of economic performance across a comprehensive sample of countries.This paper considers six aspects of commodity wealth, each of interest in its own right, but each also a channel that some have suggested could lead to sub-standard economic performance.They are: long-term trends in world commodity prices, volatility, crowding out of manufacturing, civil war, poor institutions, and the Dutch Disease.Skeptics have questioned the Natural Resource Curse, pointing to examples of commodity-exporting countries that have done well and arguing that resource endowments and booms are not exogenous.The paper concludes with a consideration of institutions and policies that some commodity-producers have tried, in efforts to overcome the pitfalls of the Curse.Ideas include indexation of oil contracts, hedging of export proceeds, denomination of debt in terms of oil, Chile-style fiscal rules, a monetary target that emphasizes product prices, transparent commodity funds, and lump-sum distribution.",Jeffrey A.

Do Family Policies Reduce Gender Inequality? Evidence from 60 Years of Policy Experimentation,"Do family policies reduce gender inequality in the labor market?We contribute to this debate by investigating the joint impact of parental leave and child care, using administrative data covering the labor market and birth histories of Austrian workers over more than half a century.We start by quasi-experimentally identifying the causal effects of all family policy reforms since the 1950s, including the introduction of maternal leave benefits in 1961, on the full dynamics of male and female earnings.We then use these causal estimates to compute gender inequality series for counterfactual scenarios regarding the evolution of family policies.Our results show that the enormous expansions of parental leave and child care subsidies have had virtually no impact on gender convergence.",Andreas Steinhauer; Camille Landais; Henrik Kleven; Johanna Posch; Josef Zweimüller,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w28082,"Inequality, Gender inequality, Economics, Public economics, Demographic economics, Psychology, Mathematics, Mathematical analysis",Stockholm University; Analysis Group (United States); Princeton University; University of Reading; Tinbergen Institute; University of Salzburg; London School of Economics and Political Science; University of Zurich; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Edinburgh; Bank of Italy; National Bank of Belgium,"University of Reading, Stockholm University, University of Salzburg, Tinbergen Institute; Department of Economics Princeton University 238 Julis Romo Rabinowitz Building Princeton, NJ 08544; University of Edinburgh 31 Buccleuch Place Edinburgh EH8 9JT United Kingdom; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of Zurich Schoenberggasse 1 8001, Zurich Switzerland; Bocconi, Crest-Ecole Polytechnique, EIEF, OeGB Innsbruck, PSE, National Bank of Belgium,; Analysis Group; seminar participants at the AEA Meetings 2019, Bank of Italy, UC Berkeley,; Department of Economics London School of Economics Houghton Street London WC2A 2AE United Kingdom;  Angel Court London EC2R 7HJ UK","University of Reading, Stockholm University, University of Salzburg, Tinbergen Institute; Department of Economics Princeton University 238 Julis Romo Rabinowitz Building Princeton, NJ 08544; University of Edinburgh 31 Buccleuch Place Edinburgh EH8 9JT United Kingdom; Department of Economics London School of Economics Houghton Street London WC2A 2AE United Kingdom; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of Zurich Schoenberggasse 1 8001, Zurich Switzerland; Bocconi, Crest-Ecole Polytechnique, EIEF, OeGB Innsbruck, PSE, National Bank of Belgium,; seminar participants at the AEA Meetings 2019, Bank of Italy, UC Berkeley,; Analysis Group;  Angel Court London EC2R 7HJ UK"

"Connecting to Power: Political Connections, Innovation, and Firm Dynamics","How do political connections affect firm dynamics, innovation, and creative destruction? We extend a Schumpeterian growth model with political connections that help firms ease bureaucratic and regulatory burden. The model highlights how political connections influence an economy's business dynamism and innovation, and generates a number of implications guiding our empirical analysis. We construct a new large‐scale data set for the period 1993–2014, on the universe of firms, workers, and politicians, complemented with corporate financial statements, patent data, and election data, so as to define connected firms as those employing local politicians. We identify a leadership paradox: market leaders are much more likely to be politically connected, but much less likely to innovate. Political connections relate to a higher rate of survival, as well as growth in employment and revenues, but not in productivity—a result that we also confirm using the regression discontinuity design. At the aggregate level, gains from political connections do not offset losses stemming from lower reallocation and growth.",Francesca Lotti; Salomé Baslandze; Ufuk Akcigit,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.3982/ecta18338,"Dynamism, Politics, Creative destruction, Economics, Bureaucracy, Revenue, Construct (python library), Productivity, Economic system, Industrial organization, Microeconomics, Market economy, Finance, Macroeconomics, Political science, Physics, Quantum mechanics, Computer science, Law, Programming language",Bank of Italy; Center for Economic and Policy Research; University of Chicago,"Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and CEPR FRANCESCA LOTTI Bank of Italy; Department of Economics, University of Chicago, NBER, and CEPR; Bank of Italy","Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and CEPR FRANCESCA LOTTI Bank of Italy; Department of Economics, University of Chicago, NBER, and CEPR; Bank of Italy"
"AI Adoption in America: Who, What, and Where","We study the early adoption and diffusion of five AI-related technologies (automated-guided vehicles, machine learning, machine vision, natural language processing, and voice recognition) as documented in the 2018 Annual Business Survey of 850,000 firms across the United States. We find that fewer than 6% of firms used any of the AI-related technologies we measure, though most very large firms reported at least some AI use. Weighted by employment, average adoption was just over 18%. AI use in production, while varying considerably by industry, nevertheless was found in every sector of the economy and clustered with emerging technologies such as cloud computing and robotics. Among dynamic young firms, AI use was highest alongside more-educated, more-experienced, and younger owners, including owners motivated by bringing new ideas to market or helping the community. AI adoption was also more common alongside indicators of high-growth entrepreneurship, including venture capital funding, recent product and process innovation, and growth-oriented business strategies. Early adoption was far from evenly distributed: a handful of ""superstar"" cities and emerging hubs led startups' adoption of AI. These patterns of early AI use foreshadow economic and social impacts far beyond this limited initial diffusion, with the possibility of a growing ""AI divide"" if early patterns persist.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",Emin Dinlersoz; Erik Brynjolfsson; J.

"Back to Basics: Basic Research Spillovers, Innovation Policy, and Growth","Abstract This article introduces a general equilibrium model of endogenous technical change through basic and applied research. Basic research differs from applied research in the nature and the magnitude of the generated spillovers. We propose a novel way of empirically identifying these spillovers and embed them in a framework with private firms and a public research sector. After characterizing the equilibrium, we estimate our model using micro-level data on research expenditures by French firms. Our key finding is that uniform research subsidies can accentuate the dynamic misallocation in the economy by oversubsidizing applied research. Policies geared towards public basic research and its interaction with the private sector are significantly welfare-improving.",Douglas Hanley; Nicolas Serrano-Velarde; Ufuk Akcigit,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdaa061,"Subsidy, Economics, Endogenous growth theory, Welfare, Basic research, Private sector, General equilibrium theory, Industrial organization, Applied research, Public sector, Microeconomics, Public economics, Macroeconomics, Economy, Computer science, Market economy, Economic growth, Human capital, Library science, Philosophy, Epistemology",Bocconi University; University of Pittsburgh; Center for Economic and Policy Research; University of Chicago,"Bocconi University, IGIER; University of Pittsburgh; University of Chicago, CEPR, NBER","Bocconi University, IGIER; University of Pittsburgh; University of Chicago, CEPR, NBER"
What Happened to U.S. Business Dynamism?,"In the past several decades, the U.S. economy has witnessed a number of striking trends that indicate a rising market concentration and a slowdown in business dynamism.In this paper, we make an attempt to understand potential common forces behind these empirical regularities through the lens of a micro-founded general equilibrium model of endogenous firm dynamics.Importantly, the theoretical model captures the strategic behavior between competing firms, its effect on their innovation decisions, and the resulting ""best versus the rest"" dynamics.We focus on multiple potential mechanisms that can potentially drive the observed changes and use the calibrated model to assess the relative importance of these channels with particular attention to the implied transitional dynamics.Our results highlight the dominant role of a decline in the intensity of knowledge diffusion from the frontier firms to the laggard ones in explaining the observed shifts.We conclude by presenting new evidence that corroborates a declining knowledge diffusion in the economy.We document a higher concentration of patenting in the hands of firms with the largest stock and a changing nature of patents, especially in the post-2000 period, which suggests a heavy use of intellectual property protection by market leaders to limit the diffusion of knowledge.These findings present a potential avenue for future research on the drivers of declining knowledge diffusion.",Sina Ates; Ufuk Akcigit,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w25756,"Dynamism, Economics, Frontier, Stock (firearms), Slowdown, Empirical evidence, Stock market, Knowledge economy, Economic geography, Economy, Economic growth, Political science, Geography, Philosophy, Epistemology, Context (archaeology), Physics, Archaeology, Quantum mechanics, Law",Federal Reserve Board of Governors; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago,"NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of Chicago 1126 East 59th Street Saieh Hall, Office 403 Chicago, IL 60637 and; Federal Reserve Board of Governors 20th & C St. Washington, DC 20551","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of Chicago 1126 East 59th Street Saieh Hall, Office 403 Chicago, IL 60637 and; Federal Reserve Board of Governors 20th & C St. Washington, DC 20551"

Technological Change and the Make-or-Buy Decision,"A central decision faced by firms is whether to make intermediate components internally or to buy them from specialized producers. We argue that firms producing products for which rapid technological change is characteristic will benefit from outsourcing to avoid the risk of not recouping their sunk cost investments when new production technologies appear. This risk is exacerbated when firms produce for low volume internal use, and is mitigated for those firms that sell to larger markets. Hence, products characterized by higher rates of technological change will be more likely to be produced by mass specialized firms to which other firms outsource production. Using a 1990–2002 panel data set on Spanish firms and an exogenous proxy for technological change, we provide causal evidence that technological change increases the likelihood of outsourcing.

More than an Ivory Tower: The Impact of Research Institutions on the Quantity and Quality of Entrepreneurship,"This paper provides systematic empirical evidence for the distinctive role of universities on local entrepreneurial ecosystems.Assessing the impact of research institutions on entrepreneurship is challenging, given that these institutions are often located in economic and innovation environments conducive to growth-oriented entrepreneurial activity, are themselves a source of local demand, and produce knowledge, which might serve as the foundation for new ventures.To overcome this inference challenge, we first combine comprehensive business registration records with a predictive analytics approach to measure both the quantity and quality-adjusted quantity of entrepreneurship at the zip-code level on an annual basis.We then link each location to the presence or absence of research-oriented universities or national laboratories.Finally, we exploit significant changes over time in Federal commitments to both universities and national laboratories.Our key finding is that changes in Federal research commitments to universities are uniquely linked to positively correlated changes in the quality-adjusted quantity of entrepreneurship.In contrast, increases in non-research funding to universities and funding to national laboratories is associated with either a neutral or negative impact on the quality-adjusted quantity of entrepreneurship.Research funding to universities seems to play a unique role in promoting the acceleration of local entrepreneurial ecosystems.",Scott Stern; Valentina Tartari,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w28846,"Ivory tower, Entrepreneurship, Quality (philosophy), Tower, Business, Engineering, Political science, Civil engineering, Physics, Law, Finance, Quantum mechanics",Copenhagen Business School; National Bureau of Economic Research,"MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main Street, E62-476 Cambridge, MA 02142; seminar participants at Copenhagen Business School, DRUID, the AIEA-NBER; Copenhagen Business School Kilevej 14A 2000 Frederiksberg Denmark; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138","MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main Street, E62-476 Cambridge, MA 02142; seminar participants at Copenhagen Business School, DRUID, the AIEA-NBER; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Copenhagen Business School Kilevej 14A 2000 Frederiksberg Denmark"
Is higher education more important for firms than research? Disentangling university spillovers,"Abstract The paper is the first attempt to integrate microdata on universities and firms across most European countries in order to disentangle the impact of knowledge spillovers from human capital (graduates) and intellectual capital (codified research output) on the performance of firms. Data cover all Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) registered in the official European Tertiary Education Register (ETER). Data on performance of firms are from ORBIS and refer to change in the 2011–2015 period in turnover, total assets, intangible assets, and employment. Firms are georeferred and the spillovers from all HEIs located at a given distance are summed and integrated. The findings suggest that, among knowledge spillovers, the creation of human capital via education of students has a larger impact than the circulation of research knowledge. Moreover, the two factors seem to be complements rather than substitutes. Spatial proximity is important for embodied knowledge spillovers (i.e. educated people), while for codified and disembodied spillovers (citations to publications) the spatial dimension is less relevant. The findings have important managerial and policy-making consequences.",Andrea Bonaccorsi; Federico Biagi; Laura Barin; Mabel Sanchez-Barrioluengo; Mabel Sánchez‐Barrioluengo; Paola Belingheri,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10961-023-10008-y,"Microdata (statistics), Human capital, Higher education, Intellectual capital, Order (exchange), Dimension (graph theory), Business, Embodied cognition, Intellectual property, Economics, Economic geography, Demographic economics, Political science, Economic growth, Finance, Sociology, Census, Population, Demography, Mathematics, Artificial intelligence, Computer science, Pure mathematics, Law",University of Manchester; Joint Research Centre; University of Pisa,"JRC Directorate B ""Fair and Sustainable Economy"", Unit B.6 ""Industrial strategy, skills, and technology transfer"" , European Commission, Joint Research Centre, Ispra, Italy; IRVAPP-FBK, Vicolo Dalla Piccola 12, 38122, Trento, Italy; Manchester Institute of Innovation Research, Alliance Manchester Business School, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK; School of Engineering,  University of Pisa, Largo Lucio Lazzarino 2, 56122, Pisa, Italy","JRC Directorate B ""Fair and Sustainable Economy"", Unit B.6 ""Industrial strategy, skills, and technology transfer"" , European Commission, Joint Research Centre, Ispra, Italy; IRVAPP-FBK, Vicolo Dalla Piccola 12, 38122, Trento, Italy; Manchester Institute of Innovation Research, Alliance Manchester Business School, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK; School of Engineering,  University of Pisa, Largo Lucio Lazzarino 2, 56122, Pisa, Italy"

The Logic of Agglomeration,This review discusses frontier topics in economic geography as they relate to firms and agglomeration economies.We focus on areas where empirical research is scarce but possible.We first outline a conceptual framework for city formation that allows us to contemplate what empiricists might study when using firm-level data to compare the functioning of cities and industries with each other.We then examine a second model of the internal structure of a cluster to examine possibilities with firm-level data for better exposing the internal operations of clusters.An overwhelming theme of our review is the vast scope for enhancements of our picture of agglomeration with the new data that are emerging.,Gilles Duranton; William Kerr; William R.

The Effect of ­High-Tech Clusters on the Productivity of Top Inventors,"The high-tech sector is concentrated in a small number of cities. The ten largest clusters in computer science, semiconductors, and biology account for 69 percent, 77 percent, and 59 percent of all US inventors, respectively. Using longitudinal data on 109,846 inventors, I find that geographical agglomeration results in significant productivity gains. When an inventor moves to a city with a large cluster of inventors in the same field, she experiences a sizable increase in the number and quality of patents produced. The presence of significant productivity externalities implies that the agglomeration of inventors generates large gains in the aggregate amount of innovation produced in the United States.

Proximate (Co-)Working: Knowledge Spillovers and Social Interactions,"We examine the influence of physical proximity on between-start-up knowledge spillovers at one of the largest technology coworking hubs in the United States. Relying on the exogenous assignment of office space to the hub’s 251 start-ups, we find that proximity positively influences knowledge spillovers as proxied by the likelihood of adopting an upstream web technology already used by a peer start-up. This effect is largest for start-ups within close proximity of each other and quickly decays; start-ups more than 20 meters apart on the same floor are indistinguishable from start-ups on different floors. The main driver of the effect appears to be social interactions. Although start-ups in close proximity are most likely to participate in social coworking space events together, knowledge spillovers are greatest between start-ups that socialize but are dissimilar. Ultimately, start-ups that are embedded in environments that have neither too much nor too little diversity perform better but only if they socialize.

Accelerating Innovation Ecosystems: The Promise and Challenges of Regional Innovation Engines,"Motivated by the establishment of major U.S. Federal programs seeking to harness the potential of regional innovation ecosystems, we assess the promise and challenges of place-based innovation policy interventions.Relative to traditional research grants, place-based innovation policy interventions are not directed toward a specific research project but rather aim to reshape interactions among researchers and other stakeholders within a given geographic location.The most recent such policy -the NSF ""Engines"" program -is designed to enhance the productivity and impact of the investments made within a given regional innovation ecosystem.The impact of such an intervention depends on whether, in its implementation, it induces change in the behavior of individuals and the ways in which knowledge is distributed and translated within that ecosystem.While this logic is straightforward, from it follows an important insight: innovation ecosystem interventions -Engines --are more likely to succeed when they account for the current state of a given regional ecosystem (latent capacities, current bottlenecks, and economic and institutional constraints) and when they involve extended commitments by multiple stakeholders within that ecosystem.We synthesize the logic, key dependencies, and opportunities for realtime assessment and course correction for these place-based innovation policy interventions.",Fiona Murray; Heidi Williams; Jorge Guzman; Jorge Guzmán; Scott Stern,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w31541,"Ecosystem, Business, Environmental resource management, Environmental science, Ecology, Biology",National Bureau of Economic Research; Dartmouth College,"Columbia Business School Kravis Hall, 975 655 W 130th St New York, NY 10027 and; MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main Street, E62-470 Cambridge, MA 02142; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main Street, E62-476 Cambridge, MA 02142; Department of Economics 6106 Rockefeller Center, Office 328 Dartmouth College Hanover, NH 03755","Columbia Business School Kravis Hall, 975 655 W 130th St New York, NY 10027 and; MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main Street, E62-470 Cambridge, MA 02142; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main Street, E62-476 Cambridge, MA 02142; Department of Economics 6106 Rockefeller Center, Office 328 Dartmouth College Hanover, NH 03755"
The China Shock: Learning from Labor-Market Adjustment to Large Changes in Trade,"China's emergence as a great economic power has induced an epochal shift in patterns of world trade. Simultaneously, it has challenged much of the received empirical wisdom about how labor markets adjust to trade shocks. Alongside the heralded consumer benefits of expanded trade are substantial adjustment costs and distributional consequences. These impacts are most visible in the local labor markets in which the industries exposed to foreign competition are concentrated. Adjustment in local labor markets is remarkably slow, with wages and labor-force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated for at least a full decade after the China trade shock commences. Exposed workers experience greater job churning and reduced lifetime income. At the national level, employment has fallen in the US industries more exposed to import competition, as expected, but offsetting employment gains in other industries have yet to materialize.

THE MAGNITUDE AND CAUSES OF AGGLOMERATION ECONOMIES,"ABSTRACT Firms and workers are much more productive in large and dense urban environments. There is substantial evidence of such agglomeration economies based on three approaches. First, on a clustering of production beyond what can be explained by chance or comparative advantage. Second, on spatial patterns in wages and rents. Third, on systematic variations in productivity with the urban environment. However, more needs to be learned about the causes of agglomeration economies. We have good models of agglomeration through sharing and matching, but not a deep enough understanding of learning in cities. Despite recent progress, more work is needed to distinguish empirically between alternative causes.",Diego Puga,,,,,,,,,,,,2010.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9787.2009.00657.x,"Economies of agglomeration, Productivity, Economics, Economic geography, Economic rent, Matching (statistics), Work (physics), Production (economics), Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Mechanical engineering, Statistics, Mathematics, Engineering",Madrid Institute for Advanced Studies,"Madrid Institute for Advanced Studies (IMDEA), Social Science and CEPR, Antiguo pabellón central del Hospital de Cantoblanco, Carretera de Colmenar Viejo km. 14, 28049 Madrid, Spain.

Import Competition and the Great US Employment Sag of the 2000s,"Even before the Great Recession, US employment growth was unimpressive. Between 2000 and 2007, the economy gave back the considerable employment gains achieved during the 1990s, with a historic contraction in manufacturing employment being a prime contributor to the slump. We estimate that import competition from China, which surged after 2000, was a major force behind both recent reductions in US manufacturing employment and—through input-output linkages and other general equilibrium channels—weak overall US job growth. Our central estimates suggest job losses from rising Chinese import competition over 1999–2011 in the range of 2.0–2.4 million.",Brendan M.

"Carbon Taxes, Path Dependency, and Directed Technical Change: Evidence from the Auto Industry","Can directed technical change be used to combat climate change? We construct new firm-level panel data on auto industry innovation distinguishing between ""dirty"" (internal combustion engine) and ""clean"" (e.g., electric, hybrid, and hydrogen) patents across 80 countries over several decades. We show that firms tend to innovate more in clean (and less in dirty) technologies when they face higher tax-inclusive fuel prices. Furthermore, there is path dependence in the type of innovation (clean/dirty) both from aggregate spillovers and from the firm's own innovation history. We simulate the increases in carbon taxes needed to allow clean technologies to overtake dirty technologies.",Antoine Dechezleprêtre; David Hémous; John Van Reenen; Philippe Aghion; Ralf Martin,,,,,,,,,,,,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.1086/684581,"Clean technology, Path dependency, Technical change, Auto industry, Carbon tax, Industrial organization, Panel data, Climate change, Path (computing), Face (sociological concept), Economics, Construct (python library), Technological change, Business, Natural resource economics, Economic system, Computer science, Econometrics, Engineering, Macroeconomics, Ecology, Automotive industry, Biology, Productivity, Programming language, Aerospace engineering, Social science, Sociology, Political science, Law",Canadian Institute for Advanced Research; London School of Economics and Political Science; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Centre for Economic Performance, London School of Economics, and National Bureau of Economic Research; Grantham Research Institute and Centre for Economic Performance, London School of Economics; Imperial College, Grantham Institute, and Centre for Economic Performance, London School of Economics; INSEAD; Harvard University, National Bureau of Economic Research, and Canadian Institute for Advanced Research","Centre for Economic Performance, London School of Economics, and National Bureau of Economic Research; Grantham Research Institute and Centre for Economic Performance, London School of Economics; Imperial College, Grantham Institute, and Centre for Economic Performance, London School of Economics; INSEAD; Harvard University, National Bureau of Economic Research, and Canadian Institute for Advanced Research"
The Cost of Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"Most countries, including the United States, have an array of greenhouse gas mitigation policies, which provide subsidies or restrictions typically aimed at specific technologies or sectors. Such climate policies range from automobile fuel economy standards, to gasoline taxes, to mandating that a certain amount of electricity in a state comes from renewables, to subsidizing solar and wind electrical generation, to mandates requiring the blending of biofuels into the surface transportation fuel supply, to supply-side restrictions on fossil fuel extraction. This paper reviews the costs of various technologies and actions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Our aim is twofold. First, we seek to provide an up-to-date summary of costs of actions that can be taken now using currently available technology. These costs focus on expenditures and emissions reductions over the life of a project compared to some business-as-usual benchmark—for example, replacing coal-fired electricity generation with wind, or weatherizing a home. We refer to these costs as static because they are costs over the life of a specific project undertaken now, and they ignore spillovers. Our second aim is to distinguish between dynamic and static costs and to argue that some actions taken today with seemingly high static costs can have low dynamic costs, and vice versa. We make this argument at a general level and through two case studies, of solar panels and of electric vehicles, technologies whose costs have fallen sharply. Under the right circumstances, dynamic effects will offer a justification for policies that have high costs according to a myopic calculation.",James H.

Innovation and Top Income Inequality,"Abstract In this article, we use cross-state panel and cross-U.S. commuting-zone data to look at the relationship between innovation, top income inequality and social mobility. We find positive correlations between measures of innovation and top income inequality. We also show that the correlations between innovation and broad measures of inequality are not significant. Next, using instrumental variable analysis, we argue that these correlations at least partly reflect a causality from innovation to top income shares. Finally, we show that innovation, particularly by new entrants, is positively associated with social mobility, but less so in local areas with more intense lobbying activities.",Antonin Bergeaud; David Hemous; David Hémous; Philippe Aghion; Richard Blundell; Ufuk Akcigit,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdy027,"Economics, Inequality, Causality (physics), Economic inequality, Instrumental variable, Panel data, Social mobility, Income inequality metrics, Income distribution, Demographic economics, Variable (mathematics), Econometrics, Labour economics, Sociology, Mathematics, Physics, Quantum mechanics, Mathematical analysis, Social science",Institute for Fiscal Studies; Paris School of Economics; Banque de France; University of Zurich; Center for Economic and Policy Research; University of Chicago; Collège de France; University College London,"College de France and London School of Economics; Banque de France; University of Zurich and CEPR; University College London and Institute for Fiscal Studies; University of Chicago, CEPR and NBER","College de France and London School of Economics; Banque de France; University of Zurich and CEPR; University College London and Institute for Fiscal Studies; University of Chicago, CEPR and NBER"
Ten Facts on Declining Business Dynamism and Lessons from Endogenous Growth Theory,"In this paper, we review the literature on declining business dynamism and its implications in the United States and propose a unifying theory to analyze the symptoms and the potential causes of this decline. We first highlight 10 pronounced stylized facts related to declining business dynamism documented in the literature and discuss some of the existing attempts to explain them. We then describe a theoretical framework of endogenous markups, innovation, and competition that can potentially speak to all of these facts jointly. We next explore some theoretical predictions of this framework, which are shaped by two interacting forces: a composition effect that determines the market concentration and an incentive effect that determines how firms respond to a given concentration in the economy. The results highlight that a decline in knowledge diffusion between frontier and laggard firms could be a significant driver of empirical trends observed in the data. This study emphasizes the potential of growth theory for the analysis of factors behind declining business dynamism and the need for further investigation in this direction.

What Happened to US Business Dynamism?,"We attempt to understand potential common forces behind rising market concentration and a slowdown in business dynamism in the US economy, through a micro-founded general equilibrium model of endogenous firm dynamics. The model captures the strategic behavior between competing firms, its effect on their innovation decisions, and the resulting ""best-versus-the-rest"" dynamics. We consider multiple potential mechanisms that can drive the observed changes and use the calibrated model to assess their relative importance, with particular attention to the implied transitional dynamics. Our results highlight the dominant role of a decline in the intensity of knowledge diffusion from frontier firms to laggard ones. We present new evidence that corroborates a declining knowledge diffusion in the economy.",Sina Ates; Sina T.

Credit Supply and the Price of Housing,"An exogenous expansion in mortgage credit has significant effects on house prices. This finding is established using US branching deregulations between 1994 and 2005 as instruments for credit. Credit increases for deregulated banks, but not in placebo samples. Such differential responses rule out demand-based explanations, and identify an exogenous credit supply shock. Because of geographic diver-sification, treated banks expand credit: housing demand increases, house prices rise, but to a lesser extent in areas with elastic housing supply, where the housing stock increases instead. In an instrumental variable sense, house prices are well explained by the credit expansion induced by deregulation.

Seeking the Roots of Entrepreneurship: Insights from Behavioral Economics,"There is a growing body of evidence that many entrepreneurs seem to enter and persist in entrepreneurship despite earning low risk-adjusted returns. This has lead to attempts to provide explanations—using both standard economic theory and behavioral economics— for why certain individuals may be attracted to such an apparently unprofitable activity. Drawing on research in behavioral economics, in the sections that follow, we review three sets of possible interpretations for understanding the empirical facts related to the entry into, and persistence in, entrepreneurship. Differences in risk aversion provide a plausible and intuitive interpretation of entrepreneurial activity. In addition, a growing literature has begun to highlight the potential importance of overconfidence in driving entrepreneurial outcomes. Such a mechanism may appear at face value to work like a lower level of risk aversion, but there are clear conceptual differences—in particular, overconfidence likely arises from behavioral biases and misperceptions of probability distributions. Finally, nonpecuniary taste-based factors may be important in motivating both the decisions to enter into and to persist in entrepreneurship.",Holger Herz; Ramana Nanda; Roberto A. Weber; Thomas B.

Access to Collateral and the Democratization of Credit: France's Reform of the Napoleonic Security Code,"ABSTRACT France's Ordonnance 2006‐346 repudiated the notion of possessory ownership in the Napoleonic Code, easing the pledge of physical assets in a country where credit was highly concentrated. A differences‐test strategy shows that firms operating newly pledgeable assets significantly increased their borrowing following the reform. Small, young, and financially constrained businesses benefitted the most, observing improved credit access and real‐side outcomes. Start‐ups emerged with higher “at‐inception” leverage, located farther from large cities, with more assets‐in‐place than before. Their exit and bankruptcy rates declined. Spatial analyses show that the reform reached firms in rural areas, reducing credit access inequality across France's countryside.",KEVIN ARETZ; Kevin Aretz; MARIA‐TERESA MARCHICA; MURILLO CAMPELLO; Maria‐Teresa Marchica; Murillo Campello,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.12846,"Pledge, Collateral, Leverage (statistics), Bankruptcy, Business, Working capital, Inequality, Democratization, Rural area, Financial system, Finance, Economics, Monetary economics, Democracy, Political science, Mathematical analysis, Mathematics, Machine learning, Politics, Computer science, Law",University of Hong Kong; Cornell University,"Cornell University - The Johnson School; Kevin Aretz is at Alliance Manchester Business School.

These aggregate indicators are based on hundreds of specific and disaggregated individual variables measuring various dimensions of governance, taken from 35 data sources provided by 33 different organizations. The data reflect the views on governance of public sector, private sector and NGO experts, as well as thousands of citizen and firm survey respondents worldwide. The authors also explicitly report the margins of error accompanying each country estimate. These reflect the inherent difficulties in measuring governance using any kind of data. They find that even after taking margins of error into account, the WGI permit meaningful cross-country comparisons as well as monitoring progress over time. The aggregate indicators, together with the disaggregated underlying indicators, are available at www.govindicators.org.

Estimates of the Trade and Welfare Effects of NAFTA,"We build into a Ricardian model sectoral linkages, trade in intermediate goods, and sectoral heterogeneity in production to quantify the trade and welfare effects from tariff changes. We also propose a new method to estimate sectoral trade elasticities consistent with any trade model that delivers a multiplicative gravity equation. We apply our model and use our estimated elasticities to identify the impact of NAFTA's tariff reductions. We find that Mexico's welfare increases by 1.31%, U.S.'s welfare increases by 0.08%, and Canada's welfare declines by 0.06%. We find that intra-bloc trade increases by 118% for Mexico, 11% for Canada, and 41% for the U.S. We show that welfare effects from tariff reductions are reduced when the structure of production does not take into account intermediate goods or input–output linkages. Our results highlight the importance of sectoral heterogeneity, intermediate goods, and sectoral linkages for the quantification of the welfare gains from tariffs reductions.",F.

The Dynamics of Comparative Advantage,"This paper characterizes the dynamic empirical properties of country export capabilities in order to inform modelling of the long-run behavior of comparative advantage.The starting point for our analysis is two strong empirical regularities in international trade that have previously been studied incompletely and in isolation to one another.The literature has noted a tendency for countries to concentrate exports in a few sectors.We show that this concentration arises from a heavy-tailed distribution of industry export capabilities that is approximately log normal and whose shape is stable across countries, sectors, and time.Likewise, previous research has detected a tendency for mean reversion in national industry productivities.We establish that mean reversion in export capability, rather than indicative of convergence in productivities or degeneracy in comparative advantage, is instead consistent with a well behaved stochastic growth process that delivers a stationary distribution of country export advantage.In literature on the growth of cities and firms, economists have used stochastic processes to study the determinants of the long-run size distributions.Our contribution is to develop an analogous empirical framework for identifying the parameters that govern the stationary distribution of export capability.The main result of this analysis is that a generalized gamma distribution, which nests many commonly studied distributions, provides a tight fit of the data but log normality offers a reasonable approximation.Importantly, the stochastic process that generates log normality can be estimated in its discretized form by simple linear regression.Log linearity allows for an extension of our approach to multivariate diffusions, in which one can permit innovations to productivity to be transmitted intersectorally and internationally, as in recent models of trade and growth.",Gordon Hanson; Marc-Andreas Muendler; Nelson Lind,,,,,,,,,,,,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w21753,"Dynamics (music), Computer science, Psychology, Pedagogy","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, San Diego","0519 University of California, San Diego 9500 Gilman Drive La Jolla, CA 92093-0519 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics, 0508 University of California, San Diego 9500 Gilman Drive La Jolla, CA 92093-0508; NBER ITI, Carnegie Mellon, UC Berkeley, Brown, Univ.

Gravity and Comparative Advantage: Estimation of Trade Elasticities for the Agricultural Sector,"In this paper, a structural gravity model is presented which features intra-sector heterogeneity in agricultural productivity systematically linked to land and climate characteristics.The ""systematic heterogeneity"" (SH) gravity model predicts that countries with similar land and climate characteristics tend to specialize in the same agricultural products.Agricultural trade flow elasticities then depend on comparative advantage, with larger-magnitude trade flow responses predicted among countries more likely to specialize in similar agricultural products and thus compete head-to-head in foreign markets.This is in contrast to standard log-linear gravity models, which impose a restrictive pattern of trade flow elasticities that depend only on absolute advantage in the agricultural sector.We also show how the SH gravity model can accommodate product-specific trade costs.This allows the model to analyze changes in the dispersion of trade costs across products.Such analysis cannot be carried out in a standard gravity model, in which trade costs are assumed constant.Our results confirm economically and statistically significant heterogeneity in the effects of the variables that typically proxy for trade costs in gravity models and demonstrate that the SH gravity model is able to overcome the limitations imposed by the restrictive pattern of elasticities in a standard gravity model.",Ian M.

The Dynamics of Firm Lobbying,"How is economic policy made? In this paper we study a key determinant of the answer to the question: lobbying by firms. Estimating a binary choice model of firm behavior, we find significant evidence for the idea that barriers to entry induce persistence in lobbying. The existence of these costs is further confirmed in studying how firms responded to a particular policy change: the expiration of legislation relating to the H-1B visa. Due to its influence on firm behavior, we argue that this persistence fundamentally changes the environment in which legislation is made. (JEL D22, D72, D78, L21)",Prachi Mishra; William F.

"Social Networks, Ethnicity, and Entrepreneurship","We study the relationship between ethnicity, occupational choice, and entrepreneurship.Immigrant groups in the United States cluster in specific business sectors.For example, Koreans are 34 times more concentrated in self-employment for dry cleaning than other immigrant groups, and Gujarati-speaking Indians are 84 times more concentrated in managing motels.We quantify that smaller and more socially isolated ethnic groups display higher rates of entrepreneurial concentration.This is consistent with a model of social interactions where nonwork relationships facilitate the acquisition of sector-specific skills and result in occupational stratification along ethnic lines via concentrated entrepreneurship.",Martin Mandorff; William Kerr,,,,,,,,,,,,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w21597,"Ethnic group, Entrepreneurship, Social entrepreneurship, Geography, Sociology, Economic geography, Political science, Anthropology, Law",National Bureau of Economic Research; Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center,"NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Swedish Competition Authority Konkurrensverket SE-103 85 Stockholm, Sweden; Harvard Business School Rock Center 212 Soldiers Field Boston, MA 02163","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Swedish Competition Authority Konkurrensverket SE-103 85 Stockholm, Sweden; Harvard Business School Rock Center 212 Soldiers Field Boston, MA 02163"
"Cutting the Innovation Engine: How Federal Funding Shocks Affect University Patenting, Entrepreneurship, and Publications","Abstract This article studies how federal funding affects the innovation outputs of university researchers. We link person-level research grants from 22 universities to patents, publications, and career outcomes from the U.S. Census Bureau. We focus on the effects of large, idiosyncratic, and temporary cuts to federal funding in a researcher’s preexisting narrow field of study. Using an event study design, we document that these negative federal funding shocks reduce high-tech entrepreneurship and publications but increase patenting. The lost publications tend to be higher quality and more basic, whereas the additional patents tend to be lower quality, less general, and more often privately assigned. These federal funding cuts lead to an increase in private funding, which partially compensates for the decline in federal funding. Together with evidence from industry-university contracts, the results suggest that federal funding cuts shift university research funding from federal to private sources and lead to innovation outputs that are less openly accessible and more often appropriated by corporate funders.",Alex Xi He; Elisabeth Ruth Perlman; Joseph Staudt; Sabrina T Howell; Tania Babina,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjac046,"Entrepreneurship, Quality (philosophy), Census, Federal funds, Business, Political science, Accounting, Economics, Finance, Sociology, Monetary policy, Monetary economics, Population, Philosophy, Demography, Epistemology","National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University; University of Maryland, College Park; United States Census Bureau","New York University and National Bureau of Economic Research , United States; University of Maryland , United States; U.S. Census Bureau , United States; Columbia University , United States","New York University and National Bureau of Economic Research , United States; University of Maryland , United States; U.S. Census Bureau , United States; Columbia University , United States"

It provides an expanded view of the world economy for 148 countries with chapters focusing on world view, people, environment, economy, states and markets, and global links as well as introductions highlighting recent research on major development issues. This edition includes some key indicators for 1999. This report aims to make statistics lively and comprehensive-to paint a picture of the world and its people. The numbers in this book tell the reader that people in most places are living longer, but that in countries gripped by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, life expectancies are declining. Average incomes continue to rise for most developing countries, but some of the poorest have slipped backwards, subjecting millions more to extreme poverty. It can also be seen that the developing countries are becoming more important participants in the global economy. But the picture is flawed because too often the data are incomplete or unreliable or entirely unavailable. Recognizing the many flaws in the statistical system and the need to address them directly by improving the capacity of countries to produce statistics, a consortium of more than 90 countries and international organizations has come together and pledged to increase the resources for statistical capacity building in developing countries. Hence future editions of this report may prove even more useful.

The Wandering Scholars: Understanding the Heterogeneity of University Commercialization,"University-based scientific research has long been argued to be a central source of commercial innovation and economic growth. Yet at the same time, there have been long-held concerns that many university-based discoveries never realize their potential social benefits. Looking across universities, research and commercialization activities such as start-up formation vary tremendously – variation that could reflect the composition and orientation of faculty research, university-level factors such as patenting and licensing efforts, or broader place-based factors such as location in a technology cluster. We take a first step towards unpacking this heterogeneity in university commercialization by analyzing how the propensity of academic research to spill over to commercial innovation changes when academics move across universities. Our estimates suggest that at least 15–25% of geographic variation in commercial spillovers from university-based research is attributable to place-specific factors.",Carolyn Stein; Heidi Williams; Henry Manley; Josh Lerner,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4694651,"Commercialization, Unpacking, Variation (astronomy), Economic geography, Regional science, Political science, Sociology, Marketing, Business, Geography, Linguistics, Philosophy, Physics, Astrophysics",Dartmouth Hospital; National Bureau of Economic Research; Entrepreneurial Ecosystems; Harvard University; Dartmouth College,National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Harvard Business School - Finance Unit; Independent; Harvard University - Entrepreneurial Management Unit; Dartmouth College,National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Harvard Business School - Finance Unit; Independent; Harvard University - Entrepreneurial Management Unit; Dartmouth College
Innovation and Human Capital Policy,"If innovation is to be subsidized, a natural place to start is to increase the quantity and quality of human capital.Innovation, after all, begins with people.Simply stimulating the ""demand side"" through R&D subsidies and tax breaks may only drive up the price, rather than the volume of research activity.By contrast, increasing the supply of potential inventors can both directly increase innovation and reduce its cost.This paper examines the evidence on human capital policies for stimulating innovation such as expanding the home-grown workforce, fostering immigration, boosting universities and reducing barriers to entry into inventor careers, especially for under-represented groups.The evidence suggests targeting high ability but disadvantaged potential inventors at an early age is likely to have the largest long-run effects on growth.",John Van Reenen,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w28713,"Human capital, Business, Industrial organization, Economics, Market economy",London School of Economics and Political Science; National Bureau of Economic Research,"NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics London School of Economics Houghton Street London, WC2A 2AE United Kingdom and NBER","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics London School of Economics Houghton Street London, WC2A 2AE United Kingdom and NBER"
Venture Capital’s Role in Financing Innovation: What We Know and How Much We Still Need to Learn,"Venture capital is associated with some of the most high-growth and influential firms in the world. Academics and practitioners have effectively articulated the strengths of the venture model. At the same time, venture capital financing also has real limitations in its ability to advance substantial technological change. Three issues are particularly concerning to us: 1) the very narrow band of technological innovations that fit the requirements of institutional venture capital investors; 2) the relatively small number of venture capital investors who hold and shape the direction of a substantial fraction of capital that is deployed into financing radical technological change; and 3) the relaxation in recent years of the intense emphasis on corporate governance by venture capital firms. While our ability to assess the social welfare impact of venture capital remains nascent, we hope that this article will stimulate discussion of and research into these questions.",Josh Lerner; Ramana Nanda,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.34.3.237,"Venture capital, Social venture capital, Business, Corporate governance, Capital (architecture), Finance, Financial capital, Individual capital, Welfare, Economics, Market economy, Human capital, Archaeology, History",National Bureau of Economic Research,"Ramana Nanda is Sarofim-Rock Professor, both at Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts.

Digital Entrepreneurship in Finance: Fintechs and Funding Decision Criteria,"After the 2007–08 global financial crisis, research flourished on entrepreneurship through digital innovation in the financial market as well as on investors’ influence on digital technology-based entrepreneurs’ funding decisions. This study combines these two research streams to analyze the decision-making criteria for funding financial technology companies (fintechs), hybrid companies that combine digital entrepreneurship, technology, and banking. The study first uses prior literature to derive important characteristics to define fintechs and then uses 12 expert interviews to elaborate on decision-making criteria in funding. Except for smaller peculiarities, fintech funding does not appear to differ from that of other digital entrepreneurship in different markets, and—as with most digital business models—scalability was identified as a key criterion. Additionally, by serving as a major provider of money for young companies, banks have changed their role and positioning in funding new financial technology entrepreneurs. Through developments in digital technology, banks have shifted from traditional money-lending activities (i.e., debt-financing) to becoming stakeholders in fintechs and, hence, equity investors. We also describe how these formerly distinct fields have converged due to regulatory requirements, digital newcomers, and a need for constant innovation, with their future sustainable development dependent on sharing and collaboration.",Kristin Hommel; Peter M.

Donating the Voucher: An Alternative Tax Treatment of Private School Enrollment,"Approximately 10% of school-age children in the United States are enrolled in private schools, relieving the financial burden on public school systems, and the taxpayers who support them, of the cost of their education. At present, the tax code does not allow families who provide this financial relief an income tax deduction, even though such relief is a gift to governments for exclusively public purposes and thus is analogous to a charitable donation. Using the Public Use Microdata Sample of the American Community Survey and the NBER Internet Taxsim calculator, this paper estimates that granting families who enroll their children in private schools an income tax deduction equal to the per-pupil expenditures in their public school district would cost the federal government an average of $7.75 billion per year over the 2006–10 period. This amount is less than 1% of federal income tax revenues. Because private school enrollment, public school expenditures, the likelihood of itemization, and marginal tax rates increase with taxpayer income, the dollar benefits of this change are positively related to income. At the margin, high-income taxpayers would receive about 35 cents in federal and state tax relief for each dollar of per-pupil expenditures forgone.",Andrew A.

Aggregate Advertising Expenditure in the U.S. Economy: What's Up? Is It Real?,"The two components of the advertising industry -the creative sector that develops and produces messages, and the communications sector that transmits messages via various media -have each been greatly affected by advances in creative design and communications technologies.As the media composition of advertising has changed in the last century for both local and national advertising -from newspapers, outdoor and radio advertising to network and cable television, and most recently to internet and digital media -so too has been transformed the very concept of advertising, its functionality and its measurement.We compare four sources of annual nominal U.S. aggregate advertising expenditure data -from the public sector Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Census Bureau Survey of Service Industries, and the private sector McCann Erickson and Magna Global advertising agencies-that are available over various time periods.In nominal terms, we estimate the elasticity of advertising expenditures with respect to Gross Domestic Product, and find that this elasticity appears to have increased substantially beginning in the late 1990s -from about 1.4 to 1.9.The timing of this structural break coincides roughly with the decline of print, radio and network and cable television, and the dramatic increase in digital and internet-based advertising.To understand the forces underlying this structural break in nominal advertising expenditures, data on media-specific advertising prices are needed, thereby converting nominal to real advertising.However, currently annual U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Index data on digital and many other advertising media prices are only available beginning in 2010.The availability of media-specific quality-constant price indexes would not only enable researchers to trace more completely the recent impact of digital and internet advertising, but would also facilitate contemporary and longstanding issues to be addressed surrounding the measurement of advertising effects, including how variations in the durability of response to advertising across media are related to inter-media price differentials, and why heterogeneity among firms and industries may arise with respect to the procyclicality of advertising policies.",Alvin J.

Work from Home and Interstate Migration,"Interstate migration by working-age adults in the US declined substantially during the Great Recession and remained subdued through 2019.We document that interstate migration rose sharply following the 2020 Covid-19 outbreak, nearly recovering to pre-Great recession levels, and provide evidence that this reversal was primarily driven by the rise in work from home (WFH).Before the pandemic, interstate migration by WFH workers was consistently 50% higher than for commuters.Since the Covid-19 outbreak, this migration gap persisted while the WFH share tripled.Using quasi-panel data and plausibly exogenous changes in employer WFH policies, we address concerns about omitted variables or reverse causality and conclude that access to WFH induces greater interstate migration.An aggregate accounting exercise suggests that over half of the rise in interstate migration since 2019 can be accounted for by the rise in the WFH share.Moreover, both actual WFH and pre-pandemic WFH potential, based on occupation shares, can account for a sizable share of cross-state variation in migration.",Adam Blandin; Alexander Bick; Hannah Rubinton; Karel Mertens,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.20955/wp.2024.012,"Work (physics), Geography, Engineering, Mechanical engineering",Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas; Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; Vanderbilt University,Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis & CEPR; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas & CEPR; Vanderbilt University,Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis & CEPR; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas & CEPR; Vanderbilt University
UNDERSTANDING THE LONG‐RUN DECLINE IN INTERSTATE MIGRATION,"We analyze the secular decline in gross interstate migration in the United States from 1991 to 2011. We argue that migration fell because of a decline in the geographic specificity of returns to occupations, together with an increase in workers' ability to learn about other locations before moving. Micro data on earnings and occupations across space provide evidence for lower geographic specificity. Other explanations do not fit the data. A calibrated model formalizes the geographic specificity and information mechanisms and is consistent with cross‐sectional and time‐series evidence. Our mechanisms can explain at least half of the decline in migration.",Greg Kaplan; Sam Schulhofer‐Wohl,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/iere.12209,"Fell, Earnings, Economics, Demographic economics, Secular variation, Geography, Economic geography, Econometrics, Demography, Finance, Sociology, Cartography",Federal Reserve; Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago; University of Chicago; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis,"University of Chicago and NBER, U.S.A.; We thank Diego Amador, Chloe Booth, and Yoon Sun Hur for excellent research assistance and Joan Gieseke for editorial assistance.

Health Effects of Economic Crises,"Abstract This analysis summarizes prior research and uses national, US state and county‐level data from 1976 to 2013 to examine whether the mortality effects of economic crises differ in kind from those of the more typical fluctuations. The tentative conclusion is that economic crises affect mortality rates (and presumably other measures of health) in the same way as less severe downturns – leading to improvements in physical health. The effects of severe national recessions in the USA appear to have a beneficial effect on mortality that is roughly twice as strong as that predicted by the elevated unemployment rates alone, while the higher predicted rate of suicides during typical periods of economic weakness is approximately offset during severe recessions. No consistent pattern is obtained for more localized economic crises occurring at the state level – some estimates suggest larger protective mortality effects while others indicate offsetting deleterious consequences.

Continuity or change? How the onset of COVID‐19 affected internal migration in Australia,"Despite anecdotal evidence of a COVID-19 induced decline in the intensity of interstate migration in Australia, population-level evidence is limited. The recent release of the 2020 wave of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey provides a unique opportunity to robustly assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the level, direction, determinants, and reasons for migration in Australia. By applying a series of regression models to individual-level longitudinal microdata, and measuring migration at a range of spatial scales, this paper shows that COVID-19 has somewhat accelerated the long-term decline in the intensity of internal migration-particularly for residential mobility, short-distance migration, and migration due to employment and involuntary reasons. The socio-demographic determinants of migration have remained broadly stable, despite a slight increase in the deterring effect of duration of residence and a reduction in the impact of education. Finally, we show that the increase in net migration gains in regional areas is underpinned by a decrease in outflows. Juxtaposing these results with aggregate-level migration statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics from 2021, we conclude that the effect of COVID-19 on internal migration to date has been minimal and is likely to be short-lived. However, it may still be too soon to make a definitive judgement, as shifts in work patterns stemming from the pandemic may further transform the level, direction, and composition of internal migration.",Aude Bernard; Francisco Perales,,,,,,,,,,,,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.2626,"Internal migration, Microdata (statistics), Demographic economics, Net migration rate, Residence, Geography, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Pandemic, Population, Demography, Economic geography, Economics, Population growth, Sociology, Medicine, Disease, Pathology, Infectious disease (medical specialty), Census",The University of Queensland,"School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia; School of Social Science, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia","School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia; School of Social Science, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
The Transformation of Manufacturing and the Decline in U.S. Employment,"Using data from a variety of sources, this paper comprehensively documents the dramatic changes in the manufacturing sector and the large decline in employment rates and hours worked among prime-aged Americans since 2000.We use cross-region variation to explore the link between declining manufacturing employment and labor market outcomes.We find that manufacturing decline in a local area in the 2000s had large and persistent negative effects on local employment rates, hours worked and wages.We also show that declining local manufacturing employment is related to rising local opioid use and deaths.These results suggest that some of the recent opioid epidemic is driven by demand factors in addition to increased opioid supply.We conclude the paper with a discussion of potential mediating factors associated with declining manufacturing labor demand including public and private transfer receipt, sectoral switching, and inter-region mobility.Overall, we conclude that the decline in manufacturing employment was a substantial cause of the decline in employment rates during the 2000s particularly for less educated prime age workers.Given the trends in both capital and skill deepening within this sector, we further conclude that many policies currently being discussed to promote the manufacturing sector will have only a modest labor market impact for less educated individuals.",Erik Hurst; Kerwin Kofi Charles; Mariel Schwartz,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w24468,"Transformation (genetics), Economics, Labour economics, Operations management, Biology, Biochemistry, Gene",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago,"School of Business University of Chicago Harper Center Chicago, IL 60637; Harris School of Public Policy University of Chicago 1155 East 60th Street Chicago, IL 60637 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of Chicago 5757 S.

Why Do Wages Grow Faster for Educated Workers?,"The U.S. college wage premium doubles over the life cycle, from 27 percent at age 25 to 60 percent at age 55.Using a panel survey of workers followed through age 60, I show that growth in the college wage premium is primarily explained by occupational sorting.Shortly after graduating, workers with college degrees shift into professional, nonroutine occupations with much greater returns to tenure.Nearly 90 percent of life cycle wage growth occurs within rather than between jobs.To understand these patterns, I develop a model of human capital investment where workers differ in learning ability and jobs vary in complexity.Faster learners complete more education and sort into complex jobs with greater returns to investment.College acts as a gateway to professional occupations, which offer more opportunity for wage growth through onthe-job learning.",David Deming,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w31373,"Labour economics, Demographic economics, Business, Economics",National Bureau of Economic Research; Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center; John F.

The Distinct Effects of Information Technology and Communication Technology on Firm Organization,"Guided by theories of “management by exception,” we study the impact of information and communication technology on worker and plant manager autonomy and span of control. The theory suggests that information technology is a decentralizing force, whereas communication technology is a centralizing force. Using a new data set of American and European manufacturing firms, we find indeed that better information technologies (enterprise resource planning (ERP) for plant managers and computer-assisted design/computer-assisted manufacturing for production workers) are associated with more autonomy and a wider span of control, whereas technologies that improve communication (like data intranets) decrease autonomy for workers and plant managers. Using instrumental variables (distance from ERP’s place of origin and heterogeneous telecommunication costs arising from regulation) strengthens our results.

Who Lives in the C-Suite? Organizational Structure and the Division of Labor in Top Management,"Top management structures in large U.S. firms have changed significantly since the mid-1980s. The size of the executive team—the group of managers reporting directly to the CEO—doubled during this period. This growth was driven primarily by an increase in functional managers rather than general managers, a phenomenon we term “functional centralization.” Using panel data on senior management positions, we show that changes in the structure of the executive team are tightly linked to changes in firm diversification and information technology investments. These relationships depend crucially on the function involved; those closer to the product (“product” functions, e.g., marketing and R&amp;D) behave differently from functions further from the product (“administrative” functions, e.g., finance, law, and human resources). We argue that this distinction is driven by differences in the information-processing activities associated with each function and apply this insight to refine and extend existing theories of centralization. We also discuss the implications of our results for organizational forms beyond the executive team.

How Rules and Compliance Impact Organizational Outcomes: Evidence from Delegation in Environmental Regulation,"Formal rules within organizations are pervasive, but may be interpreted and implemented differently by actors within the organization, impacting organizational outcomes.We consider a delegation reform that changed formal rules within the environmental regulator in an Indian state, by giving decision rights to junior officers over certain types of application.Using novel data on firms' environmental permit applications and internal communications within the regulator, we study how the delegation of formal authority affects its actual allocation, the consequences for applicant firms, and the circumstances that lead senior officers to withhold this authority.The change in decision rights led to greater approval rates for applicant firms.However, only two thirds of applications that should have been delegated according to the rules were actually delegated.We show that senior officers chose to retain decision rights over more difficult applications, namely, applications with higher pollution potential.Furthermore, baseline disagreement with more subordinates' recommendations reduces delegation post-reform, and officers facing a higher backlog of applications are more likely to delegate.These results are consistent with a framework where the allocation of decision rights is determined by a knowledge hierarchy and where different senior officers face varying costs of delegation at different times.",James Fenske; Muhammad Haseeb; Namrata Kala,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w31991,"Delegation, Compliance (psychology), Environmental compliance, Business, Environmental regulation, Environmental impact assessment, Rules of evidence, Environmental resource management, Psychology, Public economics, Political science, Social psychology, Economics, Law",University of Göttingen; Stanford University; University of Bristol; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Warwick; University of Manchester; Deakin University,"Aix-Marseille School of Economics, Deakin University,; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of Warwick Gibbet Hill Road Coventry, CV4 7AL United Kingdom; University of Gottingen, the University of Manchester, and the University of Warwick; Priory Road Complex University of Bristol United Kingdom; MIT, NBER, Northwestern University, Stanford University, the University of Bristol, the; MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main Street, E62-517 Cambridge, MA 02142","Aix-Marseille School of Economics, Deakin University,; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of Warwick Gibbet Hill Road Coventry, CV4 7AL United Kingdom; University of Gottingen, the University of Manchester, and the University of Warwick; Priory Road Complex University of Bristol United Kingdom; MIT, NBER, Northwestern University, Stanford University, the University of Bristol, the; MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main Street, E62-517 Cambridge, MA 02142"
Advanced Technologies Adoption and Use by U.S. Firms: Evidence from the Annual Business Survey,"We introduce a new survey module intended to complement and expand research on the causes and consequences of advanced technology adoption.The 2018 Annual Business Survey (ABS), conducted by the Census Bureau in partnership with the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES), provides comprehensive and timely information on the diffusion among U.S. firms of advanced technologies including artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, robotics, and the digitization of business information.The 2018 ABS is a large, nationally representative sample of over 850,000 firms covering all private, nonfarm sectors of the economy.We describe the motivation for and development of the technology module in the ABS, as well as provide a first look at technology adoption and use patterns across firms and sectors.We find that digitization is quite widespread, as is some use of cloud computing.In contrast, advanced technology adoption is rare and generally skewed towards larger and older firms.Adoption patterns are consistent with a hierarchy of increasing technological sophistication, in which most firms that adopt AI or other advanced business technologies also use the other, more widely diffused technologies.Finally, while few firms are at the technology frontier, they tend to be large so technology exposure of the average worker is significantly higher.",Cathy Buffington; David Beede; David N.

Production Chain Organization in the Digital Age: Information Technology Use and Vertical Integration in U.S. Manufacturing,"Advances in information technology (IT) may affect the organizational design of production. Exploiting the rapid diffusion of the internet in the United States, we assess the sensitivity of production chain organization to this innovation in IT access and use. Extending theories of the firm that recognize the importance of downstream transfers (selling as opposed to sourcing) and plural governance in organizational design, we predict IT-driven shifts in downstream vertical integration. In a detailed panel of Census Bureau data for over 5,600 manufacturing plants, we observe the extent of a production unit’s downstream transactions within the firm alongside concurrent sales to external customers—a mix we refer to as plural selling. Our main finding is that the use of the internet for external coordination precipitated a significant decline in downstream vertical integration across the manufacturing sector. Instrumental variables estimation points to a causal relationship but also heterogeneous treatment effects. Key drivers of plural organization, such as complementarities and constraints across differently governed transactions, help explain such heterogeneity, as does concurrent use of internal production management IT. Our study is the first study to leverage a plural governance framework and large-scale microdata to understand how U.S. production chain organization shifted in response to this rapid and far-reaching technological change.

The Slow Growth of New Plants: Learning about Demand?,"It is well known that new businesses are typically much smaller than their established industry competitors, and that this size gap closes slowly. We show that even in commodity-like product markets, these patterns do not reflect productivity gaps, but rather show differences in demand-side fundamentals. We document and explore patterns in plants’ idiosyncratic demand levels by estimating a dynamic model of plant expansion in the presence of a demand accumulation process (e.g. building a customer base). We find that active accumulation driven by plants’ past production decisions quantitatively dominates passive demand accumulation, and that within-firm spillovers affect demand levels but not growth.",Chad Syverson; John Haltiwanger; Lucia Foster,,,,,,,,,,,,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/ecca.12172,"Competitor analysis, Commodity, Productivity, Industrial organization, Economics, Customer base, Production (economics), Product (mathematics), Imitation, Consumer demand, On demand, Microeconomics, Commerce, Market economy, Macroeconomics, Biology, Geometry, Mathematics, Management, Finance, Neuroscience",United States Census Bureau; University of Chicago,University of Maryland and NBER; University of Chicago Booth School of Business and NBER; Bureau of the Census,University of Maryland and NBER; University of Chicago Booth School of Business and NBER; Bureau of the Census
Misallocation Measures: The Distortion That Ate the Residual,"A large literature on misallocation and productivity has arisen in recent years, with Hsieh and Klenow (2009; hereafter HK) as its standard empirical framework.The framework's usefulness and theoretical founding make it a valuable starting point for analyzing misallocations.However, we show this approach is sensitive to model misspecification.The model's mapping from observed production behaviors to misallocative wedges/distortions holds in a single theoretical case, with strict assumptions required on both the demand and supply sides.We demonstrate that applying the HK methodology when there is any deviation from these assumptions will mean ""distortions"" recovered from the data may not be signs of inefficiency.Rather, they may simply reflect demand shifts or movements of the firm along its marginal cost curve, quite possibly in profitable directions.The framework may then not just spuriously identify inefficiencies; it might be more likely to do so precisely for businesses better in some fundamental way than their competitors.Empirical tests in our data, which allow us to separate price and quantity and as such directly test the model's assumptions, suggest the framework's necessary conditions do not hold.We then extend the HK framework to allow for more general demand and supply structures to quantify the discrepancy between the framework and the data.We find substantial deviations, particularly on the demand side.Using a decomposition derived from our extended framework, we find that much of the variation in revenue-based TFP (the measure of distortions in HK) reflects the influence of demand shifts, either directly or through distortions correlated with those shifts.We furthermore show that under general conditions, the variance of revenue-based TFP is not a sufficient statistic for efficiency losses due to misallocation.",Chad Syverson; John Haltiwanger; Robert B.

Macro and Micro Dynamics of Productivity: From Devilish Details to Insights,"Firm-level, revenue-based productivity measures are ubiquitous in studies of firm dynamics and aggregate outcomes. One common measure is increasingly interpreted as reflecting “distortions” since in distortions’ absence, equalization of marginal revenue products should yield no dispersion in this measure. Another common but distinct measure is the residual of the firm-level revenue function, which reflects “fundamentals.” Using micro-level US manufacturing data, we find these alternative measures are highly correlated, exhibit similar dispersion, and have similar relationships with growth and survival. However, the distinction between these alternative measures is critically important for quantitative assessment of the level and decline of allocative efficiency.

Measuring Cross-Country Differences in Misallocation,"In this paper, we discuss the role that data processing and collection have for the measurement of misallocation. First, we turn to the raw self-reported data for the US, reflecting what can be found in most developing countries. In the raw data, measured misallocation (following Hsieh and Klenow 2009) is substantially higher than for any other country for which we have census data. For instance, if Indian firms had the same dispersion of distortions as measured in the reported US data, TFP in the Indian manufacturing sector would decrease by around 2/3. Second, we follow a different strategy for editing and imputing missing data than what is used by the US Census Bureau, by using a method that seeks to replicate the true variance in the underlying data generating process known as Classification and Regression Trees (CART). This change raises the potential gains from removing misallocation in the United States manufacturing sector by around 10%.",Amil Petrin; Martin Rotemberg; Mitsukuni Nishida; T. Kirk White; T.

Simultaneous edit-imputation and disclosure limitation for business establishment data,"Business establishment microdata typically are required to satisfy agency-specified edit rules, such as balance equations and linear inequalities. Inevitably some establishments' reported data violate the edit rules. Statistical agencies correct faulty values using a process known as edit-imputation. Business establishment data also must be heavily redacted before being shared with the public; indeed, confidentiality concerns lead many agencies not to share establishment microdata as unrestricted access files. When microdata must be heavily redacted, one approach is to create synthetic data, as done in the U.S. Longitudinal Business Database and the German IAB Establishment Panel. This article presents the first implementation of a fully integrated approach to edit-imputation and data synthesis. We illustrate the approach on data from the U.S. Census of Manufactures and present a variety of evaluations of the utility of the synthetic data. The paper also presents assessments of disclosure risks for several intruder attacks. We find that the synthetic data preserve important distributional features from the post-editing confidential microdata, and have low risks for the various attacks.",Alan F. Karr; Hang J.

Measuring Productivity Dispersion,"Measuring the dispersion of productivity or efficiency across firms in a market or industry is rife with methodological issues. Nevertheless, the existence of considerable dispersion now is well documented and widely accepted. Less well understood are the economic features and mechanisms underlying the magnitude of dispersion and how dispersion varies over time or across markets. On the one hand, selection mechanisms in both output and input markets should favor the most productive units through resource reallocation, thereby reducing dispersion. On the other hand, innovation and technological uncertainty tend to increase dispersion. This chapter presents a guide to measurement of dispersion and provides empirical evidence from a selection of countries and industries using a variety of methodologies.",Eric J.

Watching the grass grow: does recreational cannabis legalization affect retail and agricultural wages?,"Over the past several years, cannabis has become legal for recreational use in many US states and jurisdictions around the world. The opening of these markets has led to the establishment of hundreds of cannabis production and retail firms with accompanying demand for labor, leading to concerns about spillover effects on wages from incumbents.We study the markets for agricultural and retail labor in Washington and Colorado from 2000 to 2019 using differences-in-differences with synthetic controls. We employ employment data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, state-level demographic data from the US Census Bureau, and agricultural data from the National Agricultural Statistics Service. We use the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for variable selection and classification and regression trees (CART) for chained imputation of missing values.We find little-to-no evidence of a significant difference in weekly wages per worker generated by cannabis legalization: the log of the weekly wage per worker decreases by 0.013 in Washington's agricultural sector (p value 0.091) and increases by 0.059 in Washington's retail sector (p value 0.606). Results in Colorado are qualitatively similar. These results are limited in part by the short post-legalization period of the data.Cannabis legalization is unlikely to negatively impact incumbent agriculture or retail firms through the labor market channel.",Keaton Miller; Sichao Jiang,,,,,,,,,,,,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s42238-022-00149-6,"Legalization, Wage, Agriculture, Economics, Survey data collection, Demographic economics, Labour economics, Business, Geography, Political science, Statistics, Mathematics, Archaeology, Law",University of Oregon,"Department of Economics, University of Oregon, Eugene, USA","Department of Economics, University of Oregon, Eugene, USA"

Untangling Trade and Technology: Evidence from Local Labour Markets,"We juxtapose the effects of trade and technology on employment in US local labour markets between 1980 and 2007. Labour markets whose initial industry composition exposes them to rising Chinese import competition experience significant falls in employment, particularly in manufacturing and among non‐college workers. Labour markets susceptible to computerisation due to specialisation in routine task‐intensive activities instead experience occupational polarisation within manufacturing and non‐manufacturing but do not experience a net employment decline. Trade impacts rise in the 2000s as imports accelerate, while the effect of technology appears to shift from automation of production activities in manufacturing towards computerisation of information‐processing tasks in non‐manufacturing.",David Autor; David Dorn; David H.

A Toolkit of Policies to Promote Innovation,"Economic theory suggests that market economies are likely to underprovide innovation because of the public good nature of knowledge. Empirical evidence from the United States and other advanced economies supports this idea. We summarize the pros and cons of different policy instruments for promoting innovation and provide a basic “toolkit” describing which policies are most effective according to our reading of the evidence. In the short run, R&amp;D tax credits and direct public funding seem the most productive, but in the longer run, increasing the supply of human capital (for example, relaxing immigration rules or expanding university STEM admissions) is likely more effective.",Heidi Williams; John Van Reenen; Nicholas Bloom,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.33.3.163,"Human capital, Economics, Reading (process), Immigration, Empirical evidence, Public economics, Public policy, Capital (architecture), Tax policy, Market economy, Economic growth, Tax reform, Political science, Philosophy, Archaeology, Epistemology, Law, History",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Professor of Economics, Stanford University, Stanford, California.; Heidi Williams is Professor of Economics, Stanford University, Stanford, California.

Importing Political Polarization? The Electoral Consequences of Rising Trade Exposure,"Has rising import competition contributed to the polarization of US politics? Analyzing multiple measures of political expression and results of congressional and presidential elections spanning the period 2000 through 2016, we find strong though not definitive evidence of an ideological realignment in trade-exposed local labor markets that commences prior to the divisive 2016 US presidential election. Exploiting the exogenous component of rising import competition by China, we find that trade exposed electoral districts simultaneously exhibit growing ideological polarization in some domains, meaning expanding support for both strong-left and strong-right views, and pure rightward shifts in others. Specifically, trade-impacted commuting zones or districts saw an increasing market share for the Fox News channel (a rightward shift), stronger ideological polarization in campaign contributions (a polarized shift), and a relative rise in the likelihood of electing a Republican to Congress (a rightward shift). Trade-exposed counties with an initial majority White population became more likely to elect a GOP conservative, while trade-exposed counties with an initial majority-minority population became more likely to elect a liberal Democrat, where in both sets of counties, these gains came at the expense of moderate Democrats (a polarized shift). In presidential elections, counties with greater trade exposure shifted toward the Republican candidate (a rightward shift). These results broadly support an emerging political economy literature that connects adverse economic shocks to sharp ideological realignments that cleave along racial and ethnic lines and induce discrete shifts in political preferences and economic policy.

Understanding China's Urban Pollution Dynamics,"China's ongoing urban economic growth has sharply increased the population's per capita income, lowered the count of people living below the poverty line, and caused major environmental problems. We survey the growing literature investigating the causes and consequences of China's urban pollution challenges. We begin by studying how urban population and industrial growth impacts local pollution levels and greenhouse gas production. As the urban population grows richer, its demand for private transportation and electricity sharply increases. Such privately beneficial activity exacerbates urban pollution externalities. Facing these severe environmental challenges, China's urbanites increasingly demand quality of life progress. We survey the emerging literature investigating the demand for environmental progress in China. Progress in mitigating externalities hinges on whether the powerful central and local governments choose to address these issues. We analyze the political economy of whether government officials have strong incentives to tackle lingering urban externalities. We conclude by discussing future research opportunities at the intersection of environmental and urban economics. (JEL O18, P25, P28, Q53, R23, R41, R58)",Matthew E Kahn; Matthew E.

General Equilibrium Effects in Space: Theory and Measurement,"How do international trade shocks affect spatially connected regional markets?We answer this question by extending shift-share empirical specifications to incorporate general equilibrium effects that arise in spatial models.In partial equilibrium, regional shock exposure has a shiftshare structure: it is the average shock weighted by regional exposure shares in revenue and consumption.General equilibrium responses of employment and wages in each market are the sum, across all regions, of these shift-share measures times bilateral reduced-form elasticities determined by the economy's spatial links.We use this reduced-form representation of the model to efficiently estimate the bilateral elasticities exploiting exogenous variation in shock exposure across markets.Finally, we study the general equilibrium impact of the ""China shock"" on U.S. CZs using our model-consistent generalization of the specification in Autor et al. (2013).We find that indirect effects from the shock exposure of other markets reinforce the negative impact of the market's own shock exposure, leading to employment and wage losses that are significantly larger than those reported in the existing literature.",Costas Arkolakis; Federico Esposito; Rodrigo Adão,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w25544,"Space (punctuation), Mathematical economics, Statistical physics, General equilibrium theory, Theoretical physics, Physics, Mathematics, Computer science, Economics, Microeconomics, Operating system",Tufts University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago; Yale University,"Department of Economics Yale University, 28 Hillhouse Avenue P.O.

"Spatial Linkages, Global Shocks, and Local Labor Markets: Theory and Evidence","How do shocks to economic fundamentals in the world economy affect local labor markets? In a framework with a flexible structure of spatial linkages, we characterize the model-consistent shock exposure of a local market as the exogenous shift in its production revenues and consumption costs. In general equilibrium, labor outcomes in any market respond directly to the market's own shock exposure, and indirectly to other markets shocks exposures. We show how spatial linkages control the size and the heterogeneity of these indirect effects. We then develop a new estimation methodology — the Model-implied Optimal IV (MOIV) — that exploits quasi-experimental variation in economic shocks to estimate spatial linkages and evaluate their counterfactual implications. Applying our methodology to US Commuting Zones, we find that difference-in-difference designs based on model-consistent measures of local shock exposure approximate well the differential effect of international trade shocks across CZs, but miss around half of the aggregate effect, partly due to the offsetting action of indirect effects.",Costas Arkolakis; Federico Esposito; Rodrigo Adao; Rodrigo Adão,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3332087,"Spatial mismatch, Economics, Economic geography, Labour economics",Tufts University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago; Yale University,University of Chicago - Booth School of Business; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Yale University - Department of Economics; Tufts University - Department of Economics; Yale University - Cowles Foundation,University of Chicago - Booth School of Business; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Yale University - Department of Economics; Tufts University - Department of Economics; Yale University - Cowles Foundation
The Local Economic and Welfare Consequences of Hydraulic Fracturing,"Exploiting geological variation and timing in the initiation of hydraulic fracturing, we find that fracking leads to sharp increases in oil and gas recovery and improvements in a wide set of economic indicators. There is also evidence of deterioration in local amenities, which may include increases in crime, noise, and traffic and declines in health. Using a Rosen-Roback-style spatial equilibrium model to infer the net welfare impacts, we estimate that willingness-to-pay (WTP) for allowing fracking equals about $2,500 per household annually (4.9 percent of household income), although WTP is heterogeneous, ranging from more than $10,000 to roughly 0 across 10 shale regions.(JEL D12, K42, L71, Q35, Q51, Q53, R41)",Alexander Bartik; Alexander W.

Nudging Farmers to Use Fertilizer: Theory and Experimental Evidence from Kenya,"We model farmers as facing small fixed costs of purchasing fertilizer and assume some are stochastically present biased and not fully sophisticated about this bias. Such farmers may procrastinate, postponing fertilizer purchases until later periods, when they may be too impatient to purchase fertilizer. Consistent with the model, many farmers in Western Kenya fail to take advantage of apparently profitable fertilizer investments, but they do invest in response to small, time-limited discounts on the cost of acquiring fertilizer (free delivery) just after harvest. Calibration suggests that this policy can yield higher welfare than either laissez-faire policies or heavy subsidies.

Misfortune and Mistake: The Financial Conditions and Decision-making Ability of High-cost Loan Borrowers,"The appropriateness of many high-cost loan regulations depends on whether demand is driven by financial conditions (""misfortunes"") or imperfect decisions (""mistakes"").Bank records from Iceland show borrowers have especially low liquidity just before getting a loan, but their spending is not especially low in the days before the loan arrives and some spend a substantial fraction of the loans on seemingly inessential items.Borrowers exhibit lower decision-making ability (DMA) in linked choice experiments: 45%of loan dollars go to the bottom 20% of the DMA distribution.Standard determinants of demand do not explain this relationship, which is also mirrored by the relationship between DMA and an unambiguous ""mistake.""Both ""misfortune"" and ""mistake"" thus appear to drive demand.",Arna Olafsson; Dan Silverman; Leandro Carvalho,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w26328,"Mistake, Misfortune, Loan, Business, Actuarial science, Finance, Economics, Computer science, Law, Political science, Artificial intelligence, Perspective (graphical)",Copenhagen Business School; National Bureau of Economic Research; Arizona State University; University of Southern California,"Department of Economics W.P.

Unbanked and impoverished? Exploring banking and poverty interactions over time,"Abstract In 2019, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) reported that 7.1 million households in the United States (5.4%) were unbanked and lacked a checking or savings account). Using three leading household surveys, this paper documents how the interaction between bank access and poverty has evolved over time. We present a historical time series of unbanked rates, showing high‐unbanked rates for those in poverty even with increases in financial access over time. In the 1980s, 49.6% of households in poverty were unbanked while 22.8% were unbanked in 2019. Unbanked rates were even higher for Black and Hispanic households that were in poverty. In the 1980s, these groups had unbanked rates of 73.6% and 66.5% which declined to 38.4% and 31.8% in 2019, respectively. To explain differences in banking rates by race, we use binary Kitagawa‐Oaxaca‐Blinder decompositions. Socio‐demographic characteristics explain less than half the difference in unbanked rates for Blacks and around half for Hispanics.",John Creamer; Lewis Warren,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/joca.12576,"Unbanked, Poverty, Business, Economics, Economic growth, Financial inclusion, Financial services, Finance",United States Census Bureau,"Social, Economic, and Housing Statistics Division, U.S. Census Bureau, Suitland, Maryland, USA","Social, Economic, and Housing Statistics Division, U.S. Census Bureau, Suitland, Maryland, USA"

The distribution of income is worse than you think: Including pollution impacts into measures of income inequality,"This paper calculates the distribution of an adjusted measure of income that deducts damages due to exposure to air pollution from reported market income in the United States from 2011 to 2014. The Gini coefficient for this measure of adjusted income is 0.682 in 2011, as compared to 0.482 for market income. By 2014, we estimate that the Gini for adjusted income fell to 0.646, while the market income Gini did not appreciably change. The inclusion of air pollution damage acts like a regressive tax: with air pollution, the bottom 20% of households lose roughly 10% of the share of income, while the top 20% of households gain 10%. We find that, unlike the case for market income, New England is not the most unequal division with respect to adjusted income. Further, the difference between adjusted income for white and Hispanics is smaller than expected. However, the gap in augmented income between whites and African-Americans is widening.",Nicholas Z.

How Exporters Grow,"We show that in successful episodes of export market entry, there are statistically and economically significant post-entry dynamics of quantities, but no post-entry dynamics of markups.This suggests that shifts in demand play an important role in successful entry, but that firms do not use dynamic manipulation of markups as an instrument to shift demand.We structurally estimate two competing models of customer base accumulation to match these moments.In the first model, firms use marketing and advertising to acquire new customers and thereby shift demand and increase sales.In the second, they use temporarily low markups to do so.The marketing and advertising model fits the quantity and markup moments well, and implies that successful entry is associated with high selling expenses.The second model cannot simultaneously fit quantity and markup moments, even with a counterfactually high price elasticity of demand and trade elasticity.We conclude that successful market entry is more likely to be associated with high selling expenses than low markups.",Doireann Fitzgerald; Stefanie Haller; Yaniv Yedid-Levi; Yaniv Yedid‐Levi,,,,,,,,,,,,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w21935,"Markup language, Price elasticity of demand, Elasticity (physics), Microeconomics, Industrial organization, Economics, Customer base, Business, Econometrics, Marketing, Computer science, Materials science, XML, Composite material, Operating system",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of British Columbia; University College Dublin; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis,"University College Dublin School of Economics Belfield Dublin; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; University of British Columbia; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis 90 Hennepin Ave Minneapolis, MN 55401; Ireland","University College Dublin School of Economics Belfield Dublin; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; University of British Columbia; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis 90 Hennepin Ave Minneapolis, MN 55401; Ireland"

FDI and the Task Content of Domestic Employment for U.S. Multinationals,"Using a unique dataset, we examine how the foreign direct investment activities of U.S. multinational manufacturers are related to the composition of their domestic employment.The analysis is based on a dataset in which Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) firm-level data on the foreign operations of U.S. multinationals are matched with Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) establishment-level data on occupation and wage distributions.The main implication of our findings is that foreign direct investment is generally positively correlated with domestic labor demand, with automated/routine tasks representing an important exception.For firms that export a significant amount to their foreign affiliates for further processing, foreign labor in low-income countries appears to substitute for domestic labor in automated/routine tasks.Our results show that these firms tend to be younger and smaller.They do not seem to be more engaged in innovative activity at home compared to other multinational manufacturers in our sample.",Alexis Grimm; Mina Kim,,,,,,,,,,,,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.24149/gwp286,"Multinational corporation, Foreign direct investment, Business, Sample (material), Labour economics, Investment (military), Wage, Demographic economics, International trade, Economics, Political science, Finance, Macroeconomics, Chemistry, Chromatography, Politics, Law",Bureau of Economic Analysis; Bureau of Labor Statistics,"Bureau of Labor Statistics, Postal Square Building, Rm 3105, 2 Massachusetts Avenue, NE, Washington, DC 20212. 202-691-6596.; Bureau of Labor Statistics; Alexis Grimm, Bureau of Economic Analysis, 4600 Silver Hill Road, Washington, DC 20233. 202-606-9696.","Bureau of Labor Statistics, Postal Square Building, Rm 3105, 2 Massachusetts Avenue, NE, Washington, DC 20212. 202-691-6596.; Bureau of Labor Statistics; Alexis Grimm, Bureau of Economic Analysis, 4600 Silver Hill Road, Washington, DC 20233. 202-606-9696."

The Persistent Effects of Initial Labor Market Conditions for Young Adults and Their Sources,"Unlucky young workers entering the labor market in recessions suffer a range of medium-to long-term consequences. This paper summarizes the findings of the growing empirical literature on this subject and uses it to assess economic models of career development. The literature finds large initial effects on earnings, labor supply, and wages that tend to fade after ten to fifteen years in the labor market, and that are accompanied by changes in occupation, job mobility, and employer characteristics. Adverse initial labor market entry also has persistent effects on a range of social outcomes, including timing and completed fertility, marriage and divorce, criminal activities, attitudes, and risky alcohol consumption. There is also evidence that early exposure to depressed labor market lowers health and raises mortality in middle age, patterns accompanied by a reopening of earnings gaps.",Till von Wachter,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.34.4.168,"Earnings, Economics, Recession, Labour economics, Consumption (sociology), Demographic economics, Fertility, Labor demand, Medicine, Wage, Population, Social science, Accounting, Environmental health, Sociology, Keynesian economics","University of California, Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA - Institute of Labor Economics; Centre for Economic Policy Research","Till von Wachter is Professor of Economics, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California.

"Information, Mobile Communication, and Referral Effects","We use the universe of de-identified and geocoded cellphone records for 1.8 million individuals from a major Chinese telecommunication provider to examine the role of information exchange in urban labor markets.Information flow, as measured by call volume, correlates strongly with worker flows at different levels of geographic aggregation.Having a referral in a location increases by close to four times the likelihood that a job switcher moves there.Different from the communication pattern between nonreferral pairs, communication between referral pairs exhibits a distinct inverted-U shape that peaks prior to the job switch.Compared with our referral measure, the commonly-used social network proxies deliver a lower bound estimate of the referral effect.We supplement the phone records with administrative data on firm attributes and auxiliary data on job postings and residential housing prices.Referred jobs are associated with higher monetary gains, a higher likelihood to transition from part time to full time, reduced commuting time, and a higher probability of entering desirable jobs.Referral information is more valuable for young workers, people switching jobs from suburbs to the inner city, and those changing their industrial sectors.Firms receiving referred workers are associated with more successful recruits, higher matching rates and faster growth.",Eleonora Patacchini; Panle Jia Barwick; Qi Wu; Yanyan Liu,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w25873,"Referral, Computer science, Internet privacy, Telecommunications, Business, Medical education, Medicine, Family medicine",National Bureau of Economic Research; Cornell University; International Food Policy Research Institute,"Department of Economics Cornell University 430 Uris Hall Ithaca, NY 14853; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Cornell University 462 Uris Hall Ithaca, NY 14853 and; Department of Economics Cornell University 404 Uris Hall Ithaca, NY 14853; IFPRI Senior Fellow Washington, DC 20006","Department of Economics Cornell University 430 Uris Hall Ithaca, NY 14853; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Cornell University 462 Uris Hall Ithaca, NY 14853 and; Department of Economics Cornell University 404 Uris Hall Ithaca, NY 14853; IFPRI Senior Fellow Washington, DC 20006"

Nationalistic Labor Policies Hinder Financial Innovation,"Hiring restrictions for high-skilled foreign nationals hinder domestic banks' production of cutting-edge innovation. We document this fact using the Employ American Workers Act (EAWA), which banned US financial institutions participating in the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) from hiring new high-skilled foreign nationals until the full repayment of TARP funding. We exploit the differential pre-crisis exposure of similarly troubled TARP institutions to the unforeseen EAWA ban to show that the ban not only impeded the hiring of new foreign talent but also led to a reduction in both the quantity and quality of patent filings, including new products and processes in cutting-edge fields such as as FinTech, cybersecurity, and payment systems. Banks more exposed to EAWA did not substitute their internal innovation with the acquisition of external patents. In terms of labor market implications, rather than replacing new high-skilled foreign nationals with domestic employees—the stated goal of EAWA—banks paid higher wage premia to retain pre-crisis foreign hires than the prevailing wages of US workers in the same occupations and locations.",Francesco D'Acunto; Francesco D’Acunto; Hengyi Huang; Jin Xie; Liu Yang; Michael Weber,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4823463,"Business, Wage, Exploit, Asset (computer security), Payment, Financial crisis, Production (economics), Quality (philosophy), Labour economics, Finance, Economics, Philosophy, Computer security, Epistemology, Computer science, Macroeconomics",HSBC Holdings; Georgetown University; Peking University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago; Tilburg University,"National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Georgetown University; University of Chicago - Finance; University of Maryland, Robert H.

Job Transitions and Employee Earnings After Acquisitions: Linking Corporate and Worker Outcomes,"This paper connects changes in employer characteristics through job transitions to employee earnings following mergers and acquisitions (M&As).Using firm balance sheet data linked to individual earnings data in Canada and a matched difference-in-differences design, we find that after M&As acquirers expand while targets shrink substantially relative to their matched control groups.Additionally, profit margins decrease for both acquirers and targets in the medium run.Furthermore, workers at target firms suffer losses in earnings, and this decline in earnings is entirely driven by workers who move to other firms after an M&A event.We find that workers leaving target firms after M&As move to larger firms with higher wage premiums, but with much worse match qualities on average.Taken together, it appears that job transitions to employers with poor match qualities primarily explain the post-M&A decline in worker earnings in our setting.",Amirhossein Tavakoli; David Arnold; Kevin Milligan; Terry Moon,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w31866,"Business, Earnings, Labour economics, Demographic economics, Accounting, Economics","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of British Columbia; International Paper (United States); University of California, San Diego","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; University of British Columbia; 6000 Iona Drive Vancouver School of Economics University of British Columbia Vancouver, B.C.

Capital Structure and a Firm's Workforce,"While businesses require funding to start and grow, they also rely on human capital, which affects how they raise funds. Labor market frictions make financing labor different than financing capital. Unlike capital, labor cannot be owned and can act strategically. Workers face unemployment costs, can negotiate for higher wages, are protected by employment regulations, and face retirement risk. I propose using these frictions as a framework for understanding the unique impact of a firm's workforce on its capital structure. For instance, high leverage often makes managing labor more difficult by undermining employees’ job security and increasing the need for costly workforce reductions. But firms can also use leverage to their advantage, such as in labor negotiations and defined benefit pensions. This research can help firms account for the needs and management of their workforce when making financing decisions.",David A.

Determinants of Disparities in Covid-19 Job Losses,"We make several contributions to understanding the socio-demographic divide in early labor market responses to the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic and its policies, benchmarked against two previous recessions.First, monthly Current Population Survey (CPS) data show greater declines in employment in April and May 2020 (relative to February) for Hispanics, younger workers, and those with high school degrees and some college.Between April and May, all the demographic subgroups considered regained some employment.Re-employment in May was broadly proportional to the employment drop that occurred through April, except for Blacks who experienced a smaller rebound.Further, we show that compared to the 2001 recession and the Great Recession, employment losses in the early COVID-19 recession were smaller for groups with very low or very high (vs.medium) education.Second, we show that job loss was larger in occupations that require more interpersonal contact and that cannot be performed remotely.Third, we find pre-COVID-19 sorting of workers into occupations and industries along demographic lines can explain a sizeable portion of the gender, race, and ethnic gaps in new unemployment.For example, while women did suffer more job losses than men, their disproportionate pre-epidemic sorting into remote work compatible occupations shielded women from what would have been even larger employment losses during the epidemic.However, there remain substantial gaps in employment losses across groups that cannot be explained by socioeconomic differences.We find some larger gaps in labor market impacts when we consider the ""employed but absent from work"" measure present in the CPS, in addition to the more traditional employment and unemployment measures.We conclude with a discussion of policy lessons and future research needs implied by the disparities in early labor market losses from the COVID-19 crisis.",Bruce A.

The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC),"We review research on the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), focusing on work appearing since the Hotz and Scholz (2003) review.Recent work has confirmed earlier findings that labor supply effects are positive for single mothers, smaller and negative for married mothers, and essentially nonexistent for men.Where earlier estimates indicated that all responses were on the extensive margin, some recent studies find evidence of non-zero, but small, intensive margin effects.We also review research on the incidence of the credit, suggesting that employers capture some of the program benefits through lower wages; on the large impact of the program on poverty rates and on children's outcomes; and on families' apparent preferences for lump-sum refunds over smaller payments distributed throughout the year.We present new evidence regarding the accuracy of EITC imputations in the Current Population Survey.We discuss proposals for reform, including a more generous childless credit, and argue that the EITC may be complementary to the minimum wage, rather than an alternative.",Austin Nichols; Jesse Rothstein,,,,,,,,,,,,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w21211,"Earned income tax credit, Economics, Tax credit, Income tax, Labour economics, Business, State income tax, Tax reform, Public economics","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Berkeley","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; DeBruce Foundation's Research Institute; School of Public Policy and Department of Economics University of California, Berkeley 2607 Hearst Avenue Berkeley, CA 94720-7320","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; DeBruce Foundation's Research Institute; School of Public Policy and Department of Economics University of California, Berkeley 2607 Hearst Avenue Berkeley, CA 94720-7320"
Errors in Reporting and Imputation of Government Benefits and Their Implications,"We document the extent, nature, and consequences of survey errors in cash welfare and SNAP receipt in three major U.S. household surveys.We find high rates of misreporting, particularly failure to report receipt.The surveys inaccurately capture patterns of multiple program participation, even though there is little evidence of program confusion.Error rates are higher among imputed observations, which account for a large share of false positive errors.Many household characteristics have significant effects on both false positives and false negative errors.Error rates sharply differ by race, ethnicity, income and other household characteristics.The errors greatly affect models of program receipt and estimated effects of income and race are noticeably biased.We examine error due to item non-response and imputation, as well as whether imputation improves estimates.Item non-respondents have higher receipt rates than the population conditional on covariates.The assumptions for consistent estimates in multivariate models fail both when excluding item non-respondents and when using the imputed values.In binary choice models of program receipt, linked data estimates favor excluding item nonrespondents rather than using imputed values.Biases are well predicted by the error patterns we document, helping researchers make informed decisions on whether to use imputed values.",Bruce Meyer; Nikolas Mittag; Pablo Celhay,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w29184,"Imputation (statistics), Government (linguistics), Accounting, Computer science, Business, Statistics, Actuarial science, Psychology, Missing data, Mathematics, Philosophy, Linguistics",National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic Research and Graduate Education – Economics Institute; Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile; University of Chicago,"CERGE-EI Politických vězňů; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; School of Public Policy University of Chicago 1307 E 60th Street Chicago, IL 60637 and; School of Government and Economics Institute Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile Avda.

"Identifying the Disadvantaged: Official Poverty, Consumption Poverty, and the New Supplemental Poverty Measure","We discuss poverty measurement, focusing on two alternatives to the current official measure: consumption poverty, and the Census Bureau's new Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) that was released for the first time last year. The SPM has advantages over the official poverty measure, including a more defensible adjustment for family size and composition, an expanded definition of the family unit that includes cohabitors, and a definition of income that is conceptually closer to resources available for consumption. The SPM's definition of income, though conceptually broader than pre-tax money income, is difficult to implement given available data and their accuracy. Furthermore, income data do not capture consumption out of savings and tangible assets such as houses and cars. A consumption-based measure has similar advantages but fewer disadvantages. We compare those added to and dropped from the poverty rolls by the alternative measures relative to the current official measure. We find that the SPM adds to poverty individuals who are more likely to be college graduates, own a home and a car, live in a larger housing unit, have air conditioning, health insurance, and substantial assets, and have other more favorable characteristics than those who are dropped from poverty. Meanwhile, we find that a consumption measure compared to the official measure or the SPM adds to the poverty rolls individuals who are more disadvantaged than those who are dropped. We decompose the differences between the SPM and official poverty and find that the most problematic aspect of the SPM is the subtraction of medical out-of-pocket expenses from SPM income. Also, because the SPM poverty thresholds change in an odd way over time, it will be hard to determine if changes in poverty are due to changes in income or changes in thresholds. Our results present strong evidence that a consumption-based poverty measure is preferable to both the official income-based poverty measure and to the Supplemental Poverty Measure for determining who are the most disadvantaged.",Bruce D Meyer; Bruce Meyer; James X Sullivan; James X.

What Can We Learn about the Effects of Food Stamps on Obesity in the Presence of Misreporting?,"Abstract There is an increasing perception among policy makers that food stamp benefits contribute positively to adult obesity rates. We show that these results are heavily dependent on one's assumptions regarding the accuracy of reported food stamp participation. When allowing for misreporting, we find no evidence that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participation significantly increases the probability of being obese or overweight among adults. Our results also highlight the inherent bias and inconsistency of common point estimates when ignoring misreporting, with treatment effects from instrumental variable methods exceeding the nonparametric upper bounds by over 200% in some cases.",Ian McCarthy; Lorenzo Almada; Rusty Tchernis,,,,,,,,,,,,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajae/aaw017,"Instrumental variable, Food stamps, Nonparametric statistics, Food Stamp Program, Overweight, Perception, Obesity, Point (geometry), Econometrics, Variable (mathematics), Portion size, Psychology, Economics, Medicine, Food science, Mathematics, Biology, Endocrinology, Mathematical analysis, Geometry, Neuroscience, Welfare, Market economy",National Bureau of Economic Research; Georgia State University,"Lorenzo Almada is a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University, Ian McCarthy is an assistant professor at Emory University, and Rusty Tchernis is an associate professor at Georgia State University and a research fellow at the Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA) and National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).

The Labor Market Effects of Offshoring by U.S. Multinational Firms,"Abstract We use firm-level data on U.S. multinationals to show how offshoring affects domestic employment within and across firms. We introduce a new instrument for offshoring, bilateral tax treaties, which reduce the cost of offshore activities. We find substantial heterogeneity in effects. A 10% increase in affiliate employment drives a 1.3% increase in employment at the U.S. parent firm, with smaller effects at the industry and regional levels. In contrast, offshoring by vertical multinationals drives declining employment among nonmultinationals in the same industry, and firms opening new affiliates exhibit smaller domestic employment growth than those expanding existing affiliates.",Brian K.

The Labor Market Effects of Offshoring by U.S. Multinational Firms: Evidence from Changes in Global Tax Policies,"Estimating the causal effect of offshoring on domestic employment is notoriously difficult because of the inherent simultaneity of domestic and foreign affiliate employment decisions. We use a model of endogenous offshoring to characterize this simultaneity and to derive an instrumental variables strategy allowing us to estimate the impact of offshore hiring on domestic employment. Our IV strategy exploits variation in offshoring costs across countries, industries, and time that results from the implementation of bilateral tax treaties, and uses Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) firm-level data for U.S. multinationals across two decades. We confirm that new treaties are unrelated to existing employment trends, and proceed to estimate the effects of offshoring on U.S. employment within multinational firms, industry-wide, and within local labor markets. We find that a 10 percent increase in foreign affiliate employment increases domestic U.S. employment for existing multinational firms by 1.4 percent, consistent with increased scale of production following a decline in global production costs. However, industry-wide U.S. employment increases by only one-third as much, as the opening of new offshore production facilities generates substitution for workers that had been hired domestically. We estimate slightly larger effects for local labor markets, suggesting there are possible spillovers across industries in the same location. Throughout the analysis, OLS estimates, which fail to account for the simultaneity of domestic and offshore employment, are more than 3 times larger than the preferred IV estimates. Overall, our results indicate that greater offshore activity raises net employment by U.S. firms.",Brian K.

Labor‐Technology Substitution: Implications for Asset Pricing,"ABSTRACT This paper studies the asset pricing implications of a firm's opportunities to replace routine‐task labor with automation. I develop a model in which firms optimally undertake such replacement when their productivity is low. Hence, firms with routine‐task labor maintain a replacement option that hedges their value against unfavorable macroeconomic shocks and lowers their expected returns. Using establishment‐level occupational data, I construct a measure of firms' share of routine‐task labor. Compared to their industry peers, firms with a higher share of routine‐task labor (i) invest more in machines and reduce more routine‐task labor during economic downturns, and (ii) have lower expected stock returns.",MIAO BEN ZHANG; Miao Ben Zhang,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.12766,"Task (project management), Productivity, Economics, Capital asset pricing model, Stock (firearms), Labour economics, Business, Asset (computer security), Microeconomics, Financial economics, Macroeconomics, Computer science, Engineering, Mechanical engineering, Computer security, Management",Carnegie Mellon University; Miami University; University of Hong Kong,"Cesare Fracassi; Chris Jones; George Korniotis; Jay Shanken; Jerry Hoberg; John Griffin; Jonathan Berk; Jonathan Cohn; Jun Li (discussant); Lars-Alexander Kuehn (discussant); Matthias Kehrig; Miao Ben Zhang is at Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California.

Financing Constraints and Corporate Investment,"Most empirical models of investment rely on the assumption that firms are able to respond to prices set in centralized securities markets (through the ""cost of capital"" or ""q"").An alternative approach emphasizes the importance of cash flow as a determinant of investment spending, because of a ""financing hierarchy,"" in which internal finance has important cost advantages over external finance.We build on recent research concerning imperfections in markets for equity and debt.This work suggests that some firms do not have sufficient access to external capital markets to enable them to respond to changes in the cost of capital, asset prices, or tax-based investment incentives.To the extent that firms are constrained in their ability to raise funds externally, investment spending may be sensitive to the availability of internal finance.That is, investment may display ""excess sensitivity"" to movements in cash flow.En this paper, we work within the q theory of investment, and examine the importance of a financing hierarchy created by capital-market imperfections.Using panel data on individual manufacturing firms, we compare the investment behavior of rapidly growing firms that exhaust all of their internal finance with that of mature firms paying dividends.We find that q values remain very high for significant periods of time for firms paying no dividends, relative to those for mature firms.We also find that investment is more sensitive to cash flow for the group of firms that our model implies is most likely to face external finance constraints.These results are consistent with the augmented model we propose, which takes into account different financing regimes for different groups of firms.Some extensions and implications for public policy are discussed at the end.",Bruce C.

"Production Networks, Geography, and Firm Performance","This paper examines the importance of buyer-supplier relationships for firm performance. We develop a model in which firms outsource tasks and search for suppliers. Lower search and outsourcing costs lead firms to search more and find better suppliers, which in turn drives down marginal costs. We test the theory by exploiting the opening of a high-speed train line in Japan, which lowered the cost of passenger travel but left shipping costs unchanged. Using an exhaustive data set on firms’ buyer-seller linkages, we find significant improvements in firm performance as well as creation of buyer-seller links, consistent with the model.",Andreas Moxnes; Andrew B.

The Granular Nature of Large Institutional Investors,"Large institutional investors own an increasing share of the equity markets in the United States. The implications of this development for financial markets are still unclear. The paper presents novel empirical evidence that ownership by large institutions predicts higher volatility and greater noise in stock prices as well as greater fragility in times of crisis. When studying the channel, we find that large institutional investors exhibit traits of granularity (i.e., subunits within a firm display correlated behavior), which reduces diversification of idiosyncratic shocks. Thus, large institutions trade larger volumes and induce greater price impact. This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, finance.",Francesco A.

Exploration for Human Capital: Evidence from the MBA Labor Market,"We empirically investigate the effect of uncertainty on corporate hiring. Using novel data from the labor market for MBA graduates, we show that uncertainty regarding how well job candidates fit with a firm's industry hinders hiring and that firms value probationary work arrangements that provide the option to learn more about potential full-time employees. The detrimental effect of uncertainty on hiring is more pronounced when firms face greater firing and replacement costs and when they face less direct competition from other similar firms. These results suggest that firms faced with uncertainty use similar considerations when making hiring decisions as when making decisions regarding investment in physical capital.",Camelia M.

Reallocation in the Great Recession: Cleansing or Not?,"The high pace of reallocation across producers is pervasive in the US economy. Evidence shows that this high pace of reallocation is closely linked to productivity. While these patterns hold on average, the extent to which the reallocation dynamics in recessions are “cleansing” is an open question. We find that downturns prior to the Great Recession are periods of accelerated reallocation even more productivity enhancing than reallocation in normal times. In the Great Recession, we find that the intensity of reallocation fell rather than rose and that the reallocation that did occur was less productivity enhancing than in prior recessions.",Cheryl Grim; John Haltiwanger; Lucia Foster,,,,,,,,,,,,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1086/682397,"Recession, Pace, Economics, Productivity, Great recession, Labour economics, Monetary economics, Macroeconomics, Geography, Geodesy",United States Census Bureau; National Bureau of Economic Research,University of Maryland and National Bureau of Economic Research; US Census Bureau,University of Maryland and National Bureau of Economic Research; US Census Bureau

The Decline of the U.S. Rust Belt: A Macroeconomic Analysis,"No region of the United States fared worse over the postwar period than the ""Rust Belt,"" the heavy manufacturing zone bordering the Great Lakes. We argue that a lack of competition in labor and output markets in the Rust Belt were responsible for much of the region's decline. We formalize this theory in a dynamic general-equilibrium model in which productivity growth and regional employment shares are determined by the extent of competition. When plausibly calibrated, the model explains roughly half the decline in the Rust Belt's manufacturing employment share. Industry evidence support the model's predictions that investment and productivity growth rates were relatively low in the Rust Belt.",David Lagakos; Lee E.

Capital Allocation and Productivity in South Europe*,"Abstract Starting in the early 1990s, countries in southern Europe experienced low productivity growth alongside declining real interest rates. We use data for manufacturing firms in Spain between 1999 and 2012 to document a significant increase in the dispersion of the return to capital across firms, a stable dispersion of the return to labor, and a significant increase in productivity losses from capital misallocation over time. We develop a model with size-dependent financial frictions that is consistent with important aspects of firms’ behavior in production and balance sheet data. We illustrate how the decline in the real interest rate, often attributed to the euro convergence process, leads to a significant decline in sectoral total factor productivity as capital inflows are misallocated toward firms that have higher net worth but are not necessarily more productive. We show that similar trends in dispersion and productivity losses are observed in Italy and Portugal but not in Germany, France, and Norway.",Carolina Villegas-Sanchez; Carolina Villegas‐Sánchez; Gita Gopinath; Loukas Karabarbounis; Şebnem Kalemli-Özcan; Ṣebnem Kalemli‐Özcan,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjx024,"Productivity, Convergence (economics), Economics, Total factor productivity, Balance sheet, Dispersion (optics), Capital (architecture), Production (economics), Monetary economics, Labour economics, Macroeconomics, Geography, Finance, Physics, Archaeology, Optics",Universitat Ramon Llull; University of Minnesota; Center for Economic and Policy Research; Harvard University,"University of Minnesota, FRB of Minneapolis, and NBER; Harvard University and NBER; University of Maryland, NBER, and CEPR; Esade – Universitat Ramon Llull","University of Minnesota, FRB of Minneapolis, and NBER; Harvard University and NBER; University of Maryland, NBER, and CEPR; Esade – Universitat Ramon Llull"
Distortions in Production Networks*,"Abstract How does an economy’s production structure determine its macroeconomic response to sectoral distortions? We study a static, multisector framework in which production is organized in an input-output network and production decisions are distorted. Sectoral distortions manifest at the aggregate level via two channels: total factor productivity (TFP) and the labor wedge. We show that near efficiency, distortions have zero first-order effects on TFP and nonzero first-order effects on the labor wedge, and that a sufficient statistic for the latter are the Domar weights. We thereby provide a Hulten-like theorem for the aggregate effects of sectoral distortions. A quantitative application of the model to the 2008–09 financial crisis suggests that the U.S. input-output structure amplified financial distortions by roughly a factor of two during the crisis.",Jennifer La’O; Saki Bigio,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjaa018,"Total factor productivity, Economics, Econometrics, Statistic, Production (economics), Financial crisis, Productivity, Wedge (geometry), Aggregate (composite), Order (exchange), Macroeconomics, Mathematics, Statistics, Finance, Materials science, Geometry, Composite material","University of California, Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research","University of California, Los Angeles and National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University and National Bureau of Economic Research","University of California, Los Angeles and National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University and National Bureau of Economic Research"
Misallocation and Capital Market Integration: Evidence From India,"We show that foreign capital liberalization reduces capital misallocation and increases aggregate productivity for affected industries in India. The staggered liberalization of access to foreign capital across disaggregated industries allows us to identify changes in firms' input wedges, overcoming major challenges in the measurement of the effects of changing misallocation. Liberalization increases capital overall. For domestic firms with initially high marginal revenue products of capital (MRPK), liberalization increases revenues by 23%, physical capital by 53%, wage bills by 28%, and reduces MRPK by 33% relative to low MRPK firms. The effects of liberalization are largest in areas with less developed local banking sectors, indicating that inefficiencies in that sector may cause misallocation. Finally, we propose an assumption under which a novel method exploiting natural experiments can be used to bound the effect of changes in misallocation on treated industries' aggregate productivity. These industries' Solow residual increases by 3–16%.",Adrien Matray; Natalie Bau,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.3982/ecta19039,"Solow residual, Economics, Monetary economics, Liberalization, Capital (architecture), Marginal revenue, Productivity, Revenue, International economics, Physical capital, Capital intensity, Total factor productivity, Labour economics, Macroeconomics, Growth accounting, Human capital, Market economy, Finance, History, Archaeology",Princeton University; Center for Economic and Policy Research,"Department of Economics, UCLA, NBER, and CEPR; Department of Economics, Princeton University, NBER,","Department of Economics, UCLA, NBER, and CEPR; Department of Economics, Princeton University, NBER,"
The Role of Nonemployers in Business Dynamism and Aggregate Productivity,"The well-documented decline in business dynamism, measured by the net entry rate of employer firms, has been proposed as an explanation for the productivity growth slowdown in the United States.We assess the role of nonemployers, firms without paid employees, in business dynamism and aggregate productivity.Including nonemployers, the total number of firms has instead increased since the early 1980s, which in the context of a standard model of firm dynamics implies an annualized growth of measured aggregate productivity of 0.22%, one-quarter of the productivity growth in the data.Further accounting for time changes in the share of nonemployer firms and in the distribution of employment across firms, we find that productivity growth is even higher (0.47% per year).The productivity growth slowdown is not due to changes in net firm entry.",Diego Restuccia; Pedro Bento,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w25998,"Dynamism, Aggregate (composite), Productivity, Business, Industrial organization, Economics, Materials science, Composite material, Physics, Quantum mechanics, Macroeconomics",University of Toronto; National Bureau of Economic Research; Texas A&M University,"Texas A&M University 1101 Hollow Creek Dr. Unit 2208 Austin, TX 78704; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of Toronto 150 St. George Street Toronto, ON M5S 3G7 and;  University of Texas at Austin, the 2019 Midwest Macroeconomic Meetings at Michigan State University, the 2019 RCEA Growth, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Conference at Wilfrid Laurier University,;  Society for Economic Dynamics Meetings at the University of Minnesota, Texas A&M University, the","Texas A&M University 1101 Hollow Creek Dr. Unit 2208 Austin, TX 78704; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of Toronto 150 St. George Street Toronto, ON M5S 3G7 and;  University of Texas at Austin, the 2019 Midwest Macroeconomic Meetings at Michigan State University, the 2019 RCEA Growth, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Conference at Wilfrid Laurier University,;  Society for Economic Dynamics Meetings at the University of Minnesota, Texas A&M University, the"
The Welfare Effects of Encouraging Rural-Urban Migration,"This paper studies the welfare effects of encouraging rural-urban migration in the developing world.To do so, we build a dynamic incomplete-markets model of migration in which heterogenous agents face seasonal income fluctuations, stochastic income shocks, and disutility of migration that depends on past migration experience.We calibrate the model to replicate a field experiment that subsidized migration in rural Bangladesh, leading to significant increases in both migration rates and in consumption for induced migrants.The model's welfare predictions for migration subsidies are driven by two main features of the model and data: first, induced migrants tend to be negatively selected on income and assets; second, the model's non-monetary disutility of migration is substantial, which we validate using using newly collected survey data from this same experimental sample.The average welfare gains are similar in magnitude to those obtained from an unconditional cash transfer, though migration subsidies lead to larger gains for the poorest households, which have the greatest propensity to migrate.",Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak; David Lagakos; Michael Waugh,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w24193,"Welfare, Economic geography, Environmental planning, Geography, Natural resource economics, Economics, Market economy","University of California, Irvine; National Bureau of Economic Research; Yale University; University of California, San Diego; New York University","School of Business New York University 44 West Fourth Street, Suite 7-160 New York, NY 10012; Yale School of Management 135 Prospect Street Box 208200 New Haven, CT 06520 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; IIES, UC Irvine, UNC, USC Marshall, Washington, Yale, Zurich,; NYU, St. Andrews, Stockholm; participants at Barcelona, Bristol, Chicago, Edinburgh, the Einaudi Institute, Fordham, the Hong Kong School of Economics and Finance,; Department of Economics, 0508 University of California, San Diego 9500 Gilman Drive La Jolla, CA 92093 and","School of Business New York University 44 West Fourth Street, Suite 7-160 New York, NY 10012; Yale School of Management 135 Prospect Street Box 208200 New Haven, CT 06520 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; IIES, UC Irvine, UNC, USC Marshall, Washington, Yale, Zurich,; NYU, St. Andrews, Stockholm; participants at Barcelona, Bristol, Chicago, Edinburgh, the Einaudi Institute, Fordham, the Hong Kong School of Economics and Finance,; Department of Economics, 0508 University of California, San Diego 9500 Gilman Drive La Jolla, CA 92093 and"
The Impact of Uncertainty Shocks,"Uncertainty appears to jump up after major shocks like the Cuban Missile crisis, the assassination of JFK, the OPEC I oil-price shock and the 9/11 terrorist attack. This paper offers a structural framework to analyze the impact of these uncertainty shocks. I build a model with a time varying second moment, which is numerically solved and estimated using firm level data. The parameterized model is then used to simulate a macro uncertainty shock, which produces a rapid drop and rebound in aggregate output and employment. This occurs because higher uncertainty causes firms to temporarily pause their investment and hiring. Productivity growth also falls because this pause in activity freezes reallocation across units. In the medium term the increased volatility from the shock induces an overshoot in output, employment and productivity. Thus, second moment shocks generate short sharp recessions and recoveries. This simulated impact of an uncertainty shock is compared to VAR estimations on actual data, showing a good match in both magnitude and timing. The paper also jointly estimates labor and capital convex and non-convex adjustment costs. Ignoring capital adjustment costs is shown to lead to substantial bias while ignoring labor adjustment costs does not.",Nicholas Bloom,,,,,,,,,,,,2009.0,https://doi.org/10.3982/ecta6248,"Economics, Econometrics, Environmental science",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research, National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Stanford University - Department of Economics, National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Stanford University - Department of Economics
Uncertainty Shocks in a Model of Effective Demand,"This paper examines the role of uncertainty shocks in a one-sector, representative-agent dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium model. When prices are exible, uncertainty shocks are not capable of producing business-cycle comovements among key macro variables. With countercyclical markups through sticky prices, however, uncertainty shocks can generate uctuations that are consistent with business cycles. Monetary policy usually plays a key role in osetting the negative impact of uncertainty shocks. If the central bank is constrained by the zero lower bound, then monetary policy can no longer perform its usual stabilizing function and higher uncertainty has even more negative eects on the economy. Calibrating the size of uncertainty shocks using uctuations in the VIX, we nd that increased uncertainty about the future may indeed have played a signicant role in worsening the Great Recession, which is consistent with statements by policymakers, economists, and the nancial press.",Brent Bundick; Susanto Basu,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.3982/ecta13960,"Economics, Econometrics, Demand shock, Macroeconomics",National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City,"Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Kansas City, MO, U.S.A.; National Bureau of Economic Research CambridgeMA02138U.S.A.","Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Kansas City, MO, U.S.A.; National Bureau of Economic Research CambridgeMA02138U.S.A."
Uncertainty and Business Cycles: Exogenous Impulse or Endogenous Response?,"Uncertainty about the future rises in recessions. But is uncertainty a source of business cycles or an endogenous response to them, and does the type of uncertainty matter? We propose a novel SVAR identification strategy to address these questions via inequality constraints on the structural shocks. We find that sharply higher macroeconomic uncertainty in recessions is often an endogenous response to output shocks, while uncertainty about financial markets is a likely source of output fluctuations.

The Finance Uncertainty Multiplier,"We show how real and financial frictions amplify, prolong and propagate the negative impact of uncertainty shocks.We first use a novel instrumentation strategy to address endogeneity in estimating the impact of uncertainty by exploiting differential firm exposure to exchange rate, policy, and energy price volatility in a panel of US firms.Using common proxies for financial constraints we show that ex-ante financially constrained firms cut their investment even more than unconstrained firms following an uncertainty shock.We then build a general equilibrium heterogeneous firms model with real and financial frictions, finding financial frictions: i) amplify uncertainty shocks by doubling their impact on output; ii) increase persistence by extending the duration of the drop by 50%; and iii) propagate uncertainty shocks by spreading their impact onto financial variables.These results highlight why in periods of greater financial frictions uncertainty can be particularly damaging.",Iván Alfaro; Nicholas Bloom; Xiaoji Lin,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w24571,"Multiplier (economics), Economics, Mathematical economics, Mathematics, Computer science, Keynesian economics",Stanford University; Texas A&M University; National Bureau of Economic Research; BI Norwegian Business School; United States Congress; University of Minnesota; University College London; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,"PBC of Tsinghua University, SAIF, Society for Nonlinear Dynamics and Econometrics, Stanford, Ohio State University, Texas A&M University, UBC Summer Finance Conference, University College London, UCSD, University of Minnesota, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of Southern California, University of St. Andrews, USC,; Stanford University Department of Economics 579 Jane Stanford Way Stanford, CA 94305-6072; Georegetown University, London; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management 321 19th Ave S.

Changing Business Dynamism and Productivity: Shocks versus Responsiveness,"The pace of job reallocation has declined in the United States in recent decades. We draw insight from canonical models of business dynamics in which reallocation can decline due to (i ) lower dis persion of idiosyncratic shocks faced by businesses, or (ii ) weaker marginal responsiveness of businesses to shocks. We show that shock dispersion has actually risen, while the responsiveness of business-level employment to productivity has weakened. Moreover, declining responsiveness can account for a significant fraction of the decline in the pace of job reallocation, and we find suggestive evidence this has been a drag on aggregate productivity.

The uncertainty measures reflect changes in both the conditional mean and volatility of the variables, and their impact on the economy can be assessed within the same framework.

Does the Squeaky Wheel Get More Grease? The Direct and Indirect Effects of Citizen Participation on Environmental Governance in China,"We conducted a nationwide field experiment in China to evaluate the direct and indirect impacts of assigning firms to public or private citizen appeals when they violate pollution standards. There are three main findings. First, public appeals to the regulator through social media substantially reduce violations and pollution emissions, while private appeals cause more modest environmental improvements. Second, public appeals appear to tilt regulators’ focus away from facilitating economic growth and toward avoiding pollution-induced public unrest. Third, pollution reductions by treated firms are not offset by control firms, based on randomly varying the proportion of treated firms at the prefecture level.

The economic impacts of ecosystem disruptions: Costs from substituting biological pest control,"Biodiversity loss is accelerating, yet we know little about how these ecosystem disruptions affect human well-being. Ecologists have documented both the importance of bats as natural predators of insects as well as their population declines after the emergence of a wildlife disease, resulting in a potential decline in biological pest control. In this work, I study how species interactions can extend beyond an ecosystem and affect agriculture and human health. I find that farmers compensated for bat decline by increasing their insecticide use by 31.1%. The compensatory increase in insecticide use by farmers adversely affected health-human infant mortality increased by 7.9% in the counties that experienced bat die-offs.

Hydraulic fracturing and infant health: New evidence from Pennsylvania,"The development of hydraulic fracturing (""fracking"") is considered the biggest change to the global energy production system in the last half-century. However, several communities have banned fracking because of unresolved concerns about the impact of this process on human health. To evaluate the potential health impacts of fracking, we analyzed records of more than 1.1 million births in Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2013, comparing infants born to mothers living at different distances from active fracking sites and those born both before and after fracking was initiated at each site. We adjusted for fixed maternal determinants of infant health by comparing siblings who were and were not exposed to fracking sites in utero. We found evidence for negative health effects of in utero exposure to fracking sites within 3 km of a mother's residence, with the largest health impacts seen for in utero exposure within 1 km of fracking sites. Negative health impacts include a greater incidence of low-birth weight babies as well as significant declines in average birth weight and in several other measures of infant health. There is little evidence for health effects at distances beyond 3 km, suggesting that health impacts of fracking are highly local. Informal estimates suggest that about 29,000 of the nearly 4 million annual U.S. births occur within 1 km of an active fracking site and that these births therefore may be at higher risk of poor birth outcomes.",Janet Currie; Katherine Meckel; Michael Greenstone,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1603021,"Hydraulic fracturing, Environmental science, Medicine, Environmental health, Geology, Petroleum engineering","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Los Angeles; Princeton University; University of Chicago","National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.; University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.; Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA.; University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024, USA.","National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.; University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.; Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA.; University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024, USA."
The low but uncertain measured benefits of US water quality policy,"US investment to decrease pollution in rivers, lakes, and other surface waters has exceeded $1.9 trillion since 1960, and has also exceeded the cost of most other US environmental initiatives. These investments come both from the 1972 Clean Water Act and the largely voluntary efforts to control pollution from agriculture and urban runoff. This paper reviews the methods and conclusions of about 20 recent evaluations of these policies. Surprisingly, most analyses estimate that these policies’ benefits are much smaller than their costs; the benefit–cost ratio from the median study is 0.37. However, existing evidence is limited and undercounts many types of benefits. We conclude that it is unclear whether many of these regulations truly fail a benefit–cost test or whether existing evidence understates their net benefits; we also describe specific questions that when answered would help eliminate this uncertainty.",Catherine L.

Who’s Minding the Kids? Experimental Evidence on the Demand for Child Care Quality,"Despite the well-documented benefits of high-quality child care, many preschool-age children in the U.S. attend low-quality programs.Accordingly, improving the quality of child care is increasingly an explicit goal of government policy.However, accomplishing this goal requires a thorough understanding of the factors that influence parents' child care decisions.This paper provides the first evidence on the demand for child care characteristics in the market for homebased care.Using a randomized audit design, we study three dimensions of caregiving: affordability (i.e., the hourly price of child care), quality (i.e., caregiver education and experience), and convenience (i.e., caregiver car ownership and availability).We find that while parents are extremely sensitive to the cost of child care, they also have strong preferences for quality, particularly caregivers' educational attainment.Furthermore, we obtain mixed results on the convenience dimensions of child care, with parents valuing those owning a car but not those with more availability.Finally, we find significant heterogeneity in child care preferences according to families' age of youngest child, race and ethnicity, and willingness-to-pay.Our findings are consistent with the notion that the problem of low-quality in the U.S. child care market may be explained by lack of affordability or the informational resources to identify highquality care, rather than an undervaluation of such care by parents.",Chris Herbst; Chris M.

Governance Matters IV : Governance Indicators For 1996-2004,"No AccessPolicy Research Working Papers21 Jun 2013Governance Matters IV : Governance Indicators For 1996-2004Authors/Editors: Daniel Kaufmann, Aart Kraay, Massimo MastruzziDaniel Kaufmann, Aart Kraay, Massimo Mastruzzihttps://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-3630SectionsAboutPDF (0.7 MB) ToolsAdd to favoritesDownload CitationsTrack Citations ShareFacebookTwitterLinked In Abstract:The authors present the latest update of their aggregate governance indicators, together with new analysis of several issues related to the use of these measures. The governance indicators measure the following six dimensions of governance: (1) voice and accountability; (2) political instability and violence; (3) government effectiveness; (4) regulatory quality; (5) rule of law, and (6) control of corruption. They cover 209 countries and territories for 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2004. They are based on several hundred individual variables measuring perceptions of governance, drawn from 37 separate data sources constructed by 31 organizations. The authors present estimates of the six dimensions of governance for each period, as well as margins of error capturing the range of likely values for each country. These margins of error are not unique to perceptions-based measures of governance, but are an important feature of all efforts to measure governance, including objective indicators. In fact, the authors give examples of how individual objective measures provide an incomplete picture of even the quite particular dimensions of governance that they are intended to measure. The authors also analyze in detail changes over time in their estimates of governance; provide a framework for assessing the statistical significance of changes in governance; and suggest a simple rule of thumb for identifying statistically significant changes in country governance over time. The ability to identify significant changes in governance over time is much higher for aggregate indicators than for any individual indicator. While the authors find that the quality of governance in a number of countries has changed significantly (in both directions), they also provide evidence suggesting that there are no trends, for better or worse, in global averages of governance. Finally, they interpret the strong observed correlation between income and governance, and argue against recent efforts to apply a discount to governance performance in low-income countries.

Do Female Executives Make a Difference? The Impact of Female Leadership on Gender Gaps and Firm Performance,"Abstract We investigate the effects of female executives on gender-specific wage distributions and firm performance. Female leadership has a positive impact at the top of the female wage distribution and a negative impact at the bottom. The impact of female leadership on firm performance increases with the share of female workers. We account for the endogeneity induced by non-random executives’ gender by including firm fixed-effects, by generating controls from a two-way fixed-effects regression and by using instruments based on regional trends. The findings are consistent with a model of statistical discrimination in which female executives are better at interpreting signals of productivity from female workers.

Do Firms Respond to Gender Pay Gap Transparency?,"We examine the effect of pay transparency on gender pay gap and firm outcomes.This paper exploits a 2006 legislation change in Denmark that requires firms to provide gender disaggregated wage statistics.Using detailed employee-employer administrative data and a difference-in-differences and difference-in-discontinuities designs, we find the law reduces the gender pay gap, primarily by slowing the wage growth for male employees.The gender pay gap declines by approximately two percentage points, or a 13% reduction relative to the pre-legislation mean.Despite the reduction of the overall wage bill, the wage-transparency mandate does not affect firm profitability, likely because of the offsetting effect of reduced firm productivity.",Daniel Wolfenzon; Elena Simintzi; Margarita Tsoutsoura; Morten Bennedsen,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w25435,"Transparency (behavior), Gender pay gap, Business, Gender gap, Labour economics, Economics, Political science, Law, Wage",Columbia University; Cornell University; National Bureau of Economic Research; SC Johnson (United States); INSEAD; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,"Cornell University Ithaca, NY 14853; UIC, UCLA, ASU, and conference participants at LBS Summer Finance Symposium, Stanford SITE; Graduate School of Business Columbia University Uris Hall, Room 808 3022 Broadway New York, NY 10027; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; UC San Diego, IESE Barcelona, Columbia Business School, Cornell University, Darden, INSEAD,; Department of Economics INSEAD Fontainebleau France; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Kenan-Flagler Business School Chapel Hill, NC United States; SC Johnson College of Business","Cornell University Ithaca, NY 14853; UIC, UCLA, ASU, and conference participants at LBS Summer Finance Symposium, Stanford SITE; Graduate School of Business Columbia University Uris Hall, Room 808 3022 Broadway New York, NY 10027; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; UC San Diego, IESE Barcelona, Columbia Business School, Cornell University, Darden, INSEAD,; Department of Economics INSEAD Fontainebleau France; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Kenan-Flagler Business School Chapel Hill, NC United States; SC Johnson College of Business"

Women Helping Women? Evidence from Private Sector Data on Workplace Hierarchies,"This paper studies gender spillovers in career advancement using 11 years of mployer-employee matched data on the population of white-collar workers at over 4,000 private-sector establishments in Norway. Our data include unusually detailed job information for each worker, which enables us to define seven hierarchical ranks that are consistent across establishments and over time in order to measure promotions (defined as year-to-year rank increases) even for individuals who change employers. We first find that women have significantly lower promotion rates than men across all ranks of the corporate hierarchy, even after controlling for a range of individual characteristics (age, education, tenure, experience) and including fixed effects for current rank, year, industry, and even work establishment. In measuring the effects of female coworkers, we find positive gender spillovers across ranks (flowing from higher-ranking to lower-ranking women) but negative spillovers within ranks. The finding that greater female representation at higher ranks narrows the gender gap in promotion rates at lower ranks suggests that policies that increase female representation in corporate leadership can have spillover benefits to women in lowers ranks.",Amalia R.

Mandating Women on Boards: Evidence from the United States,"On September 30, 2018, California became the first U.S. state to set quotas for women directors on corporate boards. The passage of this law resulted in a significant decline in shareholder value for firms headquartered in California. The decline in shareholder value is directly related to the number of female directors that firms are required to add under these quotas. We argue that supply-side constraints contribute to the costs imposed by the mandate. The expected costs of the quotas are higher for firms that face a more limited director pool and for those with weak corporate governance. Earnings forecasts for California firms also decline after the passage of the law. The law is associated with a widening of credit default spreads for affected firms, suggesting that differences in risk-taking preferences between male and female directors do not explain the results.",Anil Shivdasani; Elena Simintzi; Sunwoo Hwang,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3265783,"Business, Political science",Korea University; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Centre for Economic Policy Research; Flagler College,University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill - Kenan-Flagler Business School; Korea University Business School; University of North Carolina Kenan-Flagler Business School; Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR),University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill - Kenan-Flagler Business School; Korea University Business School; University of North Carolina Kenan-Flagler Business School; Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR)
Who Wears the Pants? Gender Identity Norms and Intrahousehold Financial Decision‐Making,"ABSTRACT Using microdata from U.S. household surveys, I document that families with a financially sophisticated husband are more likely to participate in the stock market than those with a wife of equal financial sophistication. This pattern is best explained by gender identity norms, which constrain women's influence over intrahousehold financial decision‐making. A randomized controlled experiment reveals that female identity hinders idea contribution by the wife. These findings underscore the roles of intrahousehold bargaining and traditional norms in shaping household financial decisions.",DA KE; Da Ke,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13002,"Wife, Sophistication, Microdata (statistics), Identity (music), Gender identity, Economics, Stock market, Gender role, Demographic economics, Sociology, Social psychology, Psychology, Political science, Geography, Law, Demography, Social science, Population, Physics, Acoustics, Census, Context (archaeology), Archaeology",American Economic Association; University of Hong Kong,"I am deeply indebted to my advisor, Henrik Cronqvist, for his invaluable guidance and constant support.

The Economic Impact of Hurricane Katrina on Its Victims: Evidence from Individual Tax Returns,"Hurricane Katrina destroyed over 200,000 homes and led to massive economic and physical dislocation. Using a panel of tax return data, we provide one of the first comprehensive analyses of the hurricane's long-term economic impact on its victims. Hurricane Katrina had large and persistent impacts on where people live, but small and surprisingly transitory effects on employment and income. Within just a few years, Katrina victims' incomes actually surpass that of controls from similar unaffected cities. The strong economic performance of Hurricane Katrina victims is particularly remarkable given that the hurricane struck with essentially no warning. (JEL D14, H24, Q53, R23)",Laura Kawano; Steven D.

Skewed Idiosyncratic Income Risk over the Business Cycle: Sources and Insurance,"We provide new evidence on business cycle fluctuations in skewed labor income risk in the United States, Germany, Sweden, and France. We document four results. First, in all countries, the skewness of individual income growth is strongly procyclical, whereas its variance is flat and acyclical. Second, this result also holds for continuously employed, full-time workers, indicating that the hours margin is not the main driver; additional analyses of hours and wages confirm that both margins are important. Third, within-household smoothing does not seem effective at mitigating skewness fluctuations. Fourth, tax-and-transfer policies blunt some of the largest declines in incomes, reducing procyclical fluctuations in skewness.

Cross-Sectional Uncertainty and the Business Cycle: Evidence from 40 Years of Options Data,"This paper presents a novel and unique measure of cross-sectional uncertainty constructed from stock options on individual firms. Cross-sectional uncertainty varied little between 1980 and 1995, and subsequently had three distinct peaks -- during the tech boom, the financial crisis, and the coronavirus epidemic. Cross-sectional uncertainty has had a mixed relationship with overall economic activity, and aggregate uncertainty is much more powerful for forecasting aggregate growth. The data and moments can be used to calibrate and test structural models of the effects of uncertainty shocks. In international data, we find similar dynamics and a strong common factor in cross-sectional uncertainty. The data is available on our websites.

Macroeconomic Responses to Uncertainty Shocks: The Perils of Recursive Orderings,"A common practice in empirical macroeconomics is to examine alternative recursive orderings of the variables in structural vector autogressive (VAR) models. When the implied impulse responses look similar, the estimates are considered trustworthy. When they do not, the estimates are used to bound the true response without directly addressing the identification challenge. A leading example of this practice is the literature on the effects of uncertainty shocks on economic activity. We prove by counterexample that this practice is invalid in general, whether the data generating process is a structural VAR model or a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model.",Alexander W.

"Uncertainty, Wages and the Business Cycle","Abstract We show that limited wage flexibility in economic downturns generates strong and state-dependent amplification of uncertainty shocks. It also explains the cyclical behaviour of empirical measures of uncertainty. In the presence of matching frictions, an occasionally binding constraint on downward wage adjustment enhances the concavity of firms’ hiring rule, resulting in an endogenous profit risk-premium. In turn, higher uncertainty increases the profit risk-premium when the economy operates close to the wage constraint, deepening a recession. Non-linear local projections and vector autoregression estimates support the model predictions. In addition, we show that measured uncertainty rises in a recession even without uncertainty shocks.",Federico Ravenna; Matteo Cacciatore,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/ueab019,"Economics, Business cycle, Wage, Recession, Constraint (computer-aided design), Econometrics, Great recession, Profit (economics), Matching (statistics), Flexibility (engineering), Risk premium, Monetary economics, Labour economics, Macroeconomics, Microeconomics, Mathematics, Statistics, Geometry, Management",Danmarks Nationalbank; Bank of Canada; HEC Montréal; University of Copenhagen,"HEC Montréal, Bank of Canada & NBER, Canada; Danmarks Nationalbank, University of Copenhagen, HEC Montréal & CEPR, Denmark","HEC Montréal, Bank of Canada & NBER, Canada; Danmarks Nationalbank, University of Copenhagen, HEC Montréal & CEPR, Denmark"
Shocks versus Responsiveness: What Drives Time-Varying Dispersion?,"The dispersion of many economic variables is countercyclical. What drives this fact? Greater dispersion could arise from greater volatility of shocks or from agents responding more to shocks of constant size. Without data separately measuring exogenous shocks and endogenous responses, a theoretical debate between these explanations has emerged. In this paper, we provide novel identification using price data in the open-economy environment: using confidential BLS microdata, we document a robust positive relationship between exchange rate pass-through and the dispersion of item-level price changes. We then show that this relationship supports models with time-varying responsiveness.",David Berger; Joseph Vavra,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1086/701790,"Microdata (statistics), Economics, Volatility (finance), Econometrics, Dispersion (optics), Exchange rate, Price dispersion, Monetary economics, Medicine, Physics, Optics, Population, Environmental health, Census",National Bureau of Economic Research,Northwestern University and National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago and National Bureau of Economic Research,Northwestern University and National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago and National Bureau of Economic Research
The Rise of Market Power and the Macroeconomic Implications*,"Abstract We document the evolution of market power based on firm-level data for the U.S. economy since 1955. We measure both markups and profitability. In 1980, aggregate markups start to rise from 21% above marginal cost to 61% now. The increase is driven mainly by the upper tail of the markup distribution: the upper percentiles have increased sharply. Quite strikingly, the median is unchanged. In addition to the fattening upper tail of the markup distribution, there is reallocation of market share from low- to high-markup firms. This rise occurs mostly within industry. We also find an increase in the average profit rate from 1% to 8%. Although there is also an increase in overhead costs, the markup increase is in excess of overhead. We discuss the macroeconomic implications of an increase in average market power, which can account for a number of secular trends in the past four decades, most notably the declining labor and capital shares as well as the decrease in labor market dynamism.",Gabriel Unger; Jan De Loecker; Jan Eeckhout,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjz041,"Economics, Market power, Dynamism, Markup language, Monetary economics, Wage share, Market share, Profitability index, Distribution (mathematics), Profit (economics), Marginal cost, Labour economics, Microeconomics, Monopoly, Wage, Mathematical analysis, Physics, Mathematics, Finance, Quantum mechanics, Computer science, XML, Efficiency wage, Operating system",Pompeu Fabra University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University Press; Centre for Economic Policy Research; KU Leuven; Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats,"Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona (Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies, Graduate School of Economics); Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, National Bureau of Economic Research, and Centre for Economic Policy Research; Harvard University","Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona (Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies, Graduate School of Economics); Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, National Bureau of Economic Research, and Centre for Economic Policy Research; Harvard University"
Effects of ACA Medicaid Expansions on Health Insurance Coverage and Labor Supply,"We examined the effect of the expansion of Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act on health insurance coverage and labor supply of low-educated and low-income adults. We found that the Medicaid expansions were associated with large increases in Medicaid coverage, for example, 50 percent among childless adults, and corresponding decreases in the proportion uninsured. There was relatively little change in private insurance coverage, although the expansions tended to decrease such coverage slightly. In terms of labor supply, estimates indicated that the Medicaid expansions had little effect on work effort despite the substantial changes in health insurance coverage. Most estimates suggested that the expansions increased work effort, although not significantly.",Anuj Gangopadhyaya; Bowen Garrett; Caitlyn Fleming; Jiajia Chen; Robert Kaestner,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/pam.21993,"Medicaid, Health insurance, Demographic economics, Private insurance, Work (physics), Public health insurance, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Business, Health care, Economics, Economic growth, Mechanical engineering, Engineering","University of California, Riverside; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Illinois Chicago; Urban Institute","School of Public Policy & Department of Economics University of California, Riverside 4165 Interdisciplinary South 900 University Avenue Riverside, CA 92521 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Health Policy Center Urban Institute 2100 M Street NW Washington, DC 20037; Department of Economics University of Illinois at Chicago Chicago, IL 60607","School of Public Policy & Department of Economics University of California, Riverside 4165 Interdisciplinary South 900 University Avenue Riverside, CA 92521 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Health Policy Center Urban Institute 2100 M Street NW Washington, DC 20037; Department of Economics University of Illinois at Chicago Chicago, IL 60607"
The Effect of Public Insurance Expansions on Substance Use Disorder Treatment: Evidence from the Affordable Care Act,"Abstract We examine the effect of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on substance use disorder (SUD) treatment utilization and financing. We combine data on admissions to specialty facilities and Medicaid‐reimbursed prescriptions for medications commonly used to treat SUDs in nonspecialty outpatient settings with an event‐study design. Several findings emerge from our study. First, among patients receiving specialty care, Medicaid coverage and payments increased. Second, the share of patients who were uninsured and who had treatment paid for by state and local government payments declined. Third, private insurance coverage and payments increased. Fourth, expansion also increased prescriptions for SUD medications reimbursed by Medicaid. Fifth, we find suggestive evidence that admissions to specialty treatment may have increased one or more years post‐expansion. However, this finding is sensitive to specification and we observe differential pretrends between the treatment and comparison groups. Thus, our finding for admissions should be interpreted with caution.",Brendan Saloner; Johanna Catherine Maclean,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/pam.22112,"Medicaid, Specialty, Payment, Medical prescription, Private insurance, Family medicine, Government (linguistics), Medicine, Health insurance, Business, Actuarial science, Health care, Finance, Nursing, Economics, Economic growth, Linguistics, Philosophy",Temple University; Johns Hopkins University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Department of Economics Temple University Ritter Annex 869 Philadelphia, PA 19122 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Health Policy and Management Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health 624 N.

Health Insurance and Mortality: Experimental Evidence from Taxpayer Outreach,"Abstract We evaluate a randomized outreach study in which the IRS sent informational letters to 3.9 million households that paid a tax penalty for lacking health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Drawing on administrative data, we study the effect of this intervention on taxpayers’ subsequent health insurance enrollment and mortality. We find the intervention led to increased coverage during the subsequent two years and reduced mortality among middle-aged adults over the same time period.

The three-year impact of the Affordable Care Act on disparities in insurance coverage,"Objective To estimate the impact of the major components of the ACA (Medicaid expansion, subsidized Marketplace plans, and insurance market reforms) on disparities in insurance coverage after three years. Data Source The 2011‐2016 waves of the American Community Survey ( ACS ), with the sample restricted to nonelderly adults. Design We estimate a difference‐in‐difference‐in‐differences model to separately identify the effects of the nationwide and Medicaid expansion portions of the ACA using the methodology developed in the recent ACA literature. The differences come from time, state Medicaid expansion status, and local area pre‐ ACA uninsured rates. In order to focus on access disparities, we stratify our sample separately by income, race/ethnicity, marital status, age, gender, and geography. Principal Findings After three years, the fully implemented ACA eliminated 43% of the coverage gap across income groups, with the Medicaid expansion accounting for this entire reduction. The ACA also reduced coverage disparities across racial groups by 23%, across marital status by 46%, and across age‐groups by 36%, with these changes being partly attributable to both the Medicaid expansion and nationwide components of the law. Conclusions The fully implemented ACA has been successful in reducing coverage disparities across multiple groups.",Aaron Yelowitz; Benjamin Ukert; Charles Courtemanche; Daniela Zapata; Ishtiaque Fazlul; James Marton,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.13077,"Medicaid, Marital status, Ethnic group, Health insurance, Demography, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Subsidy, Socioeconomic status, Medicine, Sample (material), Health equity, Demographic economics, Geography, Health care, Environmental health, Political science, Population, Economic growth, Economics, Sociology, Chemistry, Chromatography, Law",University of Kentucky; Georgia State University; Impaq International (United States); National Bureau of Economic Research; Wilmington University; IZA - Institute of Labor Economics,"Department of Economics, Gatton College of Business and Economics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky; Healthcore Inc., Wilmington, Delaware; National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Institute of Labor Economics (IZA), Bonn, Germany; Department of Economics, Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia; Impaq International, Washington, District of Columbia; Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Department of Economics, Gatton College of Business and Economics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky; Healthcore Inc., Wilmington, Delaware; National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Institute of Labor Economics (IZA), Bonn, Germany; Department of Economics, Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia; Impaq International, Washington, District of Columbia; Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"
Effects of the Affordable Care Act on Health Care Access and Self-Assessed Health After 3 Years,"Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we examine the causal impact of the Affordable Care Act on health-related outcomes after 3 years. We estimate difference-in-difference-in-differences models that exploit variation in treatment intensity from 2 sources: (1) local area prereform uninsured rates from 2013 and (2) state participation in the Medicaid expansion. Including the third postreform year leads to 2 important insights. First, gains in health insurance coverage and access to care from the policy continued to increase in the third year. Second, an improvement in the probability of reporting excellent health emerged in the third year, with the effect being largely driven by the non-Medicaid expansions components of the policy.",Aaron Yelowitz; Benjamin Ukert; Charles Courtemanche; Daniela Zapata; James Marton,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1177/0046958018796361,"Medicaid, Health insurance, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Health care, Exploit, Difference in differences, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Environmental health, State policy, Business, Actuarial science, Demographic economics, Medicine, Economic growth, Political science, Policy analysis, Economics, Public administration, Econometrics, Population, Computer security, Computer science",Philadelphia University; University of Kentucky; Georgia State University; Impaq International (United States); National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA - Institute of Labor Economics; University of Pennsylvania,"IMPAQ International, LLC, Washington, DC, USA; Georgia State University, Atlanta, USA; University of Kentucky, Lexington, USA; National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA, USA; IZA–Institute of Labor Economics, Bonn, Germany; University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA","IMPAQ International, LLC, Washington, DC, USA; Georgia State University, Atlanta, USA; University of Kentucky, Lexington, USA; National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA, USA; IZA–Institute of Labor Economics, Bonn, Germany; University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA"
"THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT'S EFFECTS ON PATIENTS, PROVIDERS, AND THE ECONOMY: WHAT WE'VE LEARNED SO FAR","Abstract As we approach the tenth anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, it is important to reflect on what has been learned about the impacts of this major reform. In this paper, we review the literature on the impacts of the ACA on patients, providers, and the economy. We find strong evidence that the ACA's provisions have increased insurance coverage. There is also a clearly positive effect on access to and consumption of health care, with suggestive but more limited evidence on improved health outcomes. There is no evidence of significant reductions in provider access, changes in labor supply, or increased budgetary pressures on state governments, and the law's total federal cost through 2018 has been less than predicted. We conclude by describing key policy implications and future areas for research.",Benjamin D.

Governance Matters III: Governance Indicators for 1996–2002,"No AccessPolicy Research Working Papers21 Jun 2013Governance Matters III: Governance Indicators for 1996–2002Authors/Editors: Daniel Kaufmann, Aart Kraay, Massimo MastruzziDaniel Kaufmann, Aart Kraay, Massimo Mastruzzihttps://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-3106SectionsAboutPDF (0.6 MB) ToolsAdd to favoritesDownload CitationsTrack Citations ShareFacebookTwitterLinked In Abstract:Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi present estimates of six dimensions of governance covering 199 countries and territories for four time periods: 1996, 1998, 2000, and 2002. These indicators are based on several hundred individual variables measuring perceptions of governance, drawn from 25 separate data sources constructed by 18 different organizations. The authors assign these individual measures of governance to categories capturing key dimensions of governance and use an unobserved components model to construct six aggregate governance indicators in each of the four periods. They present the point estimates of the dimensions of governance as well as the margins of errors for each country for the four periods. The governance indicators reported here are an update and expansion of previous research work on indicators initiated in 1998 (Kaufmann, Kraay, and Zoido-Lobatón 1999a, b and 2002). The authors also address various methodological issues, including the interpretation and use of the data given the estimated margins of errors. This paper—a joint product of the Global Governance Department, World Bank Institute, and Macroeconomics and Growth, Development Research Group—is part of a larger effort in the Bank to generate and analyze worldwide governance indicators, and to assess the causes and consequences of governance.

The Protective Role of Medicaid Expansion for Low‐Income People During the <scp>COVID</scp>‐19 Pandemic,"During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly 47.5 million Americans lost their employer-sponsored health insurance. While many were able to transition to plans from other family members, 56% became uninsured [1]—a deleterious result during the height of a pandemic. Lower-income workers are most likely to be laid off and lose coverage during economic downturns, exacerbating socioeconomic disparities in healthcare access [2, 3]. Medicaid served as an essential lifeline for individuals and families during the pandemic, and enrollment rose steadily throughout 2020, especially in states that expanded Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) [4]. While health and income losses during the pandemic were widespread, a growing body of literature demonstrates that residents of Medicaid expansion states suffered less than their non-expansion peers. Thus, Medicaid may provide important protective benefits and increase the resiliency of our health system. This commentary synthesizes the growing literature that examines the impacts of Medicaid expansion on low-income individuals during the pandemic. Many studies have found that state investments in public health, particularly through Medicaid expansion, helped protect low-income individuals from some of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We begin by describing the landscape of Medicaid policy at the onset of the pandemic. We then provide a synopsis of the emerging body of literature that studies the effects of Medicaid expansion during the pandemic. We conclude by discussing challenges and opportunities for Medicaid expansion as a vehicle to protect low-income people during future public health emergencies. President Donald J. Trump declared the COVID-19 pandemic a nationwide emergency on March 13th, 2020 [5]. By this date, 35 states and the District of Columbia had expanded Medicaid under the ACA [6]. A voluminous literature generally demonstrates that, compared to non-expanders, residents of Medicaid expansion states experienced better access to care [7-9] and improved health outcomes [10-13] during the pre-pandemic period and that these benefits disproportionately accrued to low-income or minoritized populations [14-16]. When the pandemic struck, the Medicaid program stood ready to fill an essential role protecting low-income individuals and essential workers, who were most susceptible to the pandemic's adverse effects. Expansion states were better positioned to take advantage of federal policy changes that were implemented to strengthen Medicaid, such as the Families First Coronavirus Response Act of 2020 (FFCRA). As part of the FFCRA, all state Medicaid programs adopted maintenance of eligibility and continuous coverage provisions that essentially prohibited states from terminating most enrollees' coverage until after the end of the public health emergency. However, these provisions were expected to increase mandatory spending during an especially challenging time for state budgets due to declining income and sales tax revenues. The FFCRA provided states with an additional 6.2 percentage point increase in federal matching assistance percentage (FMAP) to offset these costs (from a baseline FMAP range of 56.20% to 83.18% across states). The continuous coverage provision was associated with unprecedented increases in Medicaid enrollment, reducing churn and access disruptions among enrollees. Between February 2020 and January 2023, enrollment increased more than 30% or 21 million people nationwide [17]. As we describe below, residents of Medicaid expansion states benefitted most from the FFCRA during the pandemic. A surge of new research is shedding light on the crucial role Medicaid expansions under the ACA had during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for low-income Americans. Studies using quasi-experimental research designs show that compared to non-expansion states, Medicaid expansions improved access to care and boosted health outcomes for low-income populations. The key results of 11 such studies are summarized in Table 1. We restricted our focus to studies that examined the effects of state Medicaid expansions during the pandemic and employed rigorous quasi-experimental designs. Most of these studies applied either regression discontinuity or difference-in-differences approaches to compare outcomes in states that did and did not expand Medicaid, before and after the onset of the COVID-19 public health emergency. We excluded descriptive or cross-sectional studies from our summary. The first set of studies looked at the association between Medicaid expansions and rates of insurance coverage during the pandemic. There are several reasons to expect insurance rates in expansion and non-expansion states to diverge after March 2020, when the pandemic and its associated recession caused widespread job loss. In Medicaid expansion states, workers who lost jobs and income during the pandemic became eligible for Medicaid at higher income thresholds. Moreover, expansion states were better positioned to leverage federal policy changes such as the FFCRA because a larger proportion of their low-income adult populations were already eligible for or covered by Medicaid. Indeed, empirical studies found that Medicaid expansion protected low-income populations from a rise in uninsurance during the pandemic. One of the earliest studies published in this space, Khorrami and Sommers (2021), used state-level data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to compare changes in Medicaid enrollment between 2019 and 2020 in expansion versus non-expansion states. The authors found that expansion status was associated with higher Medicaid enrollment growth in the early months of the pandemic [4]. Subsequent studies used survey data to examine changes in insurance coverage. For example, Auty et al. (2023) studied data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and found uninsurance decreased for all racial and income groups in expansion states. Furthermore, these decreases were concentrated among Black, multiracial, and low-income adults [18]. Figueroa et al. (2021) surveyed low-income, working-age adults in four southern states and found that the expansions were associated with reductions in uninsurance among Black and Latinx individuals [19]. Elani et al. (2023) found that the combination of Medicaid expansion with coverage of adult dental benefits improved access to dental care [20]. We are aware of two studies that specifically examined churning between different sources of coverage. Benitez (2022) used CPS data to study a sample of working-age adults who were employed before the pandemic and found that the expansions were associated with an increase in unemployment-related Medicaid enrollment and greater probability of being able to transition from employer insurance to Medicaid [21]. Jacobs & Moriya (2023) used Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) panel data on non-elderly people and found that the expansions were associated with increased shifts from uninsurance to Medicaid after the onset of the pandemic [22]. For the most part, the empirical literature has found little effect of the Medicaid expansions on financial barriers to care during the pandemic [18, 19]. Figueroa et al. (2021) argued the growing burden of nonfinancial barriers may be to blame [19]; many Americans avoided care voluntarily due to fear of COVID-19 infection or involuntary cancelation of elective procedures by hospitals and providers [23]. Auty et al. (2023) echoed this concern and argued that measurement issues with the BRFSS may be to blame; given widespread fear of infection and cancellation of elective procedures, survey respondents may no longer identify cost as the most salient reason for foregone care [18]. While this commentary focuses on quasi-experimental studies, we note that several other studies used post-pandemic data only to compare access to care in expansion and non-expansion states and found promising evidence that Medicaid expansion benefited low-income populations during the pandemic. This research found that the steep declines in insurance coverage at the beginning of the pandemic were concentrated in non-expansion states [24] and that expansion states experienced increasing rates of both employment and public insurance coverage as the pandemic unfolded [25]. Moreover, relative to their counterparts in non-expansion states, people in Medicaid expansion states who experienced COVID-linked job loss were less likely to be uninsured, more likely to have Medicaid, less likely to have unpaid medical bills, and less likely to have calls from debt collection agencies [21, 26, 27]. These findings complement the quasi-experimental literature summarized above and point to the potential of Medicaid expansion to insulate low-income households from the diminished healthcare access and financial distress that comes in times of public health crises. Much has been written about the sharp contraction in health services utilization following the pandemic's onset, although there is a dearth of literature comparing expansion and non-expansion states. Marinacci et al. (2023) looked at cardiovascular-related screenings and management and found expansion increased diabetes screening rates. However, there were no effects on other health-promoting behaviors such as cholesterol testing, hypertension treatment, insulin utilization, or receipt of diabetes-related care [28]. Avtar et al. (2022) compared counties by expansion status using a regression discontinuity design. Counties in expansion states experienced higher rates of COVID-19 testing, similar rates of physician office visits and hospital bed utilization, and lower rates of intensive care unit (ICU) bed utilization [29]. A lack of appointment availability during the public health emergency may have blunted the potential positive effects of Medicaid effects on health services utilization [23]. Overall, Americans reported increased sleep hours, higher rates of exercise participation, greater alcohol consumption, and lower rates of smoking during the pandemic [30]. Health insurance coverage, including Medicaid, may reduce enrollees' allostatic load and facilitate greater investments in self-care and health-promoting behaviors. Unfortunately, we located only one study that compared changes in health-related behaviors between states that did and did not expand Medicaid. Rakus and Soni (2022) analyzed BRFSS data and found that expansions were associated with lower rates of smoking and heavy drinking and higher flu vaccination rates during the pandemic [31]. However, this study found no correlation between state expansion status and exercise participation rates or obesity. Further research is needed to determine whether differences in health-related behaviors contributed to the variation in outcomes between states that expanded Medicaid and those that did not. More than 1.2 million Americans died due to COVID-19 as of September 2024 [32]. Compared to non-expanders, expansion states had higher insurance rates, and their residents were more likely to report a usual source of care before the pandemic struck. There is reason to believe they were more likely to receive and follow health-promoting information from primary care physicians via telehealth, reduce unnecessary exposure in waiting rooms, and thus have better health outcomes during the pandemic. Moreover, by improving adults' baseline health before the pandemic, Medicaid expansion may have reduced the likelihood of unmanaged health conditions, making serious illness and death from COVID-19 less likely in expansion states. Compared to the pre-pandemic period, Americans reported better physical health and similar mental health during 2020 [30]. The empirical literature on Medicaid expansion and pandemic-related health outcomes is mixed. Rakus and Soni (2022) found that expansions were associated with improvements in self-assessed physical health but had no effect on mental health for low-income adults [31]. A subsequent study by Oyeka and Wehby (2023) found that for certain subgroups of low-income people, such as adults younger than 45, women, and some racial minorities, Medicaid expansion was associated with better mental health during the pandemic [33]. Auty and Griffith (2022) found that while drug and opioid overdose death rates increased rapidly during the pandemic, these changes were not related to state Medicaid expansion [34]. Avtar et al. (2022) presented data on county-level COVID-19 cases and deaths and compared COVID-19 outcomes in bordering counties across expansion and non-expansion states. They found no effect of Medicaid expansion for either the overall population or various age, race, and ethnic subgroups [29]. The literature reviewed in this commentary underscores Medicaid expansion's critical role during the COVID-19 pandemic but has limitations. Unlike pre-pandemic studies, these analyses cannot leverage states' staggered Medicaid adoption decisions to control for potential confounding factors. Instead, this work relies on pre- and post-pandemic comparisons in expansion versus non-expansion states, making it harder to isolate the effects of Medicaid expansion from other correlated policies. Although most studies control for pandemic-related policies like mask mandates and stay-at-home orders, expansion states may have also implemented additional pre-pandemic safety net benefits. These could include more generous unemployment insurance, higher minimum wages, expanded housing assistance programs, or robust food assistance initiatives like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) enhancements. These correlated benefits complicate efforts to isolate the specific effects of Medicaid expansion during the pandemic. Additionally, the continuous coverage provision confounds analyses by making it challenging to disentangle the specific effects of Medicaid expansion from the broader impacts of this universal policy. Both may have contributed to increased access to care and financial stability for low-income populations during the pandemic, but their intertwined effects obscure a clear understanding of Medicaid expansion's unique role. Additionally, most studies used data from 2020 to 2021 due to lags in availability, despite the public health emergency extending into 2023. Surveys collected early in the pandemic faced challenges like low response rates and potential non-response bias, although post-stratification weighting may ameliorate some of these issues. More research is needed to evaluate Medicaid expansion's role across the full pandemic, particularly for outcomes like COVID-19 morbidity, mortality, and prevention. A growing literature, summarized above, suggests that Medicaid expansion was associated with increased insurance coverage, improved access to care, improved some health-related behaviors, and eased financial strain among low-income people during the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed during the pandemic that reliance on employer-sponsored insurance makes us less resilient during times of economic downturn. Nearly 14.6 million workers and their dependents lost employer-sponsored insurance coverage during the first four months of the COVID-19 public health emergency [35]. By ensuring the health and protection of low-income populations, Medicaid expansion can help offset losses during public health emergencies and economic downturns. However, a lack of public awareness may have diminished Medicaid's effectiveness. Survey evidence suggests that millions of enrollees were unaware their coverage was maintained during the pandemic and mistakenly self-identified as uninsured [36]. States may not have effectively communicated that individuals were automatically retained on Medicaid during the pandemic, and many beneficiaries misunderstood the continuous coverage provision or its impact on their eligibility. This ""Medicaid undercount"" weakens the program's ability to improve access, increase health services utilization, and enhance health outcomes [37]. Despite these benefits, the Medicaid program faces several challenges ahead. First, there has been a surge in disenrollment starting in 2023. Over 25 million people lost their Medicaid coverage since the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency, as states resume the pre-pandemic process of periodically redetermining eligibility for Medicaid [38]. A survey found that roughly half of those who lost Medicaid coverage became uninsured, and even those who moved to new insurance experienced coverage gaps and reported challenges accessing care [39]. Additionally, not all states expanded Medicaid to cover their low-income populations. Five states expanded during the pandemic including Nebraska, Oklahoma, Missouri, South Dakota, and North Carolina. The remaining 10 holdout states lack feasible options for expansion via executive order or ballot initiative; endorsement from their state legislatures is paramount. The next administration should support creative Section 1115 waivers that encourage the remaining non-expansion states to adopt Medicaid in ways that work for them. For instance, Arkansas received approval for a market-based approach, allowing Medicaid enrollees to buy private health plans through the state's individual insurance exchange. Providing states with similar flexibility and incentives could expand Medicaid in the remaining 10 states, benefiting low-income populations and strengthening our resilience in future public health emergencies and recessions. Significant gaps in our understanding of Medicaid expansion's protective effects remain, and future research must address these to provide a clearer picture. Researchers need to disentangle the effects of Medicaid expansion from other public program benefits and the continuous coverage provision by leveraging detailed policy variation across states and over time. Comparative studies that incorporate granular data on state-level policy generosity and timing, as well as natural experiments or simulation models, could help isolate the distinct contributions of Medicaid expansion. Current studies relying on 2020 and 2021 data offer valuable insights into the immediate impacts during the pandemic, but longer term analyses are crucial as more recent data become available. These studies will be essential to fully understanding how Medicaid expansion's effects evolved, particularly as pandemic era policies like the continuous coverage provision phase out and states adapt their public programs. The human cost of COVID-19 has been enormous, and the pandemic's economic fallout sharply reduced access to care as layoffs ended employer-sponsored health insurance. These pains were disproportionately experienced by low-income individuals and their families. A growing empirical literature suggests that enhanced access to Medicaid offset some of the negative financial and health impacts. Holdout states should view Medicaid expansion as a way to strengthen health system resilience, safeguard low-income populations, and reduce the risk of worsening socioeconomic disparities in future pandemics.

Investing in Infants: the Lasting Effects of Cash Transfers to New Families,"Abstract We provide new evidence that cash transfers following the birth of a first child can have large and long-lasting effects on that child’s outcomes. We take advantage of the January 1 birthdate cutoff for U.S. child-related tax benefits, which results in families of otherwise similar children receiving substantially different refunds during the first year of life. For the average low-income single-child family in our sample, this difference amounts to roughly ${\$}$1,300, or 10% of income. Using the universe of administrative federal tax data in selected years, we show that this transfer in infancy increases young adult earnings by at least 1%–2%, with larger effects for males. These effects show up at earlier ages in terms of improved math and reading test scores and a higher likelihood of high-school graduation. The observed effects on shorter-run parental outcomes suggest that additional liquidity during the critical window following the birth of a first child leads to persistent increases in family income that likely contribute to the downstream effects on children’s outcomes. The longer-term effects on child earnings alone are large enough that the transfer pays for itself through subsequent increases in federal income tax revenue.",Alexander A Smith; Alexander A.

The Impacts of Paid Family Leave Benefits: Regression Kink Evidence from California Administrative Data,"Abstract We use 10 years of California administrative data with a regression kink design to estimate the causal impacts of benefits in the first state‐level paid family leave program for women with earnings near the maximum benefit threshold. We find no evidence that a higher weekly benefit amount (WBA) increases leave duration or leads to adverse future labor market outcomes for this group. In contrast, we document that a rise in the WBA leads to an increased likelihood of returning to the pre‐leave firm (conditional on any employment) and of making a subsequent paid family leave claim.",Kelly Bedard; Maya Rossin‐Slater; Sarah Bana; Sarah H.

Child Tax Benefits and Labor Supply: Evidence from California,"The largest tax-based social welfare programs in the US limit their benefits to taxpayers with labor market income.Eliminating these work requirements would better target transfers to the neediest families but risks attenuating tax-based incentives to work.We study changes in labor force participation from the elimination of a work requirement in a tax credit for parents of young children, drawing on quasi-random variation in birth timing and administrative tax records.To do so, we develop and implement a novel approach for selecting an empirical specification to maximize the precision of our estimate.The unique design of the policy along with its subsequent reform allow us to isolate taxpayers' sensitivity to conditioning child tax benefits on work --the parameter at the center of recent debates about the labor supply consequences of reforming federal tax policy for children.We estimate that eliminating the work requirement causes very few mothers to exit the labor force, with a 95% confidence interval excluding labor supply reductions of one-third of a percentage point or greater.Our results suggest expanding tax benefits for low-income children need not meaningfully reduce labor force participation.",Ithai Lurie; Ithai Z.

Microeconomic Evidence of Creative Destruction in Industrial and Developing Countries,"No AccessPolicy Research Working Papers21 Jun 2013Microeconomic Evidence of Creative Destruction in Industrial and Developing CountriesAuthors/Editors: John C. Haltiwanger, Eric Bartelsman, Stefano ScarpettaJohn C. Haltiwanger, Eric Bartelsman, Stefano Scarpettahttps://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-3464SectionsAboutPDF (1 MB) ToolsAdd to favoritesDownload CitationsTrack Citations ShareFacebookTwitterLinked In Abstract:Bartelsman, Haltiwanger, and Scarpetta provide an analysis of the process of creative destruction across 24 countries and 2-digit industries over the past decade. They rely on a newly assembled dataset that draws from different micro data sources (business registers, census, or representative enterprise surveys). The novelty of their approach is in the harmonization of firm-level data across countries, which enables international comparisons and the identification of country-specific factors as opposed to sector and time effects. All countries display a massive reallocation of resources, with the entry and exit of many firms in all markets, the failure of many newcomers, and the expansion of successful ones. This process of creative destruction affects productivity directly by reallocating resources toward more productive uses, but also indirectly through the effects of increased market contestability. There are also large differences across groups of countries. While entry and exit rates are fairly similar across industrial countries, post-entry performance differs markedly between Europe and the United States, a potential indication of the importance of barriers to firm growth as opposed to barriers to entry. Transition economies show an even more impressive process of creative destruction and those that have progressed the most toward a market economy show better outcomes from this process. Finally, Mexico shows large firm dynamics with many new firms entering the battle but also many failing rapidly, while Argentina resembles Continental Europe with smaller flows and less impressive post-entry growth of successful firms. This paper—a product of the Social Protection Team, Human Development Network—is part of a larger effort in the network to understand the process of creative destruction.

"Capabilities, Wealth, and Trade","We explore the relation between a country's income and the mix of products it exports. Both are simultaneously determined by countries' capabilities, that is, by countries' productivity and quality levels for each good. Our theoretical setup has two features. (1) Some goods have fewer high-quality producers/countries than others, meaning that there is comparative advantage. (2) Imperfect competition allows high- and low-quality producers to coexist. These two features generate an inverted-U, general equilibrium relationship between a country's export mix and its GDP per capita. We show that this inverted-U permeates the international data on trade and GDP per capita.",Daniel Trefler; John Sutton,,,,,,,,,,,,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.1086/686034,"Economics, Quality (philosophy), Productivity, Per capita, Imperfect competition, Comparative advantage, Per capita income, Competition (biology), International economics, Imperfect, General equilibrium theory, International trade, Macroeconomics, Microeconomics, Population, Ecology, Philosophy, Linguistics, Demography, Epistemology, Sociology, Biology",Canadian Institute for Advanced Research; London School of Economics and Political Science; National Bureau of Economic Research,"University of Toronto, Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, and National Bureau of Economic Research; London School of Economics","University of Toronto, Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, and National Bureau of Economic Research; London School of Economics"
Firm Heterogeneity in Consumption Baskets: Evidence from Home and Store Scanner Data,"Abstract A growing literature has documented the role of firm heterogeneity within sectors for nominal income inequality. This article explores the implications for household price indices across the income distribution. Using detailed matched U.S. home and store scanner microdata, we present evidence that rich and poor households source their consumption differently across the firm size distribution within disaggregated product groups. We use the data to examine alternative explanations, propose a tractable quantitative model with two-sided heterogeneity that rationalizes the observed moments, and calibrate it to explore general equilibrium counterfactuals. We find that larger, more productive firms sort into catering to the taste of richer households, and that this gives rise to asymmetric effects on household price indices. We quantify these effects in the context of policy counterfactuals that affect the distribution of disposable incomes on the demand side or profits across firms on the supply side.",Benjamin Faber; Thibault Fally,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdab061,"Microdata (statistics), Economics, Consumption (sociology), Counterfactual conditional, Econometrics, Distribution (mathematics), Context (archaeology), Inequality, Microeconomics, Counterfactual thinking, Social science, Population, Philosophy, Mathematical analysis, Demography, Mathematics, Paleontology, Epistemology, Sociology, Census, Biology","University of California, Berkeley","Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, UC Berkeley and NBER; Department of Economics, UC Berkeley and NBER","Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, UC Berkeley and NBER; Department of Economics, UC Berkeley and NBER"

"Corruption, Norms, and Legal Enforcement: Evidence from Diplomatic Parking Tickets","We study cultural norms and legal enforcement in controlling corruption by analyzing the parking behavior of United Nations officials in Manhattan. Until 2002, diplomatic immunity protected UN diplomats from parking enforcement actions, so diplomats’ actions were constrained by cultural norms alone. We find a strong effect of corruption norms: diplomats from high‐corruption countries (on the basis of existing survey‐based indices) accumulated significantly more unpaid parking violations. In 2002, enforcement authorities acquired the right to confiscate diplomatic license plates of violators. Unpaid violations dropped sharply in response. Cultural norms and (particularly in this context) legal enforcement are both important determinants of corruption.",Edward Miguel; Raymond Fisman,,,,,,,,,,,,2007.0,https://doi.org/10.1086/527495,"Enforcement, License, Context (archaeology), Language change, Business, Law enforcement, Political science, Law, Geography, Art, Literature, Archaeology","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Berkeley","University of California, Berkeley and National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University and National Bureau of Economic Research","University of California, Berkeley and National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University and National Bureau of Economic Research"

Banking Stability Measures,"This Working Paper should not be reported as representing the views of the IMF.The views expressed in this Working Paper are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent those of the IMF or IMF policy.Working Papers describe research in progress by the author(s) and are published to elicit comments and to further debate.This paper defines a set of banking stability measures which take account of distress dependence among the banks in a system, thereby providing a set of tools to analyze stability from complementary perspectives by allowing the measurement of (i) common distress of the banks in a system, (ii) distress between specific banks, and (iii) distress in the system associated with a specific bank.Our approach defines the banking system as a portfolio of banks and infers the system's multivariate density (BSMD) from which the proposed measures are estimated.The BSMD embeds the banks' default inter-dependence structure that captures linear and non-linear distress dependencies among the banks in the system, and its changes at different times of the economic cycle.The BSMD is recovered using the CIMDO-approach, a new approach that in the presence of restricted data, improves density specification without explicitly imposing parametric forms that, under restricted data sets, are difficult to model.Thus, the proposed measures can be constructed from a very limited set of publicly available data and can be provided for a wide range of both developing and developed countries.",C.

"To Find Relative Earnings Gains After the China Shock, Look Outside Manufacturing and Upstream","We examine US workers' employment and earnings before and after trade liberalization with China.Among workers initially employed in manufacturing, we find substantial and persistent declines in both outcomes, with indirect exposure via input-output linkages exacerbating the negative effects of direct exposure.For workers initially employed outside manufacturing, however, we find that the positive impact of greater upstream exposure via inputs more than offsets the adverse impacts of own-and downstream exposure, inducing relative earnings gains.We also find that spatial exposure is more influential than industry exposure.",Cristina Tello-Trillo; Justin Pierce; Justin R.

Toward understanding the impact of artificial intelligence on labor,"Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation technologies have the potential to significantly disrupt labor markets. While AI and automation can augment the productivity of some workers, they can replace the work done by others and will likely transform almost all occupations at least to some degree. Rising automation is happening in a period of growing economic inequality, raising fears of mass technological unemployment and a renewed call for policy efforts to address the consequences of technological change. In this paper we discuss the barriers that inhibit scientists from measuring the effects of AI and automation on the future of work. These barriers include the lack of high-quality data about the nature of work (e.g., the dynamic requirements of occupations), lack of empirically informed models of key microlevel processes (e.g., skill substitution and human-machine complementarity), and insufficient understanding of how cognitive technologies interact with broader economic dynamics and institutional mechanisms (e.g., urban migration and international trade policy). Overcoming these barriers requires improvements in the longitudinal and spatial resolution of data, as well as refinements to data on workplace skills. These improvements will enable multidisciplinary research to quantitatively monitor and predict the complex evolution of work in tandem with technological progress. Finally, given the fundamental uncertainty in predicting technological change, we recommend developing a decision framework that focuses on resilience to unexpected scenarios in addition to general equilibrium behavior.",Dashun Wang; David Autor; David Deming; David J.

On young highly innovative companies: why they matter and how (not) to policy support them,"Recent policy initiatives in the EU aim at supporting so-called young highly innovative companies (YICs). This article provides empirical evidence from German CIS data on the innovative performances of this specific type of firms, supporting why they matter. We first characterize YICs in the sample of innovation active firms. We show that firms that combine newness, smallness, and high R&D intensity are rare in the sample of innovative firms, but achieve significantly higher innovative sales than other innovative firms, especially innovative sales that are new to the market. Not surprisingly, YICs view financial constraints, both internal and external, as an important factor hampering their innovation activities, significantly more so than other innovation active firms. This access to finance problem is an often used motive for government intervention. On the effectiveness of subsidies, our results suggest that the subsidy allocation mechanisms at place in Germany during the sample period are not associated with relatively higher innovative performance of the subsidized YICs as compared to other recipients.",C.

Bill of lading data in international trade research with an application to the COVID‐19 pandemic,"Abstract We evaluate high‐frequency bill of lading data for international trade research. These data offer some advantages over both other publicly accessible trade data and confidential datasets, but they also have drawbacks. We analyze three aspects of trade during the COVID‐19 pandemic. First, we show how the high‐frequency data capture the within‐month collapse of trade between the United States and India that are not observable in official monthly data.

"Rising Import Tariffs, Falling Export Growth: When Modern Supply Chains Meet Old-Style Protectionism","We examine the impacts of the 2018-2019 U.S. import tariff increases on U.S. export growth through the lens of supply chain linkages.Using 2016 confidential firm-trade linked data, we identify firms that eventually faced tariff increases.They accounted for 84% of all exports and represented 65% of manufacturing employment.For the average affected firm, the implied cost is $900 per worker in new duties.We construct product-level measures of exporters' exposure to import tariff increases and estimate the impact on U.S. export growth.The most exposed products had relatively lower export growth in 2018-2019, with larger effects in 2019.The decline in export growth in 2019Q3, for example, is equivalent to an ad valorem tariff on U.S. exports of 2% for the typical product and up to 4% for products with higher than average exposure.",Fariha Kamal; Kyle Handley; Ryan Monarch,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w26611,"Protectionism, Falling (accident), International trade, Supply chain, International economics, Style (visual arts), Business, Economics, Geography, Marketing, Medicine, Environmental health, Archaeology",Stanford University; University of Virginia; University of Michigan–Ann Arbor; Georgetown University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve Board of Governors; Ross School; George Washington University; United States Census Bureau,"NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Ross School of Business University of Michigan 701 Tappan Street Ann Arbor, MI 48109 and; University of Virginia, Georgetown University, George Washington University,; U.S. Bureau of the Census 4600 Silver Hill Road Washington, D.C 20233; International Finance Division Federal Reserve Board of Governors 20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W.

What Businesses Attract Unions? Unionization over the Life Cycle of U.S. Establishments,"What types of businesses attract unions? The study develops a theory of union learning and organizing to provide an answer to this question. A union monitors the productivity of establishments in an industry and uses this information to decide which ones to organize. An establishment becomes unionized if the union wins a certification election, the outcome of which can be influenced by costly actions taken by the two parties. The model offers predictions on the nature of union selection, which are examined empirically. Data on union certification elections, matched with data on establishment characteristics, are used to explore where union activity is concentrated.",Emin Dinlersoz; Henry Hyatt; Henry R.

Who Do Unions Target? Unionization Over the Life-Cycle of U.S. Businesses,"What type of businesses do unions target for organizing? A dynamic model of the union organizing process is constructed to answer this question. A union monitors establishments in an industry to learn about their productivity and decides which ones to organize and when. An establishment becomes unionized if the union targets it for organizing and wins the union certification election. The model predicts two main selection effects: unions secure elections in larger and more productive establishments early in their life-cycles, and among the establishments that experience an election, unions are more likely to win in smaller and less productive ones. These predictions find support in union certification election data for 1977-2007 matched with data on establishment characteristics.

General Equilibrium Effects of Insurance Expansions: Evidence from Long-Term Care Labor Markets,"Arrow (1963) hypothesized that demand-side moral hazard induced by health insurance leads to supply-side expansions in healthcare markets. Capturing these effects empirically has been challenging, as non-marginal insurance expansions are rare and detailed data on healthcare labor and capital is sparse. We combine administrative labor market data with the geographic variation in the rollout of a universal insurance program—the introduction of long-term care (LTC) insurance in Germany in 1995—to document a substantial expansion of the inpatient LTC labor market in response to insurance expansion. A 10 percentage point expansion in the share of insured elderly leads to 0.05 (7%) more inpatient LTC firms and four (13%) more workers per 1,000 elderly in Germany. Wages did not rise, but the quality of newly hired workers declined. We find suggestive evidence of a reduction in old-age mortality. Using a machine learning algorithm, we characterize counterfactual labor market biographies of potential inpatient LTC hires, finding that the reform moved workers into LTC jobs from unemployment and out of the labor force rather than from other sectors of the economy. We estimate that employing these additional workers in LTC is socially efficient if patients value the care provided by these workers at least at 25% of the market price for care. We show conceptually that, in the spirit of Harberger (1971), in a second-best equilibrium in which supply-side labor markets do not clear at perfectly competitive wages, subsidies for healthcare consumption along with the associated demand-side moral hazard can be welfare-enhancing.",Holger Siebert; Joerg Heining; Maria Polyakova; Martin B.

Wages and Human Capital in the U.S. Financial Industry: 1909-2006,"We use detailed information about wages, education and occupations to shed light on the evolution of the U.S. financial sector over the past century.We uncover a set of new, interrelated stylized facts: financial jobs were relatively skill intensive, complex, and highly paid until the 1930s and after the 1980s, but not in the interim period.We investigate the determinants of this evolution and find that financial deregulation and corporate activities linked to IPOs and credit risk increase the demand for skills in financial jobs.Computers and information technology play a more limited role.Our analysis also shows that wages in finance were excessively high around 1930 and from the mid 1990s until 2006.For the recent period we estimate that rents accounted for 30% to 50% of the wage differential between the financial sector and the rest of the private sector.",Ariell Reshef; Thomas Philippon,,,,,,,,,,,,2009.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w14644,"Stylized fact, Wage, Economic rent, Labour economics, Economics, Interim, Finance, Financial sector, Private sector, Financial system, Business, Market economy, Macroeconomics, History, Archaeology, Economic growth",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique; University of Virginia; Paris School of Economics; National Bureau of Economic Research; New York University,"University of Virginia (P.O.

Labor in the Boardroom,"Abstract We estimate the wage effects of shared governance, or codetermination, in the form of a mandate of one-third of corporate board seats going to worker representatives. We study a reform in Germany that abruptly abolished this mandate for stock corporations incorporated after August 1994, while it locked the mandate for the slightly older cohorts. Our research design compares firm cohorts incorporated before the reform and after; in a robustness check we draw on the analogous difference in unaffected firm types (LLCs). We find no effects of board-level codetermination on wages and the wage structure, even in firms with particularly flexible wages. The degree of rent sharing and the labor share are also unaffected. We reject that disinvestment could have offset wage effects through the canonical hold-up channel, as shared governance, if anything, increases capital formation.",Benjamin Schoefer; Jörg Heining; Simon Jäger,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjaa038,"Mandate, Wage, Corporate governance, Labour economics, Shareholder, Economics, Robustness (evolution), Business, Finance, Political science, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Law, Gene","Institut für Arbeitsmarkt und Berufsforschung; University of California, Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology","University of California, Berkeley, United States; Massachusetts Institute of Technology and National Bureau of Economic Research, United States; Institute for Employment Research (IAB), Germany","University of California, Berkeley, United States; Massachusetts Institute of Technology and National Bureau of Economic Research, United States; Institute for Employment Research (IAB), Germany"
What Does Codetermination Do?,"The authors provide a comprehensive overview of codetermination, that is, worker representation in firms’ governance and management. The available micro evidence points to zero or small positive effects of codetermination on worker and firm outcomes and leaves room for moderate positive effects on productivity, wages, and job stability. The authors also present new country-level, general-equilibrium event studies of codetermination reforms between the 1960s and 2010s, finding no effects on aggregate economic outcomes or the quality of industrial relations. They offer three explanations for the institution’s limited impact. First, existing codetermination laws convey little authority to workers. Second, countries with codetermination laws have high baseline levels of informal worker voice. Third, codetermination laws may interact with other labor market institutions, such as union representation and collective bargaining. The article closes with a discussion of the implications for recent codetermination proposals in the United States.",Benjamin Schoefer; Shakked Noy; Simon Jäger,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1177/00197939211065727,"Collective bargaining, Productivity, Industrial relations, Representation (politics), Institution, Corporate governance, Quality (philosophy), Economics, Business, Labour economics, Political science, Law, Economic growth, Finance, Management, Philosophy, Epistemology, Politics","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Berkeley","Simon Jäger is an Assistant Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a Research Fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).

"Unions, wages and hours","We examine union-non-union differentials in wages and hours in the United States over the last 50 years using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS).The regression-adjusted difference between union members' and non-members' hourly earnings has been falling since the Great Recession.The union differential in weekly wages has been more stable.Although it fell by around 5 log points during COVID it remains 15 log points.This weekly earnings differential arises from both a higher hourly wage of around 10 log points and longer working hours (5 log points).The working hours differential partly reflects unions' ability to tackle underemployment, such that union workers work closer to the hours they desire than their non-union counterparts.The traditional focus on hourly wage differentials underplays the important role trade unions play in maintaining members' weekly earnings by ensuring workers receive the paid hours they desire.",Alex Bryson; David Blanchflower; David G.

From the Fringe to the Fore: Labor Unions and Employee Compensation,"Conventional wisdom suggests that labor unions raise worker wages, while the newer empirical literature finds only negligible earnings effects. I reconcile this apparent contradiction by arguing that collective bargaining targets fringe benefits. Using U.S. firm-level data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Multinational Enterprise Survey and Compustat, I exploit a regression discontinuity in majority rule union elections to compare changes in employee compensation at firms whose establishment barely won a union election against those that barely lost an election.

Corporate Taxes and Union Wages in the United States,"This paper evaluates the effect of U.S. state corporate income taxes on union wages.American workers who belong to unions are paid more than their non-union counterparts, and this difference is greater in low-tax locations, reflecting that unions and employers share tax savings associated with low tax rates.In 2000 the difference between average union and non-union hourly wages was $1.88 greater in states with corporate tax rates below four percent than in states with tax rates of nine percent and above.Controlling for observable worker characteristics, a one percent lower state tax rate is associated with a 0.36 percent higher union wage premium, suggesting that workers in a fully unionized firm capture roughly 54 percent of the benefits of low tax rates.",James Hines; James R.

Earnings Inequality and Mobility Trends in the United States: Nationally Representative Estimates from Longitudinally Linked Employer-Employee Data,"Decomposing the year-to-year changes in the earnings distribution from 2004 to 2013, we analyze the role of the employer in explaining earnings inequality in the United States. Movements between the bottom, middle, and top involve 20.5 million workers each year. Another 19.9 million move between employment and nonemployment. There are large gains from working at a top-paying firm for all skill types. Working for a high-paying firm produces benefits today, through higher earnings, that persist through an increase in the probability of upward mobility. High-paying firms facilitate moving workers to the top of the distribution and keeping them there.",John M. Abowd; Kevin L. McKinney; Nellie L.

How Reliable are Administrative Reports of Paid Work Hours?,"This paper examines the quality of quarterly records on work hours collected from employers in the State of Washington to administer the unemployment insurance (UI) system, specifically to determine eligibility for UI. We subject the administrative records to four “trials,” all of which suggest the records reliably measure paid hours of work. First, distributions of hours in the administrative records and Current Population Survey outgoing rotation groups (CPS) both suggest that 52–54% of workers work approximately 40 hours per week. Second, in the administrative records, quarter-to-quarter changes in the log of earnings are highly correlated with quarter-to-quarter changes in the log of paid hours. Third, annual changes in Washington’s minimum wage rate (which is indexed) are clearly reflected in year-to-year changes in the distribution of paid hours in the administrative data.

Who Moves Up the Job Ladder?,"In this paper, we use linked employer-employee data to study the reallocation of heterogeneous workers between heterogeneous firms. We build on recent evidence of a cyclical job ladder that reallocates workers from low-productivity to high-productivity firms through job-to-job moves. In this paper, we turn to the question of who moves up this job ladder and the implications for worker sorting across firms. Not surprisingly, we find that job-to-job moves reallocate younger workers disproportionately from less productive to more productive firms. More surprisingly, especially in the context of the recent literature on assortative matching with on-the-job search, we find that job-to-job moves disproportionately reallocate less educated workers up the job ladder. This finding holds even though we find that more educated workers are more likely to work with more productive firms. We find that while highly educated workers are less likely to match to low-productivity firms, they are also less likely to separate from them, with less educated workers more likely to separate to a better employer in expansions and to be shaken off the ladder (separate to nonemployment) in contractions. Our findings underscore the cyclical role job-to-job moves play in matching workers to better-paying employers.",Erika McEntarfer; Henry Hyatt; Henry R.

Working Longer in the U.S.: Trends and Explanations,"Over the past two decades, labor force participation rates for older men have been rising, reversing a century-long trend towards earlier retirement.Participation rates for older women are rising as well.A number of theories have been put forward to explain the rise in participation at older ages, including improving mortality and health, increasing education and a shift towards less physically demanding work, and changes in employer-provided benefits and Social Security.This paper documents trends in labor force participation and employment at older ages and in the factors that may be contributing to rising participation.A review of these trends and of the relevant literature suggests that increases in education, women's growing role in the economy, the shift from defined benefit to defined contribution pension plans, and Social Security reforms all likely played some role in the trend towards longer work lives.",Courtney Coile,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w24576,Geography,National Bureau of Economic Research; Wellesley College,"NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Wellesley College 106 Central Street Wellesley, MA 02481 and NBER","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Wellesley College 106 Central Street Wellesley, MA 02481 and NBER"
Women Working Longer: Facts and Some Explanations,"American women are working more, through their sixties and even into their seventies.Their increased participation at older ages started in the late 1980s before the turnaround in older men's labor force participation and the economic downturns of the 2000s.The higher labor force participation of older women consists disproportionately of those working at full-time jobs.Increased labor force participation of women in their older ages is part of the general increase in cohort labor force participation.Cohort effects, in turn, are mainly a function of educational advances and greater prior work experience.But labor force participation rates of the most recent cohorts in their forties are less than those for previous cohorts.It would appear that employment at older ages could stagnate or even decrease.But several other factors will be operating in an opposing direction leading us to conclude that women are likely to continue to work even longer.",Claudia Goldin; Lawrence Katz,,,,,,,,,,,,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w22607,Psychology,National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"Department of Economics Harvard University Cambridge, MA 02138 and NBER; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Harvard University Cambridge, MA 02138","Department of Economics Harvard University Cambridge, MA 02138 and NBER; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Harvard University Cambridge, MA 02138"
Financial Incentives and Earnings of Disability Insurance Recipients: Evidence from a Notch Design,"Most countries reduce Disability Insurance (DI) benefits for beneficiaries earning above a specified threshold.Such an earnings threshold generates a discontinuous increase in tax liability -a notch-and creates an incentive to keep earnings below the threshold.Exploiting such a notch in Austria, we provide transparent and credible identification of the effect of financial incentives on DI beneficiaries' earnings.Using rich administrative data, we document large and sharp bunching at the earnings threshold.However, the elasticity driving these responses is small.Our estimate suggests that relaxing the earnings threshold reduces fiscal cost only if program entry is very inelastic.",Philippe Ruh; Stefan Staubli,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w24830,"Earnings, Incentive, Disability insurance, Economics, Liability, Earnings response coefficient, Business, Labour economics, Finance, Microeconomics, Social security, Market economy",University of Zurich; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Calgary; Center for Interuniversity Research and Analysis on Organizations; HEC Montréal,"Department of Economics University of Calgary 2500 University Drive NW Calgary, AB T2N 1N4 CANADA; seminar participants at HEC Montréal, the University of Calgary, the Vienna; Department of Economics University of Zurich Schönberggasse; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138;  8001 Zurich Switzerland; University of Economics and Business, the University of Zurich, CIRANO Montreal,","seminar participants at HEC Montréal, the University of Calgary, the Vienna; Department of Economics University of Calgary 2500 University Drive NW Calgary, AB T2N 1N4 CANADA; Department of Economics University of Zurich Schönberggasse; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138;  8001 Zurich Switzerland; University of Economics and Business, the University of Zurich, CIRANO Montreal,"
Using Non-Linear Budget Sets to Estimate Extensive Margin Responses: Method and Evidence from the Social Security Earnings Test,"We develop a method for estimating the effect of a kinked or notched budget set on workers' employment decisions, and we use it to estimate the impact of the Social Security Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Annual Earnings Test (AET).The AET reduces OASI claimants' current OASI benefits in proportion to their earnings in excess of an exempt amount.Using a Regression Kink Design and Social Security Administration data, we document that the discontinuous change in the benefit reduction rate at the exempt amount causes a corresponding change in the slope of the employment rate.We develop conditions in a general setting under which we can use such patterns to estimate the elasticity of the employment rate with respect to the effective average net-of-tax rate.Our resulting point estimate for the AET indicates an elasticity of at least 0.49, suggesting that the AET reduces employment by more than one percentage point in the group we study.",Alexander Gelber; Damon Jones; Daniel Sacks; Daniel W.

Does Eliminating the Earnings Test Increase the Incidence of Low Income Among Older Women?,"Reducing or eliminating Social Security's retirement earnings test (RET) can encourage labor supply of older individuals receiving benefits. However, these reforms can encourage earlier claiming of Social Security benefits, permanently lowering future benefits. We explore the consequences, for older women, of eliminating the RET from the full retirement age to age 69 (in 2000), relying on the intercohort variation in exposure to changes in the RET to estimate these effects. The evidence is consistent with the conclusion that eliminating the RET increased the likelihood of having very low incomes among women in their mid-70s and older-ages at which the lower benefits from claiming earlier could outweigh higher income in the earlier period when women or their husbands increased their labor supply.",David Neumark; Theodore F.

"Networking Frictions in Venture Capital, and the Gender Gap in Entrepreneurship","Exploiting random variation in the number of venture capitalist (VC) judges assigned to panels at Harvard Business School's New Venture Competition (NVC) between 2000 and 2015, we find that exposure to more VC judges increases male participants' chances of founding a VC-backed startup after HBS much more than this exposure increases female participants' chances.A survey suggests this is in part because male participants more often proactively reach out to VC judges after the NVC.Our results suggest that networking frictions are an important reason men benefit more than women from exposure to VCs.Such frictions can help explain part of the gender gap in entrepreneurship, and also have implications for how to design networking opportunities to facilitate financing of the best (rather than just the best networked) ideas.",Ramana Nanda; Sabrina Howell; Sabrina T Howell,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w26449,"Venture capital, Entrepreneurship, Social venture capital, Business, Gender gap, Capital (architecture), Economics, Labour economics, Finance, Geography, Archaeology",National Bureau of Economic Research; New York University; Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center,"NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; NYU Stern School of Business KMC 9-93 44 West 4th Street New York, NY 10012 and; Harvard Business School Rock Center 317 Soldiers Field Boston, MA 02163","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; NYU Stern School of Business KMC 9-93 44 West 4th Street New York, NY 10012 and; Harvard Business School Rock Center 317 Soldiers Field Boston, MA 02163"
Firming Up Inequality*,"Abstract We use a massive, matched employer-employee database for the United States to analyze the contribution of firms to the rise in earnings inequality from 1978 to 2013. We find that one-third of the rise in the variance of (log) earnings occurred within firms, whereas two-thirds of the rise occurred due to a rise in the dispersion of average earnings between firms. However, this rising between-firm variance is not accounted for by the firms themselves but by a widening gap between firms in the composition of their workers. This compositional change can be split into two roughly equal parts: high-wage workers became increasingly likely to work in high-wage firms (i.e., sorting increased), and high-wage workers became increasingly likely to work with each other (i.e., segregation rose). In contrast, we do not find a rise in the variance of firm-specific pay once we control for the worker composition in firms. Finally, we find that two-thirds of the rise in the within-firm variance of earnings occurred within mega (10,000+ employee) firms, which saw a particularly large increase in the variance of earnings compared with smaller firms.",David J Price; David J.

A larger share is attributable to the human capital of the highest-paid workers, that is, the managers. A similar share is mediated through the pay premiums offered by better-managed firms.

Digital Innovation and the Distribution of Income,"Income inequalities have increased in most OECD countries over the past decades; particularly the income share of the top 1%.In this paper we argue that the growing importance of digital innovation -new products and processes based on software code and data -has increased market rents, which benefit disproportionately the top income groups.In line with Schumpeter's vision, digital innovation gives rise to ""winner-take-all"" market structures, characterized by higher market power and risk than was the case in the previous economy of tangible products.The cause for these new market structures is digital non-rivalry, which allows for massive economies of scale and reduces costs of innovation.The latter stimulates higher rates of creative destruction, leading to higher risk as only marginally superior products can take over the entire market, hence rendering market shares unstable.Instability commands risk premia for investors.Market rents accrue mainly to investors and top managers and less to the average workers, hence increasing income inequality.Market rents are needed to incentivize innovation and compensate for its costs, but beyond a certain level they become detrimental.Public policy may stimulate innovation by reducing ex ante the market conditions which favor rent extraction from anti-competitive practices.",Caroline Paunov; Dominique Guellec,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w23987,"Distribution (mathematics), Income distribution, Business, Economics, Labour economics, Computer science, Mathematics, Inequality, Mathematical analysis",Organisation de Coopération et de Développement Economiques; National Bureau of Economic Research,"NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; OECD/OCDE 2, rue Andre Pascal 75016 Paris France; OECD 2, rue André Pascal 75 775 Paris Cedex 16 France","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; OECD/OCDE 2, rue Andre Pascal 75016 Paris France; OECD 2, rue André Pascal 75 775 Paris Cedex 16 France"
The Rise of Domestic Outsourcing and the Evolution of the German Wage Structure*,"Abstract The nature of the relationship between employers and employees has been changing over the past three decades, with firms increasingly relying on contractors, temp agencies, and franchises rather than hiring employees directly. We investigate the impact of this transformation on the wage structure by following jobs that are moved outside the boundary of lead employers to contracting firms. We develop a new method for identifying outsourcing of food, cleaning, security, and logistics services in administrative data using the universe of social security records in Germany. We document a dramatic growth of domestic outsourcing in Germany since the early 1990s. Event-study analyses show that wages in outsourced jobs fall by approximately 10–15% relative to similar jobs that are not outsourced. We find evidence that the wage losses associated with outsourcing stem from a loss of firm-specific rents, suggesting that labor cost savings are an important reason firms choose to contract out these services. Finally, we tie the increase in outsourcing activity to broader changes in the German wage structure, in particular showing that outsourcing of cleaning, security, and logistics services alone accounts for around 9% of the increase in German wage inequality since the 1980s.",Deborah Goldschmidt; Johannes F.

Firms and the Decline in Earnings Inequality in Brazil,"We document a large decrease in earnings inequality in Brazil between 1996 and 2012.Using administrative linked employer-employee data, we fit high-dimensional worker and firm fixed effects models to understand the sources of this decrease. Firm effects account for40 percent of the total decrease and worker effects for 29 percent. Changes in observable worker and firm characteristics contributed little to these trends. Instead, the decrease isprimarily due to a compression of returns to these characteristics, particularly a declining firm productivity pay premium.

One-third of this response is driven by borrowers who take out second mortgages, which implies that total mortgage debt only declines by 1.5 to 2 percent.

Earnings Inequality and the Minimum Wage: Evidence from Brazil,"Increases in the minimum wage can substantially reduce earnings inequality. To demonstrate this, we combine administrative and survey data with an equilibrium model of the Brazilian labor market. We find that a 128 percent increase in the real minimum wage in Brazil between 1996 and 2018 had far-reaching spillover effects on wages higher up in the distribution. The increased minimum wage accounts for 45 percent of a large fall in earnings inequality over this period. At the same time, the effects of the minimum wage on employment and output are muted by reallocation of workers toward more productive firms..

Within-Firm Pay Inequality,"Financial regulators and investors have expressed concerns about high pay inequality within firms. Using a proprietary data set of public and private firms, this paper shows that firms with higher pay inequality—relative wage differentials between top- and bottom-level jobs—are larger and have higher valuations and stronger operating performance. Moreover, firms with higher pay inequality exhibit larger equity returns and greater earnings surprises, suggesting that pay inequality is not fully priced by the market. Our results support the notion that differences in pay inequality across firms are a reflection of differences in managerial talent.

Wage Inequality and Firm Growth,"We discuss firm-level evidence based on UK data showing that within-firm pay inequality--wage differentials between top- and bottom-level jobs--increases with firm size. Moreover, within-firm pay inequality rises as firms grow larger over time. Lastly, using wage data from 15 developed countries, we document a positive association between aggregate wage inequality at the country level and growth by the largest firms in the country.

Tourism and Economic Development: Evidence from Mexico’s Coastline,"Tourism is a fast-growing services sector in developing countries. This paper combines a rich collection of Mexican microdata with a quantitative spatial equilibrium model and a new empirical strategy to study the long-term economic consequences of tourism both locally and in the aggregate. We find that tourism causes large and significant local economic gains relative to less touristic regions that are in part driven by significant positive spillovers on manufacturing. In the aggregate, however, these local spillovers are largely offset by reductions in agglomeration economies among less touristic regions, so that the national gains from trade in tourism are mainly driven by a classical market integration effect.

Local Labor Market Impacts of the Energy Transition: Prospects and Policies,"Society's transition toward more sustainable energy sources is well underway.But substantially reducing the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity, to power vehicles, and to manufacture the stuff of everyday life will profoundly disrupt the communities that currently dedicate themselves to carbon-intensive industries.In this paper, I consider the potential for adverse labor market consequences from the energy transition and the suitability of existing policies to counteract them.Top of mind in this discussion is to avoid repeating the painful adjustment to globalization and automation, which in recent decades brought concentrated job loss and long-lasting economic distress to local labor markets that had been specialized in manufacturing.I begin by mapping the spatial distribution of employment in fossil-fuel-intensive activities across US commuting zones from 2000 forward.Then, using the labor market consequences of the post-1980 decline of coal as a backdrop, I discuss policy options for easing adjustment to the energy transition, including letting market forces work, reinforcing the social safety net, and expanding place-based policies.",Gordon Hanson,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w30871,"Transition (genetics), Energy transition, Economics, Natural resource economics, Labour economics, Energy (signal processing), Business, Economic system, Chemistry, Physics, Medicine, Biochemistry, Alternative medicine, Pathology, Quantum mechanics, Gene, Panacea (medicine)",National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University; John F.

The Effects of Foreign Multinationals on Workers and Firms in the United States,"Abstract Governments go to great lengths to attract foreign multinationals because they are thought to raise the wages paid to their employees (direct effects) and to improve outcomes at local domestic firms (indirect effects). We construct the first U.S. employer-employee data set with foreign ownership information from tax records to measure these direct and indirect effects. We find the average direct effect of a foreign multinational firm on its U.S. workers is a 7% increase in wages. This premium is larger for higher-skilled workers and for the employees of firms from high GDP per capita countries. We find evidence that it is membership in a multinational production network—instead of foreignness—that generates the foreign-firm premium. We leverage the past spatial clustering of foreign-owned firms by country of ownership to identify the indirect effects. An expansion in the foreign-multinational share of commuting-zone employment substantially increases the employment, value added, and—for higher-earning workers—wages at local domestic-owned firms. Per job created by a foreign multinational, our estimates suggest annual gains of US$13,400 to the aggregate wages of local incumbents, two-thirds of which are from indirect effects. Our estimates suggest that—via mega-deals for subsidies from local governments—foreign multinationals are able to extract a sizable fraction of the local surplus they generate.",Bradley Setzler; Felix Tintelnot,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjab015,"Multinational corporation, Foreign direct investment, Leverage (statistics), Business, Foreign ownership, Labour economics, Subsidy, Economics, Market economy, Finance, Machine learning, Computer science, Macroeconomics",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago,"University of Chicago and National Bureau of Economic Research, United States; University of Chicago, United States","University of Chicago and National Bureau of Economic Research, United States; University of Chicago, United States"
Institutions and the fortunes of territories,"Regions and cities face unceasing pressures to adapt in response to processes of globalization, changes in industrial production, and new patterns of migration and trade. At the same time, the dominant development policies are proving less than capable of providing answers to these challenges. Strategies based on a mix of physical and human capital and technology have not succeeded in dealing with growing territorial inequality and its treacherous economic, social and political consequences. There is thus an urgent need to understand why territorial divergence occurs and why there is what seems to be a growing decline in the returns of public intervention targeting economic development. In the search for answers, scholars have turned to the examination of institutions. But despite progress in our grasp of how institutions affect development, crucial knowledge gaps remain. This paper reviews recent progress in our understanding of the role of institutions for development, unveils the most important gaps, and proposes a series of avenues to improve how a better understanding of how institutions shape regional and urban development can lead to more efficient development policies. Las regiones y las ciudades se enfrentan a presiones continuas de adaptación en respuesta a los procesos de globalización, cambios en la producción industrial y las nuevas pautas de migración y comercio. Al mismo tiempo, las políticas de desarrollo dominantes están demostrando ser menos capaces de dar respuestas a estos desafíos. Las estrategias basadas en una mezcla de capital físico y humano y tecnología no han logrado hacer frente a la creciente desigualdad territorial y sus peligrosas consecuencias económicas, sociales y políticas. Por consiguiente, es urgente comprender por qué se producen divergencias territoriales y por qué se produce lo que parece ser una disminución creciente de los beneficios de la intervención pública orientada al desarrollo económico. En la búsqueda de respuestas, la investigación ha recurrido al examen de las instituciones. Pero a pesar de los avances en la comprensión de cómo las instituciones afectan al desarrollo, siguen existiendo lagunas de conocimiento cruciales. En este artículo se examinan los progresos recientes en nuestra comprensión de la función de las instituciones para el desarrollo, se revelan las lagunas más importantes y se propone una serie de vías para mejorar la forma en que una mejor comprensión de la manera en que las instituciones configuran el desarrollo regional y urbano puede conducir a políticas de desarrollo más eficientes. 地域や都市は、グローバル化の過程、工業生産の変化、移住や商取引の新しいパターンに対応して適応させられる圧力に絶え間なく直面している。それと同時に、支配的開発政策は、これらの課題に対処する能力がないことが明らかになってきている。物理的資本と人的資本と技術の組み合わせを基にした戦略では、拡大する地域格差と、その危険性を孕む経済的、社会的、政治的影響には対処することができない。そのため、なぜ地域格差が生じているのか、なぜ経済発展を目的とした公的介入のリターンが減少しているようにみられるのかを解明することが急務である。答えを探すために、研究者たちは機関を調査することを始めた。しかし、制度が開発にどのように影響するか理解が進んでいるにもかかわらず、知識の大きなギャップが今なお存在している。本稿では、開発のための機関の役割に関する我々の理解の最近の進展を概観し、最も大きなギャップを明らかする。そして、機関が地域/都市開発をどのように形成しているかをよりよく理解することが、より効率的な開発政策につながる方法を改善するための一連の方法を提案する。 Regions and cities have been receiving ever-greater attention as the locus of socio-economic research and, increasingly, as the focus of development practice. Facing unceasing pressures to adapt and change in response to new and uncertain circumstances—including the onset of strong globalization forces, the spatial re-shifting of industrial production, and new patterns of international migration and trade—territories the world over, as well as the countries and supranational organizations they belong to, have sought to set up development strategies to restructure their economic bases in order to remain both competitive and sustainable. Most development strategies have been firmly anchored in traditional economic growth theory. According to the dominant theories in economics, economic growth and changes in employment and productivity are the result of a combination of three factors: physical capital, human capital or labour, and innovation. In addition, there is a residual factor or error term, which represents the part behind economic performance that we do not know or cannot explain using the traditional components of physical capital, human capital and innovation. Depending on the chosen approach to economic performance, the weight attributed to each of the components varies. The neoclassical growth strand (Solow, 1956; Swan, 1956) put the emphasis on physical capital. The endogenous growth approach (Romer, 1986: Lucas, 1988) focused on human capital and innovation. In turn, the new economic geography (Fujita, Krugman, & Venables, 1999; Krugman, 1991, 2011) and urban economics (Glaeser, 2011) stressed the role of agglomeration economies, externalities and density. These three factors—plus agglomeration and density—continue to be the fundamental elements informing theoretical and empirical thinking about economic development policies and, consequently, development strategies across the world often remain anchored in these theoretical frameworks. The European Union's (EU) Cohesion policy—the largest development policy in the world—has been no exception. The bulk of cohesion investments have been channelled towards improving infrastructure endowment and accessibility, as well as increasing the availability and quality of human resources, and developing the innovative capacity of individuals and firms across the less developed areas of Europe. The impact of this type of intervention has been, however, controversial. For some (e.g., Becker, Egger, & von Ehrlich, 2010, 2018; Cappelen, Castellacci, Fagerberg, & Verspagen, 2003; Cerqua & Pellegrini, 2018; Crescenzi & Giua, 2020; Ferrara, McCann, Pellegrini, Stelder, & Terribile, 2017; ; Pellegrini, Terribile, Tarola, Muccigrosso, & Busillo, 2013), European-wide investment focusing on these three areas of intervention has delivered greater prosperity to those regions that have benefited the most from the policy. For others, in contrast, the returns of European investment on cohesion have been below expectations (Boldrin & Canova, 2001; Dall'erba & Le Gallo, 2008; Mohl & Hagen, 2010) and often conditional on the type of intervention and the characteristics of the receiving region (e.g., Dall'erba & Le Gallo, 2007, 2008; Ederveen, Groot, & Nahuis, 2006; Falk & Sinabell, 2008; Mohl & Hagen, 2010). The stark reality is that while some regions and cities have thrived—frequently becoming highly networked, technology-intensive and creative—some have endured far bumpier rides, while others have fared much worse and are, in some extreme cases, grappling with strong decline. The presence of highly dynamic winning cities and regions alongside areas that have seen long-term economic decay and are increasingly regarded as places with scarce economic opportunities is creating a ""geography of discontent"" (Dijkstra, Poelman, & Rodríguez-Pose, 2019; Los, McCann, Springford, & Thissen, 2017; McCann, 2020; Rodríguez-Pose, 2018). This ""geography of discontent"" is currently having significant economic, social and political implications. As indicated by The Economist on 17 December 2016, rising subnational inequality ""is proving too politically dangerous to ignore."" Hence, understanding why these divergences occur is one of the principal dilemmas confronting the social sciences today: why do seemingly identical or very similar regions and cities sometimes perform so differently? Or, put in another way, what are the key factors that affect the economic fortunes of territories? This paper will look at why our theoretical toolbox is increasingly failing when trying to explain the economic trajectories of regions and cities and how a greater focus on how institutions, governance and government quality shape economic activity may not only allow us to explain better the differences in the economic performances of territories, but also provide the basis for a sounder and more efficient development policy at subnational level. In order to do that, I will first look at the ""problem,"" namely why are we struggling to adequately comprehend the diverse economic trajectories of cities and regions. Then I will identify what I consider to be a number of critical gaps in our knowledge, before turning to the analysis of institutions as a potential solution to the ""problem."" The penultimate section of the paper will outline potential ways forward in order to improve both our understanding of what triggers economic development as well as the design, delivery and implementation of development policies. The conclusions are presented in final section. If scientific research has struggled to properly understand why some territories fail while others thrive, the answer may lay in the deficiencies in our theoretical toolbox and how they have affected development policy interventions in cities and regions. In recent years it has become increasingly clear that we are witnessing a decline in the returns of intervention in the three traditional main growth axes. There is, for example, concern about a potential exhaustion of additional investments in transport infrastructure and of improvements in accessibility as drivers of growth (Crescenzi, Di Cataldo, & Rodríguez-Pose, 2016; Crescenzi & Rodríguez-Pose, 2012). There is also growing scepticism about the viability and returns of investing in technology and innovation in areas that are far away from the technological frontier (Acemoglu, Aghion, & Zilibotti, 2006; Farole et al., 2011; Filippetti & Peyrache, 2015). Furthermore, distance to the technological frontier may also affect the economic impact of investment in human capital (Rodríguez-Pose & Ketterer, 2019; Sterlacchini, 20082008; Vandenbussche, Aghion, & Meghir, 2006). Overall, the combination of physical capital, human capital, and technology explains a waning share of the variation in territorial—regional and urban—development. Economic theories that accounted for differences in development performance relatively well two decades ago are becoming less capable of doing so (Rodríguez-Pose, 2013). The residual factor is growing, meaning that, in spite of substantial improvements in growth theory, methods and data availability, we tend to be able to explain less about what determines the fortunes of territories. This declining explanatory capacity signals that a key ingredient in the growth and development equation has been missing. Especially at the empirical level, ""stubbornly high—and often growing—residuals in growth regressions have encouraged many scholars to look for additional factors that impinge on economic development and growth beyond traditional growth theories"" (Rodríguez-Pose, 2013, p. 1036). Most eyes have turned to the role of institutions, in general, and government quality, in particular, for answers (Charron, Dijkstra, & Lapuente, 2014, 2015). Indeed, according to Rodrik, Subramanian, and Trebbi (2004), institutions trump traditional factors such as trade, resource endowments, and geography in their significance and influence on economic development. However, although the literature concerning the role of institutions for development is becoming more voluminous and transcends numerous academic disciplines, scholarly research is labouring to go beyond the idea that ""institutions matter."" Hence, how institutions shape economic progress still remains the ""dark matter"" of economic development (Storper, 2010). There are several areas where the literature on the links between institutions and development has faced considerable stumbling blocks. First and most importantly, work trying to link institutional quality to economic development has been confronted with the issue that defining institutions is difficult and remains fraught with controversy. Concepts about institutions are subjective when not outright contentious (Rodríguez-Pose, 2013). Second, measuring and operationalizing the institutional dimension is problematic for several reasons: (i) many different types of institutions are context and geography specific and what is an efficient institutional arrangement in one place may not necessarily work in another (Chang, 2003); (ii) time also affects the returns of specific institutional arrangements (Storper, 2005); (iii) institutions and development also tend to be endogenous: good institutions promote development and development, in turn, promotes institutional improvements (Chang, 2011; Rodrik, 2004); and (iv) institutions are also closely connected to the three other determinants of growth and with innovation and education, in particular (Glaeser, La Porta, López-de-Silanes, & Shleifer, 2004). These difficulties make measuring and operationalizing institutions, especially at the regional and urban level, particularly problematic. Despite these notable barriers, considerable progress has been made of late in terms of measuring institutions and their impact at subnational level in different parts of the world (e.g., Beer & Lester, 2015, for Australia; Rodríguez-Pose & Zhang, 2019, 2020 and Wang, 2019, for China), but particularly in Europe. The Quality of Government Institute of the University of Gothenburg has made the largest contribution in this respect. The Quality of Government Institute generated, at the request of the European Commission, a comprehensive subjective quality of government (QoG) index for virtually all regions of Europe (Charron, Lapuente, & Rothstein, 2011; Charron et al., 2014). This index has now been produced in three waves: 2010, 2013 and 2017. It became an instant hit since its release, with several researchers resorting to it as the main indicator of institutional quality across regions of Europe. The common the nominator of most of the studies using this index is that institutional quality is a fundamental factor in explaining not only the economic growth trajectories, but also innovation, productivity or employment across regions of Europe. The consensus is that institutional quality matters, and that it matters a lot (e.g., Ketterer & Rodríguez-Pose, 2018), as an explanation of the divergent economic paths of subnational territories in virtually all economic realms. Public institutions are, according to Morgan (2017, p. 571), ""needed to broker connections and nurture novelty."" More specifically, institutional quality determines the capacity of regions and cities to compete in a more economically integrated world (Annoni & Dijkstra, 2013; Huggins, Izushi, Prokop, & Thompson, 2014). It drives differences in employment growth and social inclusion (Di Cataldo and Rodríguez-Pose, 2017), as well as in entrepreneurship (Audretsch & Belitski, 2017; Fritsch & Wyrwich, 2018; Huggins & Thompson, 2016; Nistotskaya, Charron, & Lapuente, 2015; Wyrwich, Stuetzer, & Sternberg, 2016) and innovation capacity (Rodríguez-Pose & Di Cataldo, 2015; Sleuwaegen & Boiardi, 2014). Local institutional conditions also determine environmental responses to climate challenges (Halkos, Sundström, & Tzeremes, 2015) and shape the participation of individuals in politics and policy (Sundström & Wängnerud, 2014). As importantly, on top of the above-mentioned direct effects, differences in institutional quality across subnational territories have weighty indirect implications on the effectiveness of other policies. They, for example, shape the returns of development and/or cohesion intervention (Glückler & Lenz, 2016; Rodríguez-Pose & Garcilazo, 2015), influence the choice of public goods—as, for example, the different types of transport infrastructure investments pursued in different places (Crescenzi et al., 2016). They also condition the economic impact of political processes, such as decentralization (Muringani, Fitjar, & Rodríguez-Pose, 2019) and determine, to a large extent, how attractive a territory is for potential migrants (Ketterer & Rodríguez-Pose, 2015). Overall, differences in institutional quality across territories can be considered today as important as—if not more important than—variations in physical and human capital endowments and innovation capacity for the economic development of cities and regions (Rodríguez-Pose & Ketterer, 2019). All this recent work on how institutions and government quality affect development strategies and, consequently, the economic performance of territories represents a substantial progress in our understanding of the role of institutions as shapers of economic development at subnational level and, especially, in lagging areas. However—and in spite of the progress made—this research continues to be highly divided (see, for example, the contrasts in Acemoglu and Johnson's (2005) approach vs. that of Chang (2011)—and remains limited on a number of counts. First, recent work has generally regarded institutional conditions as a static factor. The quality of local institutions is considered to be fundamentally a result of history (Charron & Lapuente, 2013). Institutions are built on decades, if not centuries of history, and, therefore, for many they can hardly be changed through policy intervention. They are path dependent and generally assumed to be a permanent feature of a territory. If the South of Italy has underperformed the rest of the country for now several centuries, it is because of the institutional divergence that took place between the North and the South of Italy in the Middle Ages (Putnam, 1993). Hence, institutions are often regarded as permanent features of a territory that facilitate or impede the adequate development of economic activity. Yet, institutional quality does not always remain still. It can change and, under specific circumstances, the transformation can take place swiftly (Rodríguez-Pose & Storper, 2006), often through processes linked to agency (Grillitsch & Sotarauta, 2019). Many Central and Eastern European countries, cities and regions improved their institutional quality rather rapidly after the fall of communism. Others, by contrast, did not. Despite some exceptions (e.g., Rodríguez-Pose & Ketterer, 2019), the capacity for institutions to change and, accordingly, transform the economic potential of a place has been generally neglected by research to date. Second, most analyses of the role of institutions on economic development have tended to put the emphasis on formal institutions often at the expense of informal institutions. The rule of law or property rights, for example, have featured prominently in most seminal empirical institutional studies (e.g., Acemoglu & Johnson, 2005; Rodrik et al., 2004), while the interest on informal institutions—such as values, culture, trust, openness, networks, tolerance, diversity, creativity or social capital—has considerably lagged behind. This is something that is difficult to understand, especially as the quality of data on values and social capital has kept on improving in recent decades. The few exceptions in this respect (e.g., Beugelsdijk & Klasing, 2016; Beugelsdijk, Klasing, & Milionis, 2019; Cortinovis, Xiao, Boschma, & van Oort, 2017) provide interesting insights, but still fall far short of the attention that the role of informal institutions for economic development deserves. Third, most subnational research has limited itself to establishing whether institutions matter or not for economic development. However, limited attention has been paid to the exact transmission mechanisms through which institutions affect economic outcomes. Hence, we know relatively little about the ways in which different types of formal and informal institutions affect the economic development of cities and regions. Last but not least, there is still a long way to go in order to transform research on the impact of institutions on economic development at subnational level into effective, evidence-based policies. While there is an increasing recognition of the institutional dimension in development policies and of the importance of mitigating and minimizing the potential for institutionally-related failures, there is still considerable scope to both incorporate place-sensitive institutional reforms and capacity-building initiatives into the development strategies themselves, based on more detailed research of the dynamics and mechanisms at play between institutional factors and development outcomes. Institutions are fundamental for the development of economic activities: they are the rules that govern (North, 1990) and promote (Nelson & Nelson, 2002) human interaction and economic change. Recent research has tended to highlight the fact that institutions matter for economic development, but, most of this research has paid more attention to institutional stability 1 and less to the processes of change (Scott, 2013). Indeed, according to Chang (2011) the dominant views on the link between institutions and development have overlooked the importance of institutional change. Hence, whether institutional change affects the economic performance of cities and regions in Europe and elsewhere remains, to a large extent, underexplored. Do institutional improvements affect economic development at subnational level in any significant way? Do poor institutional endowments represent an unsurmountable barrier for economic development, especially in less developed regions and cities as hinted by past research (e.g., Putnam, 1993)? Dealing with these questions at subnational level implies far more research than the limited analyses conducted to date (e.g., Rodríguez-Pose & Ketterer, 2019). There is a need to assess whether both the initial levels and the degree of institutional change affect regional and urban economic performance in the same way within countries and across different geographies (e.g., Grillitsch, 2015). Particular emphasis is required to determine how institutions co-evolve (Gong & Hassink, 2019) and how institutional change determines economic performance in lagging regions, those that traditionally have a weaker institutional ecosystem. In this respect it is essential to discriminate between the role played by traditional areas in development policy intervention, such as infrastructure, human capital and innovation, relative to that of different formal and informal institutional aspects, such as corruption, openness, social capital, tolerance, the rule of law, government effectiveness and government accountability. The focus has to fall squarely on changes in all these factors. Moreover, the analysis of the dynamics of institutional change needs to rise above considering regions and cities as uniform. It has to start differentiating between territories, using the whole spectrum of cities and regions, in a way that takes into account their unique characteristics (e.g., European Commission, 2014). We need to know more about whether improving institutional quality by either increasing social capital and tolerance, reducing widespread corruption, cultivating human capital and fostering absorptive capacity, or introducing measures aimed at making government decisions more efficient and transparent represents as important a requisite for territorial development at subnational level as conducting more traditional ""hard"" types of regional development investments (Malecki, 2012). We also need to know more about what determines the emergence of able and effective local leaders (Beer & Clower, 2014). Future research, therefore, will have to dig deeper into whether measures aimed at reducing the monopoly power of bureaucrats (Bardhan, 1997; Rose-Ackerman, 1978) or creating a more adequate incentive pay structure for public administration (Bardhan, 1997; Tanzi, 1998) pay off; into whether e-government initiatives and a wider use of ICTs in government can also deliver improvements in government efficiency and transparency (Pina, Torres, & Royo, 2007); whether cutting red-tape (Håkanson, 2013), as well as measures aimed at increasing the education levels of civil servants can further redress public sector inefficiencies and promote economic growth (Afonso, Schuknecht, & Tanzi, 2010); or whether increasing tolerance and openness triggers economic development (Florida, Mellander, & Stolarick, 2008). We also need to know more about how can different places break out of current practices and improve their institutional conditions. There is often the perception that local institutional conditions are sticky and take a very long time—often centuries—to change, (e.g., Putnam, 1993). This generates an institutional path dependency, resulting in lock-in in a large number of places. However, changes can also take place in relatively short periods. In the European context, for example, the rapid recent improvements of institutions in a country like Estonia strongly contrast with stasis, rigidity, and reluctance to change in Italy. Hence, there is a need to better comprehend the dynamics of change, taking both into account the starting institutional—both formal and informal—conditions as well as the dynamic of different groups within a society and the balance between bonding and bridging relationships. As indicated by Rodríguez-Pose and Storper (2006, p. 15), ""places with strong groups and strong societies will be characterized by institutional arrangements with problem-solving mechanisms that help to resolve tensions and agency problems."" Yet, there is a need to know more and the division between institutional environment, which refers to higher levels institutions such as identity or culture, and institutional arrangements, touching place-specific customs and habits (Martin, 2000; Rodríguez-Pose, 2013). Likewise, appraising whether institutional progress, such as the enactment of public legislation and implementing policy measures aimed at improving the efficiency of government, enhancing voice and accountability, and/or reducing corruption can lead to better public interventions, characterized by a more efficient use of public expenditure, in general, and public investment, in particular (Afonso & Fernandes, 2006), represents a vital avenue for future research. However, this implies acknowledging that institutional bottlenecks are at the heart of development problems and adequately recognizing the role played by institutional quality in development (Tanzi, 1998). Institutional quality must then be raised to the rank of a fundamental factor in growth equations, on a par with transport infrastructure, education and training, and technology and innovation. However, as Persson, Rothstein, and Teorell (2013) stress, awareness of the problem alone is not sufficient and an in-depth knowledge of the mechanisms behind institutional change and how it affects urban and regional economic performance is required as an initial step to be able to formulate solid, evidence-based policies. Formal institutions generally refer to institutions that are defined by ""transparent and codified rules"" (Rodríguez-Pose & Storper, 2006, p. 2). As such, they are universal, transferable, and determine human interaction (North, 1990; Rodríguez-Pose, 2013). The quality of formal institutions therefore has the potential to significantly affect economic development (Acemoglu & Johnson; 2005; Charron, Dijkstra, & Lapuente, 2014; Rodríguez-Pose, 2013). Informal institutions generally refer ""to features of group life, such as norms, traditions and social conventions, interpersonal contacts, relationships, and informal networks"" (Rodríguez-Pose & Storper, 2006, p. 1). In the same way as formal institutions, informal institutions can play a central role in determining economic development (e.g., Duranton, Rodríguez-Pose, & Sandall, 2009; Florida et al., 2008; Putnam, 1993; Rodríguez-Pose, 2013; Tabellini, 2010). However, due to difficulties in defining and operationalizing informal institutions (Lee, 2017), the research focusing on how informal institutions influence economic performance at subnational level is much more limited than that dealing with formal institutions. While there is no shortage of academic work on issues such as how differences in the power awarded to subnational governments (e.g., Marks, Hooghe, & Schakel, 2008; Rodríguez-Pose & Ezcurra, 2011) or in government quality (e.g., Annoni & Dijkstra, 2013; Charron et al., 2014; Nistotskaya et al., 2015; Rodríguez-Pose & Di Cataldo, 2015; Rodríguez-Pose & Garcilazo, 2015) shape different aspects of subnational competitiveness in Europe, the focus on the role of informal institutions is still mostly absent. Hence, examining how informal institutions impinge on urban and regional performance at a subnational level would address a fundamental gap in our knowledge. Economic interaction and progress is highly dependent on the specific informal institutional conditions of the context in which the economic activity takes place (Cortinovis et al., 2017; Lee, 2017; Rodríguez-Pose, 2013; Tabellini, 2010). Local levels of diversity, openness, trust and tolerance—among other factors—determine to a large extent what type of economic activity occurs in a specific place and affect its innovativeness, creativity, and productivity (Florida et al., 2008; Kemeny & Cooke, 2017). Yet, the empirical studies that have aimed to assess the link between informal institutions—from family structures to culture—and economic development (e.g., Cortinovis et al., 2017; Duranton et al., 2009; Tabellini, 2010) remain scarce. Two types of questions require urgent answers. First of all, to what extent do informal institutions shape urban and regional economic development? Do they do it in a similar way as formal institutions? Or do they follow different paths? Second, it is crucial to understand how do formal and informal institutions interact in specific subnational territories in order to generate economic development, as formal and informal institutions ""are mutually influential in shaping a variety of [economic] outcomes"" (Storper, 2014, p. 117). Answering these two types of questions requires going well beyond the sor",Andrés Rodríguez‐Pose,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/rsp3.12277,Political science,London School of Economics and Political Science,"London School of Economics, London, UK","London School of Economics, London, UK"

America's Churning Races: Race and Ethnic Response Changes between Census 2000 and the 2010 Census,"Race and ethnicity responses can change over time and across contexts – a component of population change not usually taken into account. To what extent do race and/or Hispanic origin responses change? Is change more common to/from some race/ethnic groups than others? Does the propensity to change responses vary by characteristics of the individual? To what extent do these changes affect researchers? We use internal Census Bureau data from the 2000 and 2010 censuses in which individuals’ responses have been linked across years. Approximately 9.8 million people (about 6 percent) in our large, non-representative linked data have a different race and/or Hispanic origin response in 2010 than they did in 2000. Several groups experienced considerable fluidity in racial identification: American Indians and Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, and multiple-race response groups, as well as Hispanics when reporting a race. In contrast, race and ethnic responses for single-race non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and Asians were relatively consistent over the decade, as were ethnicity responses by Hispanics. People who change their race and/or Hispanic origin response(s) are doing so in a wide variety of ways, as anticipated by previous research. For example, people’s responses change from multiple races to a single race, from a single race to multiple races, from one single race to another, and some people add or drop a Hispanic response. The inflow of people to each race/Hispanic group is in many cases similar in size to the outflow from the same group, such that cross-sectional data would show a small net change. We find response changes across ages, sexes, regions, and response modes, with variation across groups. Researchers should consider the implications of changing race and Hispanic origin responses when conducting analyses and interpreting results.",CAROLYN LIEBLER; James Noon; Leticia Fernandez; Leticia Fernández; Sharon R.

An outside view: What do observers say about others’ races and Hispanic origins?,"Outsiders’ views of a person’s race or Hispanic origin can impact how she sees herself, how she reports her race and Hispanic origins, and her social and economic experiences. The way outsiders describe non-strangers in terms of their race and Hispanic origin may reveal popular assumptions about which race/Hispanic categories are salient for Americans, which kinds of people are seen as multiracial, and the types of cues people use when identifying another person’s race. We study patterns of observer identification using a unique, large, linked data source with two measures of a person’s race and Hispanic origin. One measure (from Census 2000 or the 2010 Census) was provided by a household respondent and the other (from the other census year) was provided by a census proxy reporter (e.g., a neighbor) who responded on behalf of a non-responsive household. We ask: Does an outsider’s report of a person’s race and Hispanic origin match a household report? We find that in about 90% of our 3.7 million (nonrepresentative) cases, proxy reports of a person’s race and Hispanic origin match responses given by the household in a different census year. Match rates are high for the largest groups: non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and Asians and for Hispanics, though proxies are not very able to replicate the race responses of Hispanics. Matches are much less common for people in smaller groups (American Indian/Alaska Native, Pacific Islander, Some Other Race, and multiracial). We also ask: What predicts a matched response and what predicts a particular unmatched response? We find evidence of the persistence of hypodescent for blacks and hyperdescent for American Indians. Biracial Asian-whites and Pacific Islander-whites are more often seen by others as non-Hispanic white than as people of color. Proxy reporters tend to identify children as multiple race and elders as single race, whether they are or not. The race/Hispanic composition of the tract is more powerfully predictive of a particular unmatched response than are tract-level measures of socioeconomic status; unmatched responses are often consistent with the race/Hispanic characteristics of the neighborhood.",CAROLYN LIEBLER; James Noon; Sonya Rastogi,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xeqne,"Census, Race (biology), Respondent, Proxy (statistics), Pacific islanders, Demography, Ethnic group, Geography, Psychology, Sociology, Gender studies, Population, Political science, Statistics, Mathematics, Anthropology, Law",University of Minnesota; United States Census Bureau; University of Minnesota System,"University of Minnesota; Bureau Center for Administrative Records Research and Applications U.S. Census Bureau Washington, D.C. 20233; University of Minnesota James M.

Cultural Change as Learning: The Evolution of Female Labor Force Participation over a Century,"This paper develops a learning model of cultural change to investigate why women's labor force participation (LFP) and attitudes toward women's work both changed dramatically. In the model, women's beliefs about the long-run payoff from working evolve endogenously via an intergenerational learning process. This process generically generates the data's S-shaped LFP curve and introduces a novel role for wage changes via their effect on the speed of intergenerational learning. The calibrated model does a good job of replicating the evolution of female LFP in the United States over the last 120 years and finds that the new role for wages was quantitatively significant.",Raquel Fernández,,,,,,,,,,,,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.103.1.472,"Economics, Stochastic game, Wage, Work (physics), Labour economics, Process (computing), Demographic economics, Microeconomics, Computer science, Engineering, Mechanical engineering, Operating system",New York University; Center for Economic and Policy Research,"New York University, 19 W. 4th St., 6 FL, New York, NY 10012, CEPR, NBER, IZA, and ESOP.","New York University, 19 W. 4th St., 6 FL, New York, NY 10012, CEPR, NBER, IZA, and ESOP."

"Kinship, Cooperation, and the Evolution of Moral Systems*","Across the social sciences, a key question is how societies manage to enforce cooperative behavior in social dilemmas such as public goods provision or bilateral trade. According to an influential body of theories in psychology, anthropology, and evolutionary biology, the answer is that humans have evolved moral systems: packages of functional psychological and biological mechanisms that regulate economic behavior, including a belief in moralizing gods; moral values; negative reciprocity; and emotions of shame, guilt, and disgust. Based on a stylized model, this article empirically studies the structure and evolution of these moral traits as a function of historical heterogeneity in extended kinship relationships. The evidence shows that societies with a historically tightly knit kinship structure regulate behavior through communal moral values, revenge taking, emotions of external shame, and notions of purity and disgust. In loose kinship societies, on the other hand, cooperation appears to be enforced through universal moral values, internalized guilt, altruistic punishment, and an apparent rise and fall of moralizing religions. These patterns point to the presence of internally consistent but culturally variable functional moral systems. Consistent with the model, the relationship between kinship ties, economic development, and the structure of the mediating moral systems amplified over time.",Benjamin Enke,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjz001,"Kinship, Shame, Disgust, Social psychology, Reciprocity (cultural anthropology), Moral disengagement, Sociology, Psychology, Anthropology, Anger",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,Harvard University and National Bureau of Economic Research,Harvard University and National Bureau of Economic Research

The Role of Financial Aid in Promoting College Access and Success: Research Evidence and Proposals for Reform,"Since the passage of the Higher Education Act of 1965, great progress has been made in increasing college enrollment rates for qualified students. But gaps in enrollment and completion by family income have persisted and even widened over time. These gaps are both troubling, given the high returns gained by attending college, and puzzling, given the growing availability of financial aid.

The Role of Social Capital in Financial Development,"To identify the effect of social capital on financial development, we exploit social capital differences within Italy. In high-social-capital areas, households are more likely to use checks, invest less in cash and more in stock, have higher access to institutional credit, and make less use of informal credit. The effect of social capital is stronger where legal enforcement is weaker and among less educated people. These results are not driven by omitted environmental variables, since we show that the behavior of movers is still affected by the level of social capital of the province where they were born.",Luigi Guiso; Luigi Zingales; Paola Sapienza,,,,,,,,,,,,2004.0,https://doi.org/10.1257/0002828041464498,"Social capital, Economics, Enforcement, Financial capital, Exploit, Economic capital, Finance, Demographic economics, Economic growth, Human capital, Political science, Computer security, Computer science, Law",University of Sassari; University of Chicago; Northwestern University; Einaudi Institute for Economics and Finance,"Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208, and CEPR.; Graduate School of Business, University of Chicago, 1101 East 58th Street, Chicago, IL 60637, NBER, and CEPR.; Department of Economics, University of Sassari, Ente L.

Stoking the fires? CO2 emissions and economic growth,"We examine the relationship between economic development and carbon dioxide emissions, a greenhouse gas central to global warming predictions. Estimates derived from global panel data suggest a diminishing marginal propensity to emit (MPE) carbon dioxide as GDP per capita rises. Despite this, global carbon dioxide emissions growth will continue at 1.8 percent per annum for the foreseeable future, a result that is not sensitive to average output growth. Instead, emissions growth continues because output and population will grow most rapidly in lower-income nations with high MPEs.

The Labor Market Effects of Legal Restrictions on Worker Mobility,"We analyze how the legal enforceability of noncompete agreements (NCAs) affects labor markets.Using newly-constructed panel data, we find that higher NCA enforceability diminishes workers' earnings and job mobility, with larger effects among workers most likely to sign NCAs.These effects are far-reaching: changes in enforceability impose externalities on workers across state borders, suggesting that enforceability broadly affects labor market dynamism.We provide evidence that NCA enforceability primarily affects wages through its effect on workers' outside options; moreover, workers facing high enforceability are unable to leverage tight labor markets to increase earnings.We motivate these findings by embedding NCA enforceability in a search model with bargaining.Finally, higher NCA enforceability exacerbates gender and racial earnings gaps.",Kurt Lavetti; Matthew Johnson; Matthew S.

Underemployment in the United States and Europe,"The authors produce estimates for a new and better rate of underemployment for 25 countries using the European Labor Force Survey that is based on workers’ reports of their preferred hours at the going wage. Both voluntary and involuntary part-time workers report they want more hours. Full-time workers who say they want to change their hours, mostly say they want to reduce them. When the Great Recession hit, the number of hours of those who said they wanted more hours increased, and the number of hours of those who said they wanted fewer hours decreased. The percentage of workers in both categories remains elevated. The authors provide evidence for the United Kingdom and the United States as well as from an international sample that underemployment lowers pay in the years after the Great Recession, but the unemployment rate does not. They also find evidence for the United States that decreases in the home ownership rate have helped to keep wage pressure in check.

"Corporate Hiring under COVID-19: Labor Market Concentration, Downskilling, and Income Inequality","Big data on job-vacancy postings reveal several dimensions of the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. job market.Firms have cut back on postings for high-skill jobs more than for low-skill jobs, with small firms nearly halting their new hiring altogether.New-hiring cuts and downskilling are most pronounced in local labor markets lacking depth (where employment is concentrated within a few firms), in low-income areas, and in areas with greater income inequality.Cuts are deeper in industries where workers are more unionized and in the non-tradable sector.Access to finance modulates corporate hiring, with credit-constrained firms curtailing their job postings the most.Our study shows how the early-2020 global pandemic is shaping the dynamics of hiring, identifying the firms, jobs, places, industries, and labor markets most affected by it.Our results point to important challenges to the scale and speed of a recovery.",Gaurav Kankanhalli; Murillo Campello; Pradeep Muthukrishnan,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w27208,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Inequality, Labour economics, Economics, Economic inequality, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Mathematics, Internal medicine, Mathematical analysis, Disease, Infectious disease (medical specialty), Medicine",Cornell University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Johnson Graduate School of Management Cornell University 241 Sage Hall, 114 East Avenue Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Johnson Graduate School of Management Cornell University 114 East Avenue 369 Sage Hall Ithaca, NY 14853-6201; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Johnson Graduate School of Management Cornell University 241 Sage Hall, 114 East Avenue Ithaca, NY 14853","Johnson Graduate School of Management Cornell University 241 Sage Hall, 114 East Avenue Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Johnson Graduate School of Management Cornell University 114 East Avenue 369 Sage Hall Ithaca, NY 14853-6201; Johnson Graduate School of Management Cornell University 241 Sage Hall, 114 East Avenue Ithaca, NY 14853"
"Inflation Dynamics: Dead, Dormant, or Determined Abroad?","Inflation dynamics have been difficult to explain over the last decade. This paper explores whether a more comprehensive treatment of globalization can help. CPI inflation has become more synchronized around the world since the 2008 crisis, but core and wage inflation have become less synchronized. Global factors (including commodity prices, world slack, exchange rates, and global value chains) are significant drivers of CPI inflation in a cross-section of countries, and their role has increased over the last decade, particularly the role of nonfuel commodity prices. These global factors, however, do less to improve our understanding of core and wage inflation. Key results are robust to using a less-structured trend-cycle decomposition instead of a Phillips curve framework, with the set of global variables more important for understanding the cyclical component of inflation over the last decade but not the underlying slow-moving inflation trend. Domestic slack still plays a role for all the inflation measures, although globalization has caused some ""flattening"" of this relationship, especially for CPI inflation. Although CPI inflation is increasingly determined abroad, core and wage inflation are still largely domestic processes.",Kristin J.

"Granular Search, Market Structure, and Wages","We develop a model where labor market structure affects the division of surplus between firms and workers.Using Austrian data we show that in more concentrated labor markets, workers are more likely to return to past employers.In our model, the possibility of these re-encounters endows firms with size-based market power since outside options are truly outside the firm: firms do not compete with their own vacancies.Hence, a worker's outside option is worse when bargaining with a larger firm, and wages depend on market structure.The quantified model suggests that such size-based market power could substantially reduce wages.",Gregor Jarosch; Isaac Sorkin; Jan Sebastian Nimczik,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w26239,"Economics, Business",Princeton University; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Department of Economics Stanford University 579 Jane Stanford Way Stanford, CA 94305; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Princeton University 195 Julis Rabinowitz Building Princeton, NJ 08544 and","Department of Economics Stanford University 579 Jane Stanford Way Stanford, CA 94305; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Princeton University 195 Julis Rabinowitz Building Princeton, NJ 08544 and"

Returns to Hedge Fund Activism: An International Study,"This paper provides evidence on the incidence, characteristics, and performance of activist engagements across countries. We find that the incidence of activism is greatest with high institutional ownership, particularly for U.S. institutions. We use a sample of 1,740 activist engagements across 23 countries and find that almost one-quarter of engagements are by multi-activists engaging the same target. These engagements perform strikingly better than single activist engagements. Engagement outcomes, such as board changes and takeovers, vary across countries and significantly contribute to the returns to activism. Japan is an exception, with high initial expectations and low outcomes. Received March 3, 2015; editorial decision December 21, 2016 by Editor Andrew Karolyi.",Hannes F.

Recent Advances in Research on Hedge Fund Activism: Value Creation and Identification,"Hedge fund activism emerged as a major force of corporate governance in the 2000s. By the mid-2000s, there were between 150 and 200 activist hedge funds in action each year, advocating for changes in 200–300 publicly listed companies in the United States. In this article, we review the evolution and major characteristics of hedge fund activism, as well as the short- and long-term impacts of the performance and governance of targeted companies. Though most of the analyses here are based on a comprehensive sample of over 2,000 activism events in the United States from 1994 to 2011, hand-collected by the authors from regulatory filings and news searches, this article covers all major studies on the topic, including those on markets outside of the United States.",Alon Brav; Hyunseob Kim; Wei Jiang,,,,,,,,,,,,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-financial-111914-041751,"Hedge fund, Corporate governance, Accounting, Business, Identification (biology), Value (mathematics), Institutional investor, Political science, Finance, Botany, Machine learning, Computer science, Biology",Columbia University; Duke University; Cornell University; National Bureau of Economic Research," National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); The Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708;;  NBER; Columbia Business School, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027;; Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853;"," National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); The Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708;;  NBER; Columbia Business School, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027;; Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853;"
Do Employees Cheer for Private Equity? The Heterogeneous Effects of Buyouts on Job Quality,"We show that private equity leveraged buyouts (LBOs) reduce perceived job quality despite not impacting average base pay. This appears to reflect higher risk for employees. Both job quality and employee incentive pay are more related to firm performance at private equity-owned companies than at public control firms, with 1% higher deal IRR associated with 0.7% more employee incentive pay. Also, higher leverage deals and employees with worse outside options and longer tenure drive the post-LBO satisfaction declines. Our results highlight how job quality is tied to job security and how ownership affects employees through mechanisms beyond base pay.",Jason Sockin; Liu Xing; Oleg Gredil; Sabrina T Howell; Will Gornall; Xing Liu,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3912230,"Business, Private equity, Incentive, Job security, Leveraged buyout, Private equity firm, Leverage (statistics), Job satisfaction, Labour economics, Club deal, Equity (law), Quality (philosophy), Finance, Economics, Work (physics), Management, Microeconomics, Mechanical engineering, Philosophy, Epistemology, Machine learning, Computer science, Law, Political science, Engineering",Tulane University; National Bureau of Economic Research; New York University; University of British Columbia; California University of Pennsylvania,New York University (NYU) - Leonard N.

Wealth Inequality in the United States since 1913: Evidence from Capitalized Income Tax Data *,"Abstract This paper combines income tax returns with macroeconomic household balance sheets to estimate the distribution of wealth in the United States since 1913. We estimate wealth by capitalizing the incomes reported by individual taxpayers, accounting for assets that do not generate taxable income. We successfully test our capitalization method in three micro datasets where we can observe both income and wealth: the Survey of Consumer Finance, linked estate and income tax returns, and foundations’ tax records. We find that wealth concentration was high in the beginning of the twentieth century, fell from 1929 to 1978, and has continuously increased since then. The top 0.1% wealth share has risen from 7% in 1978 to 22% in 2012, a level almost as high as in 1929. Top wealth-holders are younger today than in the 1960s and earn a higher fraction of the economy’s labor income. The bottom 90% wealth share first increased up to the mid-1980s and then steadily declined. The increase in wealth inequality in recent decades is due to the upsurge of top incomes combined with an increase in saving rate inequality. We explain how our findings can be reconciled with Survey of Consumer Finances and estate tax data.",Emmanuel Saez; Gabriel Zucman,,,,,,,,,,,,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjw004,"Taxable income, Economics, National wealth, Adjusted gross income, Labour economics, Gross income, Inequality, Real estate, State income tax, Capitalization, Wealth elasticity of demand, Economic inequality, Income tax, Distribution (mathematics), Finance, Tax reform, Public economics, Mathematical analysis, Linguistics, Philosophy, Mathematics, Accounting","Berkeley College; University of California, Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research","UC BERKELEY; University of California, Berkeley and National Bureau of Economic Research","UC BERKELEY; University of California, Berkeley and National Bureau of Economic Research"
The Elasticity of Taxable Income with Respect to Marginal Tax Rates: A Critical Review,"This paper critically surveys the large and growing literature estimating the elasticity of taxable income with respect to marginal tax rates using tax return data. First, we provide a theoretical framework showing under what assumptions this elasticity can be used as a sufficient statistic for efficiency and optimal tax analysis. We discuss what other parameters should be estimated when the elasticity is not a sufficient statistic. Second, we discuss conceptually the key issues that arise in the empirical estimation of the elasticity of taxable income using the example of the 1993 top individual income tax rate increase in the United States to illustrate those issues. Third, we provide a critical discussion of selected empirical analyses of the elasticity of taxable income in light of the theoretical and empirical framework we laid out. Finally, we discuss avenues for future research. (JEL H24, H31, J22)",Emmanuel Saez; Joel Slemrod; Seth H Giertz; Seth H.

Optimal Tax Progressivity: An Analytical Framework*,"Abstract What shapes the optimal degree of progressivity of the tax and transfer system? On the one hand, a progressive tax system can counteract inequality in initial conditions and substitute for imperfect private insurance against idiosyncratic earnings risk. On the other hand, progressivity reduces incentives to work and to invest in skills, distortions that are especially costly when the government must finance public goods. We develop a tractable equilibrium model that features all of these trade-offs. The analytical expressions we derive for social welfare deliver a transparent understanding of how preference, technology, and market structure parameters influence the optimal degree of progressivity. A calibration for the U.S. economy indicates that endogenous skill investment, flexible labor supply, and the desire to finance government purchases play quantitatively similar roles in limiting optimal progressivity. In a version of the model where poverty constrains skill investment, optimal progressivity is close to the U.S. value. An empirical analysis on cross-country data offers support to the theory.",Giovanni L.

Boarding a Sinking Ship? An Investigation of Job Applications to Distressed Firms,"ABSTRACT We use novel data from a leading online job search platform to examine the impact of corporate distress on firms’ ability to attract job applicants. Survey responses suggest that job seekers accurately perceive firms’ financial condition, as measured by companies’ credit default swap prices and accounting data. Analyzing responses to job postings by major financial firms during the Great Recession, we find that an increase in an employer's distress results in fewer and lower quality applicants. These effects are particularly evident when the social safety net provides workers with weak protection against unemployment and for positions requiring a college education.",DAVID A. MATSA; David A.

"Outside Purchase Contracts, Human Capital and Firm Capital Structure","We examine the impact of outside purchase contracts on firm risk and firm capital structure.We find that firms with more outside purchase contracts have less risky cash flows.Despite these less risky cash flows, firms with these contracts also have less financial leverage especially when they operate in high value-added industries.Examining firm financing decisions, we document that firms with more outside contracts are more likely to issue private securities.Our results are consistent with firms with more outside purchase contracts using less leverage to decrease the expected costs of financial distress on their explicit and implicit contracting parties.",Gordon Phillips; S.

In this survey we review the theoretical and empirical research on the main mechanisms of corporate control, discuss the main legal and regulatory institutions in different countries, and examine the comparative corporate governance literature.

Practical and economic advantages of choice feeding systems for laying poultry,"Poultry can be managed under different feeding systems, depending on the husbandry skills and the feed available. These systems include the following: (1) a complete dry feed offered as a mash ad libitum; (2) the same feed offered as pellets or crumbles ad libitum; (3) a complete feed with added whole grain; (4) a complete wet feed given once or twice a day; (5) a complete feed offered on a restricted basis; (6) choice feeding. Of all these, an interesting alternative to offering complete diets is choice feeding which can be applied on both a small or large commercial scale. Under choice feeding or ""free-choice feeding"" birds are usually offered a choice between three types of feedstuffs: (a) an energy source (e.g. maize, rice bran, sorghum or wheat); (b) a protein source (e.g. soyabean meal, meat meal, fish meal or coconut meal) plus vitamins and minerals and (c), in the case of laying hens, calcium in granular form (i.e. oyster-shell grit). This system differs from the modern commercial practice of offering a complete diet comprising energy and protein sources, ground and mixed together. Under the complete diet system, birds are mainly only able to exercise their appetite for energy. When the environmental temperature varies, the birds either over- or under-consume protein and calcium. The basic principle behind practising choice feeding with laying hens is that individual hens are able to select from the various feed ingredients on offer and compose their own diet, according to their actual needs and production capacity. A choice-feeding system is of particular importance to small poultry producers in developing countries, such as Indonesia, because it can substantially reduce the cost of feed. The system is flexible and can be constructed in such a way that the various needs of a flock of different breeds, including village chickens, under different climates can be met. The system also offers a more effective way to use home-produced grain, such as maize, and by-products, such as rice bran, in developing countries. Because oyster-shell grit is readily available in developing countries at lower cost than limestone, the use of cheaper oyster-shell grit can further benefit small-holders in these countries. These benefits apart, simpler equipment suffices when designing and building a feed mixer on the farm, and transport costs are lower. If whole (unground) grain is used, the intake of which is accompanied by increased efficiency of feed utilisation, the costs of grinding, mixing and many of the handling procedures associated with mash and pellet preparation are eliminated. The choice feedstuffs can all be offered in the current feed distribution systems, either by mixing the ingredients first or by using a bulk bin divided into three compartments.",J. G. Dingle; J.G.

Innovation and the Enforceability of Noncompete Agreements,"Worker mobility across firms can enhance innovation by spreading knowledge, but such mobility may also hinder innovation by making firms reluctant to invest in R&D.A common way that firms limit workers' mobility is with noncompete agreements (NCAs).We examine how the legal enforceability of NCAs affects innovation, as measured by patenting, using data on every statelevel NCA enforceability change between 1991-2014.We find that making NCAs easier to enforce (""stricter"" enforceability) substantially reduces the rate of patenting: an average-sized increase in NCA enforceability leads a state to have 16-19% fewer citation-weighted patents over the following 10 years.This effect reflects a true loss in innovation rather than a reduction in useless or strategic patents.We then reconcile these findings with contrasting theoretical predictions.Stricter NCA enforceability reduces job mobility and new business formation in innovative industries, suggesting slower knowledge spread.Within publicly-traded firms, stricter NCA enforceability increases investment, but still leads to less innovation, suggesting that any gains from enhanced incentives to invest are more than offset by other ways that NCAs slow down innovation.Finally, using variation in technology classes' exposure to NCA enforceability changes, we show that the economy-wide losses to innovation from strict enforceability are even larger than what our state-level estimates imply.",Alison Pei; Matthew Johnson; Michael Lipsitz,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w31487,"Business, Law and economics, Political science, Economics",Federal Trade Commission; University of Wisconsin–Madison; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Wisconsin Health; Duke University,"Federal Trade Commission; Sanford School of Public Policy Duke University Box #90312 Durham, NC 27708 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Duke University, the University of Maryland, and; Duke University; UW Madison,","Federal Trade Commission; Sanford School of Public Policy Duke University Box #90312 Durham, NC 27708 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Duke University, the University of Maryland, and; Duke University; UW Madison,"
Noncompete Agreements and the Welfare of Consumers,"Employee spinoffs may harm incumbent firm owners for two reasons: first, they increase competition in relevant product markets, potentially decreasing rents associated with market power. Second, the threat of an employee spinoff may prevent a firm owner from making costly, productivity-enhancing investments in their workers. Noncompete agreements (NCAs) solve both problems. From the perspective of a consumer, NCAs may increase prices by decreasing competition, but the investments made by firm owners have the potential to mitigate competitive harms. We develop a model which formally demonstrates this tradeoff to assess the impacts of NCA policy on consumers, and discuss when a ban on NCAs is most likely to be beneficial for consumers. We show that the competitive environment, the nature of investment pass-through, and the benefits of investment play large roles. Counterintuitively, increased benefits of costly investments have the potential to harm consumers, such that industries where NCAs are most important to firms may also be those where harm is greater. Finally, we draw two analogies between NCAs and antitrust (merger analysis and pay-for-delay agreements) and show how insights in those areas may inform NCA policy.",Mark J.

Luppi M. et al.Is pain in patients with haematological malignancies under-recognised? The results from Italian ECAD-O survey.Leuk Res. 2010; 34: e334-e335Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar]. These data reinforce the recommendation that patients with advanced or metastatic cancer require management within an integrated system for palliative care [7.Greco M.T. Roberto A. Corli O. et al.Quality of cancer pain management: an update of a systematic review of undertreatment of patients with cancer.J Clin Oncol. 2014; 32: 4149-4154Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar]. Cancer-related pain may be presented as a major issue of healthcare systems worldwide: ∼14.1 million new cancer cases and 8.2 million deaths occurred worldwide in 2012, based on GLOBOCAN estimates [10.Torre L.A. Bray F. Siegel R.L. et al.Global cancer statistics, 2012.CA Cancer J Clin. 2015; 65: 87-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (20769) Google Scholar] and incidence will be > 15 million in 2020, based on projections [11.Frankish H. 15 million new cancer cases per year by 2020, says WHO.Lancet. 2003; 361: 1278.Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar]. Initial and ongoing assessment of pain should be an integral part of cancer care and indicates when additional comprehensive assessment is needed (Table 2). The regular self-reporting of PI with the help of validated assessment tools is the first step towards effective and individualised treatment. The most frequently used standardised scales [12.Caraceni A. Cherny N. Fainsinger R. et al.Pain measurement tools and methods in clinical research in palliative care: recommendations of an expert working group of the European Association of Palliative Care.J Pain Symptom Manage. 2002; 23: 239-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar] are reported in Figure 1 and are the visual analogue scale (VAS), the verbal rating scale (VRS) and the numerical rating scale (NRS).Table 2Guidelines for the adequate assessment of the patient with pain at any stage of the disease1. Assess and re-assess the pain Causes, onset, type, site, absence/presence of radiating pain, duration, intensity, relief and temporal patterns of the pain, number of BTcPs, pain syndrome, inferred pathophysiology, pain at rest and/or moving Presence of trigger factors and signs and symptoms associated with the pain Presence of relieving factors Use of analgesics and their efficacy and tolerability Description of the pain quality:–Aching, throbbing, pressure: often associated with somatic pain in skin, muscle and bone–Aching, cramping, gnawing, sharp: often associated with visceral pain in organs or viscera–Shooting, sharp, stabbing, tingling, ringing: often associated with NP caused by nerve damage2. Assess and re-assess the patient Clinical situation by means of a complete/specific physical examination and the specific radiological and/or biochemical investigations Interference of pain with the patient's daily activities, work, social life, sleep patterns, appetite, sexual functioning, mood, well-being and coping Impact of the pain, the disease and the therapy on the physical, psychological and social conditions Presence of a caregiver, psychological status, degree of awareness of the disease, anxiety and depression and suicidal ideation, his/her social environment, QoL, spiritual concerns/needs, problems in communication, personality disorders Presence and intensity of signs, physical and/or emotional symptoms associated with cancer pain syndromes Presence of comorbidities (i.e. diabetic, renal and/or hepatic failure, etc.) Functional status Presence of opiophobia or misconception related to pain treatment Alcohol and/or substance abuse3.

Open table in a new tab BTcP, breakthrough cancer pain; NP, neuropathic pain; QoL, quality of life. Assessment of the pain descriptors improves the choice of therapy. Pain can be:(i)Nociceptive: caused by ongoing tissue damage, either somatic (such as bone pain) or visceral (such as gut or hepatic pain); or(ii)Neuropathic: caused by damage or dysfunction in the nervous system, such as in brachial plexopathy or in spinal cord compression by tumour [13.Sun V. Borneman T. Piper B. et al.Barriers to pain assessment and management in cancer survivorship.J Cancer Surviv. 2008; 2: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar]. Most patients with advanced cancer have at least two types of cancer-related pain, resulting from a variety of pathophysiology [14.Portenoy R.K. Koh M. Cancer pain syndromes.in: Bruera E. Portenoy R.K. Cancer Pain. Assessment and Management. 4. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2010: 53-88Google Scholar]. Initial assessment of cancer-related pain for all patients should include:(i)Ask a key screening question, which is not paraphrased and is used consistently. That question should be: 'What has been your worst pain in the last 24 hours on a scale of 0–10?', where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst imaginable [15.Fallon M. Walker J. Colvin L. et al.Pain management in cancer center inpatients: a cluster randomized trial to evaluate a systematic integrated approach-the Edinburgh pain assessment and management tool.J Clin Oncol. 2018; 36: 1284-1290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar].(ii)Monitor if the pain is < 3.(iii)Move to a more detailed assessment if the worst pain is ≥ 3 or if the patient is distressed by pain (as per Table 2). This should also include average pain and pain 'right now'.(iv)Administer appropriate analgesic and reassess both pain and analgesic side effects.(v)Review analgesic regimen if side effects to prescribed analgesics are present and/or pain persists. Recommendation:•The intensity of pain and the treatment outcomes should be assessed regularly and consistently using the VAS or NRS using the question: 'What has been your worst pain in the last 24 hours?' [V, D]. In elderly patients, limited communicative skills and/or cognitive impairment make self-reporting of pain more difficult, although there is no evidence of clinical reduction in pain-related suffering. When cognitive deficits are severe, observation of pain-related behaviours and discomfort (e.g. facial expression, body movements, verbalisation or vocalisations, changes in interpersonal interactions, changes in routine activity) is an alternative strategy for assessing the presence of pain (but not its intensity) [16.van Herk R. van Dijk M. Baar F.P.M. et al.Observational scales for pain assessment in older adults with cognitive impairments or communication difficulties.Nurs Res. 2007; 56: 34-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar]. Observational scales are available [16.van Herk R. van Dijk M. Baar F.P.M. et al.Observational scales for pain assessment in older adults with cognitive impairments or communication difficulties.Nurs Res. 2007; 56: 34-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar]; however, none is validated in different languages. Sensitivity to a light touch can signal neuropathic pain (NP). A detailed appraisal of the literature pertaining to pain assessment in patients with cognitive impairment is outside the scope of this guideline but, given the global challenge and projected increase in dementia, this will become increasingly important [17.Lichtner V. Dowding D. Esterhuizen P. et al.Pain assessment for people with dementia: a systematic review of systematic reviews of pain assessment tools.BMC Geriatr. 2014; 14: 138.Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. Assessment and management of pain in children are not considered in this manuscript, but guidelines have been developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) [18.World Health Organization. WHO Guidelines on the Pharmacological Treatment of Persisting Pain in Children with Medical Illnesses, 2012. www.who.int/medicines/areas/quality_safety/guide_perspainchild/en/ (11 April 2018, date last accessed).Google Scholar]. Recommendation:•Observation of pain-related behaviours and discomfort is indicated in patients with cognitive impairment to assess the presence of pain [V, C]. Psychosocial distress is strongly associated with cancer pain and should be assessed [19.Syrjala K.L. Jensen M.P. Mendoza M.E. et al.Psychological and behavioural approaches to cancer pain management.J Clin Oncol. 2014; 32: 1703-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar]. Psychological distress may amplify pain and similarly, inadequately controlled pain may cause psychological distress [20.Tracey I. Neuroimaging mechanisms in pain: from discovery to translation.Pain. 2017; 158: S115-S122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. Recommendation:•The assessment of all components of suffering, such as psychosocial distress, should be considered and evaluated [II, B]. Patients must be informed about possible onset of pain at any stage of the disease, both during/after diagnostic interventions and as a consequence of cancer and/or anticancer treatments. Patients should be empowered and encouraged to communicate with the physician and/or the nurse about their suffering, the efficacy of therapy and side effects. Patient education should include information on the appropriate use of opioids; this should be set in context with other analgesic and non-pharmacological approaches [21.Reid C.M. Gooberman-Hill R. Hanks G.W. Opioid analgesics for cancer pain: symptom control for the living or comfort for the dying? A qualitative study to investigate the factors influencing the decision to accept morphine for pain caused by cancer.Ann Oncol. 2008; 19: 44-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar]. Patient involvement in pain management improves both communication and pain relief through enhancing both patient understanding and physician assessment and prescribing [22.Bennett M.I. Bagnall A.M. José Closs S. How effective are patient-based educational interventions in the management of cancer pain? Systematic review and meta-analysis.Pain. 2009; 143: 192-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 23.Sheinfeld Gorin S. Krebs P. Badr H. et al.Meta-analysis of psychosocial interventions to reduce pain in patients with cancer.J Clin Oncol. 2012; 30: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar]. It is important to prescribe a therapy that can be managed simply by patients and families themselves. The oral route, if well tolerated, should be considered as the preferred route of administration [24.World Health Organization Cancer Pain Relief.2. World Health Organization, Geneva1996Google Scholar, 25.Hanks G.W. De Conno F. Ripamonti C. et al.Morphine in cancer pain: modes of administration.BMJ. 1996; 312: 823-826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. Breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP), defined as 'a transitory flare of pain that occurs on a background of relatively well-controlled baseline pain', requires careful assessment and appropriate management. Typical BTcP episodes are of moderate to severe intensity, rapid in onset (minutes) and of relatively short duration (median 30 minutes) [26.Portenoy R.K. Hagen N.A. Breakthrough pain: definition, prevalence, and characteristics.Pain. 1990; 41: 273-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar]. Recommendations:•Patients should be informed about pain and pain management and should be encouraged to take an active role in their pain management [II, B].•The onset of pain should be prevented by means of around-the-clock (ATC) administration, taking into account the half-life, bioavailability and duration of action of different drugs [II, B].•Analgesics for chronic pain should be prescribed on a regular basis and not on an 'as required' schedule [V, D].•The oral route of administration of analgesic drugs should be advocated as the first choice [IV, C]. The type and dose of analgesic drugs are influenced by the PI and must be promptly adjusted to reach a balance between optimal pain relief and minimum side effects. Rescue doses [as-needed (prn) doses] should be prescribed proactively for the relief of BTcP pain and to overcome end-of-dose failure. Rescue medication used for end-of-dose failure should help with calculating the daily titration of regular doses. The oral route is preferred except when oral intake is not possible because of severe vomiting, bowel obstruction, severe dysphagia or severe confusion, and in the case of poor pain control which requires rapid dose escalation and/or in the presence of oral opioid-related adverse effects. The WHO proposes a strategy (currently under review) for cancer pain treatment based on a sequential three-step analgesic ladder, from non-opioids to weak opioids to strong opioids, according to PI [24.World Health Organization Cancer Pain Relief.2. World Health Organization, Geneva1996Google Scholar]. The WHO ladder recommends non-opioid analgesics as possible options at all steps; however, this is of greater relevance for the first two steps of the WHO ladder. In practical terms, this means paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (step 1). Opioid analgesics are the mainstay of analgesic therapy and are classified according to ability to control pain from mild to moderate (step 2) to moderate to severe intensity (step 3) [24.World Health Organization Cancer Pain Relief.2. World Health Organization, Geneva1996Google Scholar, 25.Hanks G.W. De Conno F. Ripamonti C. et al.Morphine in cancer pain: modes of administration.BMJ. 1996; 312: 823-826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Portenoy R.K. Hagen N.A. Breakthrough pain: definition, prevalence, and characteristics.Pain. 1990; 41: 273-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar]. However, some authors have suggested eliminating the second step of the analgesic ladder, with weak opioids being replaced with low doses of oral morphine [27.Bandieri E. Romero M. Ripamonti C. et al.Randomized trial of low-dose morphine versus weak opioids in moderate cancer pain.J Clin Oncol. 2016; 34: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28.Fallon M. Do We Need Step 2 of the WHO Pain Ladder—An EAPC Research Network Study. EAPC Abstract Book. EAPC, Madrid2017Google Scholar]. Analgesic drugs are only one part of cancer pain management, and an integrated approach to cancer pain management should be adopted; this should incorporate:(i)primary antitumour treatments;(ii)interventional analgesic therapy and(iii)a variety of non-invasive techniques such as psychological and rehabilitative interventions [29.Paice J.A. Ferrell B. The management of cancer pain.CA Cancer J Clin. 2011; 61: 157-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar]. Paracetamol and NSAIDs are universally accepted as part of the treatment of cancer pain at any stage of the WHO analgesic ladder. Several relevant systematic reviews are available regarding the efficacy of paracetamol and NSAIDs for cancer pain management, either when used alone or in combination with opioids. Paracetamol is the mainstay of the first two steps of the WHO analgesic ladder in many countries. However, a Cochrane systematic review highlights the lack of knowledge about the effectiveness of paracetamol for cancer pain [30.Wiffen P.J. Derry S. Moore R.A. et al.Oral paracetamol (acetaminophen) for cancer pain.Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2017; 7: CD012637PubMed Google Scholar]. In 2017, Cochrane identified 11 studies of oral NSAIDs in adults with cancer pain [31.Derry S. Wiffen P.J. Moore R. et al.Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for cancer pain in adults.Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2017; 12: CD012638Google Scholar]. These included 949 participants; however, no studies examined the effects of NSAIDs together with an opioid (such as morphine), although this is how they are often used. All studies were compromised by small numbers. With any NSAID, moderate or severe cancer pain was reduced to no worse than mild pain in 26%–51% of patients, after 1 or 2 weeks in 4 of the 11 studies. Based on this 2017 Cochrane review, there is no conclusive evidence to support or refute the use of NSAIDs alone or in combination with opioids for the treatment of mild cancer pain. (There is limited evidence that some people with moderate or severe cancer pain can obtain substantial levels of benefit within 1 or 2 weeks.) It is important to monitor and reassess the long-term use of NSAIDs or cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors [32.British National Formulary. BNF 75 March–September 2018, 75th edition. London: British Medical Association and Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain 2018.Google Scholar] because of their significant toxicity (e.g. gastrointestinal bleeding, platelet dysfunction and renal failure). COX-2 selective inhibitors may increase the risk of thrombotic cardiovascular adverse reactions [33.European Medicines Agency. Public statement: European Medicines Agency Announces Regulatory Action on COX-2 Inhibitors (EMEA/62838/2005). www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Public_statement/2009/11/WC500014818.pdf (11 April 2018, date last accessed).Google Scholar] and do not reduce the risk of renal failure. Dipyrone is another non-opioid analgesia that a recent systematic review concluded could be used for the treatment of cancer pain, alone or in combination with opioids [34.Gaertner J. Stamer U.M. Remi C. et al.Metamizole/dipyrone for the relief of cancer pain: a systematic review and evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice.Palliat Med. 2017; 31: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar]. Recommendations:•Analgesic treatment should start with drugs indicated by the WHO analgesic ladder appropriate for the severity of pain [II, B].•There is no significant evidence to support or refute the use of paracetamol alone or in combination with opioids for mild to moderate pain [I, C].•There is no significant evidence to support or refute the use of NSAIDs alone or in combination with opioids for mild to moderate pain [I, C]. There are few options to treat mild to moderate cancer pain before moving to strong opioids such as morphine. Tramadol, dihydrocodeine and codeine are the widely available options. There is widespread use of tramadol in palliative care, even though the data on its use are limited and adverse effects can be severe [27.Bandieri E. Romero M. Ripamonti C. et al.Randomized trial of low-dose morphine versus weak opioids in moderate cancer pain.J Clin Oncol. 2016; 34: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 35.Wiffen P.J. Derry S. Moore R.A. Tramadol with or without paracetamol (acetaminophen) for cancer pain.Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2017; 5: CD012508.PubMed Google Scholar, 36.World Health Organization. WHO Model List of Essential Medicines: 20th WHO Essential Medicines List (EML), March 2017. www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/en/ (11 April 2018, date last accessed).Google Scholar]. Tramadol has a potential role on step 2 of the analgesic ladder, particularly if other step 2 drugs are not tolerated, but adequate studies comparing tramadol with other step 2 drugs (e.g. codeine or dihydrocodeine) are missing. Tramadol can have significant side effects, such as dizziness, nausea, vomiting and constipation [37.Rodriguez R.F. Bravo L.E. Castro F. et al.Incidence of weak opioids adverse events in the management of cancer pain: a double-blind comparative trial.J Palliat Med. 2007; 10: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar]. Tramadol affects serotonin metabolism or availability, potentially leading to serotonin toxicity, particularly in the elderly, and can lower seizure thresholds. Tramadol has a much-reduced analgesic effect in cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) poor metabolisers. Dihydrocodeine is also a substrate for CYP2D6; its partial metabolism is limited in poor metabolisers and is blocked by CYP2D6 inhibitors. However, there is no evidence that such inhibition reduces its analgesic effect. Codeine has no or little analgesic effect until metabolised to morphine, mainly via CYP2D6. In poor metabolisers, it is therefore essentially ineffective, while in ultrarapid metabolisers, it is potentially toxic. The second step of the WHO ladder has several controversial aspects. The first criticism concerns the absence of a definitive proof of efficacy of weak opioids. A meta-analysis of data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) showed no significant difference between the effectiveness of non-opioid analgesics alone and non-opioids in combination with weak opioids [38.Eisenberg E. Berkey C. Carr D.B. et al.Efficacy and safety of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for cancer pain: a meta-analysis.J Clin Oncol. 1994; 12: 2756-2765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. The available studies do not demonstrate a clear difference in the effectiveness of the drugs between the first and the second step [39.Management of cancer pain evidence report technology assessment: number 35–management of cancer pain summary.J Pain Palliat Care Pharmacother. 2002; 16: 91-102Google Scholar]. A 2014 Cochrane review of weak opioids in cancer pain including 15 studies with 721 participants, although providing newer data, was not able to help formulate recommendations [40.Straube C. Derry S. Jackson K.C. et al.Codeine, alone and with paracetamol (acetaminophen), for cancer pain.Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2014; 9: CD006601Google Scholar]. The available evidence indicates that codeine is more effective against cancer pain in adults than placebo, but with increased risk of nausea, vomiting and constipation [41.Larkin P.J. Cherny N.I. La Carpia D. et al.Diagnosis, assessment and management of constipation in advanced cancer: ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines.Annal Oncol. 2018; 29: iv94-iv108Google Scholar]. Work is evolving in the exploration of the place of step 2 in the WHO three-step ladder. Historical work with uncontrolled studies showed that the effectiveness of the second step of the WHO ladder has a time limit of 30–40 days for most patients and that the shift to the third step is mainly due to insufficient analgesia, and 'ceiling effect' with weak opioids, rather than to adverse effects [42.Ventafridda V. Tamburini M. Caraceni A. et al.A validation study of the WHO method for cancer pain relief.Cancer. 1987; 59: 850-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar]. Given the lack of data on effectiveness of tramadol, dihydrocodeine and codeine on cancer pain, many authors have proposed the abolition of the second step of the WHO analgesic ladder, in favour of the early use of morphine at low doses, which is not in the current WHO guideline. The evidence base is evolving, with one study in favour of a low-dose morphine approach already reported and results from another RCT expected shortly [27.Bandieri E. Romero M. Ripamonti C. et al.Randomized trial of low-dose morphine versus weak opioids in moderate cancer pain.J Clin Oncol. 2016; 34: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28.Fallon M. Do We Need Step 2 of the WHO Pain Ladder—An EAPC Research Network Study. EAPC Abstract Book. EAPC, Madrid2017Google Scholar]. Recommendations:•For mild to moderate pain, weak opioids such as tramadol, dihydrocodeine and codeine can be given in combination with non-opioid analgesics [III, C].•As an alternative to weak opioids, low doses of strong opioids could be an option, although this recommendation is not currently part of WHO guidance [II, C].•There is no evidence of increase in adverse effects from the use of low-dose strong opioids instead of the standard step 2 approach with weak opioids [II, C]. Strong opioids are the mainstay of analgesic therapy in treating moderate to severe cancer-related pain. Although a variety of strong opioids exist and there is no superiority of one over another, morphine is the most widely available and prescribed. In spite of the global agreement that access to opioids is essential, both access to and use of opioids remains poor in many countries. Various factors contribute to poor access and use, which is still problematic in Eastern and South Eastern Europe [43.Manjiani D. Paul D.B.

Association between Physician Noncompete Agreements and Healthcare Access,"Introduction: Several states have restricted noncompete agreements (NCAs) for physicians to protect public access to medical services and continuity of patient-physician relationships. However, little is known about the effect of these policies on healthcare access.Methods: We used the U.S. Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Business Database (1976 to 2010) to compare changes in measures of healthcare access, in four states that restricted physician NCAs (intervention group) with corresponding changes in 37 states that continued enforcing NCAs (control group).Results: Relative to the control group, in states that restricted NCAs, the number of practices and practice-locations in a county increased by 3.6% and 3.7%, respectively. Practice employment increased at a rate of 1% per year while the probability of practice closure decreased by 4.9 percentage points. Public Health Implication: Restricting physician NCAs was associated with an increase in the number of practices and practice-locations in a county and a reduction in the likelihood of practice closure and increase in practice employment.",Evan Starr; Mariko Sakakibara; Natarajan Balasubramanian; Seethalakshmi Ramanathan,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4630026,"Health care, Association (psychology), Business, Medicine, Political science, Law, Psychology, Psychotherapist","Syracuse University; SUNY Upstate Medical University; University of California, Los Angeles; Anderson University - South Carolina","State University of New York (SUNY) - SUNY Upstate Medical University; University of Maryland - Robert H.

Beyond Subordination vs. Resistance: An Intersectional Approach to the Agency of Veiled Muslim Women,"Abstract Engaging with a figure that came to operate as a powerful cultural signifier of otherness in debates over migrant/Muslim integration across the West, the 'veiled woman'; the paper questions the idea of agency that inheres in the contemporary feminist discourses on Muslim veil. After showing the shortcomings and adverse effects of two dominant readings of the Muslim veil, as a symbol of women's subordination to men, or as an act of resistance to Western hegemony, it explores an alternative avenue drawing on both the poststructuralist critique of the humanist subject and feminist intersectional theorising to answer the question of what kind of conception of agency can help us to think about the agency of the veiled woman without binding a priori the meaning of her veiling to the teleology of emancipation, whether feminist or anti-imperialist. Keywords: AgencyFeminist DiscoursesIntersectionalityMuslim VeilOrientalism Acknowledgements I thank anonymous reviewers and Ann Denis for their incisive comments. Notes 1. Unlike the women's movements which had to deal, for several decades now, with hegemonic uses of the 'women's question' to legitimise colonial domination and exclusion of racialised minorities from citizenship, for the global LGBT/queer movements the incorporation of their 'cause' and rhetoric into the sexual and racial politics of the Western nationalism and imperialism represents a new political moment. See CitationPuar. 2. Much of the literature uses synonymously veil, hijab and headscarf, which are distinguished from other forms of more covering Islamic dress such as jilbab, niqab and burqa. I conform to this use. 3. One notorious formulation of this antagonistic frame is CitationOkin's 'multiculturalism vs. Feminism'. 4. For a recent questioning of agency in the context of religious submission, see Mack; Hollywood (""Gender""); Avishai; Bracke; and the groundbreaking work of Mahmood, offering an invaluable critique of the conflation of agency with resistance, which remains, unlike the subordination frame, largely uncontested. 5. Alternative Biblical and Quranic reinterpretations proposed by feminist theologians aim precisely to reappropriate religion. 6. For the Habermasian feminist philosopher Seyla Benhabib, feminism cannot afford to adopt the rhetoric of the 'death of the subject' and reject notions such as agency, autonomy and selfhood (Mackenzie and Stoljar 28). Departing from the orthodox humanism relying on the Kantian conception of the subject as independent from the social world, and hence capable of being the sole author of her own actions, Benhabib's liberal approach to agency sees humans as profoundly situated, embedded in social life and discourse which condition their personhood and agency. Yet her situated subject constituted through a complex net of social relations still bears the trace of pre-discursive self (however small), which remains the source of agency (CitationBarvosa-Carter 125). 7. Michèle André, the Secretary of State for Women's Rights declared: ""adolescent girls should not become the object of controversies that are beyond them, and the Republican school should not be submitted to religious pressures of fathers and brothers"" (""Affaire"" 14). 8. From an anthropological perspective, the native/indigenous informant is an intercultural mediator translating her culture for the researcher/outsider, hence the term 'cultural insider'. 9.

I draw here on stimulating conceptualisations by CitationCollins (299), who defines it as ""the overall organization of hierarchical power relations for any society"" having ""(1) a particular arrangement of intersecting systems of oppression, e.g. race, social class, gender […]; and (2) a particular organization of its domains of power, e.g. structural, disciplinary, hegemonic, and interpersonal"". 12. Yet we should remind that the Butlerian approach's capacity to transcend the subordination/resistance frame has been called into question, because of her propensity to read as politically positive resistant/subversive resignification processes, for instance, agencies. See CitationHollywood (""Performativity"" 107) and Mahmood (19–22). 13. CitationPritchard (278) makes a similar claim in her materialist account of 'relative agency'. I prefer the term 'intersectional agency', for I specifically attempt to bring the normative and empirical insights of intersectionality to supplement the poststructuralist conception. 14. As pointed out by CitationMcNay (191), Butler herself acknowledged this lack in her work.

COVID-19 exacerbating inequalities in the US,"COVID-19 does not affect everyone equally. In the US, it is exposing inequities in the health system. Aaron van Dorn, Rebecca E Cooney, and Miriam L Sabin report from New York. In the US, New York City has so far borne the brunt of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with the highest reported number of cases and the highest death toll in the country. The first COVID-19 case in the city was reported on March 1, but community transmission was firmly established on March 7. As of April 14, New York State has tested nearly half a million people, among whom 195 031 have tested positive. In New York City alone, 106 763 people have tested positive and 7349 have died. “New York is the canary in the coal mine. What happens to New York is going to wind up happening to California, and Washington State and Illinois. It's just a matter of time”, said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, while asking for greater federal assistance. The response within New York City, known for its historically strong public health responses, has been to ramp up for the surge, but also to tailor the approach to address some of the most basic touchpoints that could worsen health outcomes, including providing three meals a day to all New York residents in need. Oxiris Barbot, commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene stated, “Our primary focus at this moment has to be on keeping our city's communities safe. This means supporting the public hospitals with supplies; connecting underserved people to free access to care; and delivering health guidance through the trusted voices of community organizations. The COVID-19 pandemic will come to an end eventually, but what is needed afterward is a renewed focus to ensure that health is not a byproduct of privilege. Public health has a fundamental role to play in shaping our future to be more just and equitable.” Confirming existing disparities, within New York City and other urban centres, African American and other communities of colour have been especially affected by the COVID-10 pandemic. Across the country, deaths due to COVID-19 are disproportionately high among African Americans compared with the population overall. In Milwaukee, WI, three quarters of all COVID-19 related deaths are African American, and in St Louis, MO, all but three people who have died as a result of COVID-19 were African American. According to Sharrelle Barber of Drexel University Dornsife School of Public Health (Philadelphia, PA, USA), the pre-existing racial and health inequalities already present in US society are being exacerbated by the pandemic. “Black communities, Latino communities, immigrant communities, Native American communities—we're going to bear the disproportionate brunt of the reckless actions of a government that did not take the proper precautions to mitigate the spread of this disease”, Barber said. “And that's going to be overlaid on top of the existing racial inequalities.” Part of the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on communities of colour has been structural factors that prevent those communities from practicing social distancing. Minority populations in the US disproportionally make up “essential workers” such as retail grocery workers, public transit employees, and health-care workers and custodial staff. “These front-line workers, disproportionately black and brown, then are typically a part of residentially segregated communities”, said Barber. “They don't have that privilege of quote unquote ‘staying at home’, connecting those individuals to the communities they are likely to be a part of because of this legacy of residential segregation, or structural racism in our major cities and most cities in the United States.” The negative consequences of health disparities for people who live in rural areas in the US were already a problem before the pandemic. Underserved African Americans face higher HIV incidence and greater maternal and infant mortality rates. Undocumented Latino communities working in rural industries such as farming, poultry, and meat production often have no health insurance. Poor white communities have been badly hit by the opioid crisis and across rural areas, especially in the southern states, high rates of non-communicable diseases are driven by conditions such as obesity. With higher COVID-19 mortality among those with underlying health conditions, these areas could be hit hard. 14 US states (mostly in the south and the Plains) have refused to accept the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion, leaving millions of the poorest and sickest Americans without access to health care, with the added effect of leaving many regional and local hospitals across the US closed or in danger of closing because of the high cost of medical care and a high proportion of rural uninsured and underinsured people. People with COVID-19 in those states will have poor access to the kind of emergency and intensive care they will need. Native American populations also have disproportionately higher levels of underlying conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes, that would make them particularly at risk of complications from COVID-19. Health care for Native American communities has a unique place in the US. As part of treaty obligations owed by the US government to tribal groups, the Indian Health Service (IHS) provides direct point of care health care for the 2·6 million Native Americans living on tribal reservations. According to the IHS, there are currently 985 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on tribal reservations, and 536 cases in the Navajo Nation alone (the largest reservation). However, the IHS's ability to respond to the crisis might be limited: according to according to Kevin Allis, Chief Executive Officer of the National Congress of American Indians, the largest Native American advocacy organisation, the IHS has only 1257 hospital beds and 36 intensive care units, and many people covered by the IHS are hours away from the nearest IHS facility. The IHS also does not cover care from external providers. Although there is a provision of the CARES Act stimulus bill that is intended to cover those costs, it is unclear how effective it would be if someone covered by the IHS is transferred to a non-IHS facility. The CARES Act also included US$8 billion to supplement the health and economies of Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Even that number was an increase from what President Donald Trump's administration originally wanted. “We knew the White House wanted to give us nothing”, Allis said. “And senate Republicans were okay with a billion and it fine-tuned its way to $8 billion.” But the deep history of injustice by the US government towards these people means that the US response will be looked on with suspicion. At the national level, the response has varied widely by state, with many states that voted for Trump in 2016—notably Florida, Texas, and Georgia—responding to the emerging pandemic later and with more lax measures. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican Trump ally, was slow to implement social-distancing measures and close non-essential businesses, and Georgia Governor Brian Kemp ordered beaches closed by local authorities to be reopened on April 3. However, the trend has not been universal: in Ohio, Republican Governor Mike DeWine was swift in issuing orders to shut non-essential businesses and in responding to the crisis. The federal response has also been overtly political. States with governors that Trump sees as political allies (such as Florida), have received the full measure of requested personal protective equipment from the federal stockpile, while states with governors whom Trump identifies as political enemies (such as New York's Cuomo, Oregon's Jay Inslee, and Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer, all Democrats) have received only a fraction of their requests. Trump has also publicly attacked the responses of those governors on Twitter and during his daily briefings. In distributing funds made available by the CARES Act, Trump also appears to be playing favourites: New York received only a fraction of the $30 billion hospital relief funds from the bill ($12 000 per patient), while other states much more lightly affected received more ($300 000 per patient in Montana and Nebraska, and more than $470 000 per patient in West Virginia, all states that voted for Trump in 2016). Although the numbers of reported cases seem to be levelling off in New York City and other urban areas, perhaps evidence that social-distancing measures are beginning to have an effect, emerging morbidity and mortality data have already clearly demonstrated what many have feared: a pandemic in which the brunt of the effects fall on already vulnerable US populations, and in which the deeply rooted social, racial, and economic health disparities in the country have been laid bare.",Aaron van Dorn; Miriam L Sabin; Miriam Lewis Sabin; Rebecca Cooney; Rebecca E Cooney,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30893-x,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Pandemic, Public health, State (computer science), Death toll, Toll, Mental hygiene, Hygiene, Governor, Political science, Sociology, Mental health, Economic growth, Socioeconomics, Medicine, Disease, Engineering, Nursing, Pathology, Algorithm, Computer science, Economics, Infectious disease (medical specialty), Immunology, Aerospace engineering, Psychiatry",,,

Common Ownership in America: 1980–2017,"We empirically assess the implications of the common ownership hypothesis from a historical perspective using the set of S&amp;P 500 firms from 1980 to 2017. We show that the dramatic rise in common ownership in the time series is driven primarily by the rise of indexing and diversification and, in the cross section, by investor concentration, which the theory presumes to drive a wedge between cash flow rights and control. We also show that the theory predicts incentives for expropriation of undiversified shareholders via tunneling, even in the Berle and Means (1932) world of the widely held firm.

A Theory of Falling Growth and Rising Rents,"Abstract Growth has fallen in the U.S. amid a rise in firm concentration. Market share has shifted to low labour share firms, while within-firm labour shares have actually risen. We propose a theory linking these trends in which the driving force is falling overhead costs of spanning multiple products or a rising efficiency advantage of large firms. In response, the most efficient firms (with higher markups) spread into new product lines, thereby increasing concentration and generating a temporary burst of growth. Eventually, due to greater competition from efficient firms, within-firm markups and incentives to innovate fall. Thus our simple model can generate qualitative patterns in line with the observed trends.",Antonin Bergeaud; Huiyu Li; Peter J Klenow; Peter J.

A Quantitative Theory of the Credit Score,"What is the role of credit scores in credit markets? We argue that it is, in part, the market's assessment of a person's unobservable type, which here we take to be patience. We postulate a model of persistent hidden types where observable actions shape the public assessment of a person's type via Bayesian updating. We show how dynamic reputation can incentivize repayment. Importantly, we show how an economy with credit scores implements the same equilibrium allocation. We estimate the model using both credit market data and the evolution of individuals' credit scores. We conduct counterfactuals to assess how more or less information used in scoring individuals affects outcomes and welfare. If tracking of individual credit actions is outlawed, poor young adults of low type benefit from subsidization by high types despite facing higher interest rates arising from lower dynamic incentives to repay.",Dean Corbae; José-Víctor Ríos-Rull; José-V́ıctor Ŕıos-Rull; Kyle Dempsey; Satyajit Chatterjee,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.3982/ecta18771,"Unobservable, Credit score, Economics, Bond market, Credit rating, Credit history, Welfare, Subsidy, Reputation, Actuarial science, Microeconomics, Econometrics, Monetary economics, Finance, Market economy, Social science, Sociology",University of Wisconsin–Madison; Center for Economic and Policy Research; Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia; University of Pennsylvania; The Ohio State University,"CAERP; Department of Economics, University of Wisconsin-Madison; NBER; Research Department, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia; Department of Economics, The Ohio State University; CAERP; CEPR; Department of Economics, University of Pennsylvania; NBER; UCL","CAERP; Department of Economics, University of Wisconsin-Madison; NBER; Research Department, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia; Department of Economics, The Ohio State University; CAERP; CEPR; Department of Economics, University of Pennsylvania; NBER; UCL"
Changing Income Risk across the US Skill Distribution: Evidence from a Generalized Kalman Filter,"For whom has earnings risk changed, and why? To answer these questions, we develop a filtering method that estimates parameters of an income process and recovers persistent and temporary earnings for every individual at every point in time. Our estimation flexibly allows for first and second moments of shocks to depend upon observables as well as spells of zero earnings (i.e., unemployment) and easily integrates into theoretical models. We apply our filter to a unique linkage of 23.5m SSA-CPS records. We first demonstrate that our earnings-based filter successfully captures observable shocks in the SSA-CPS data, such as job switching and layoffs. We then show that despite a decline in overall earnings risk since the 1980s, persistent earnings risk has risen for both employed and unemployed workers, while temporary earnings risk declined. Furthermore, the size of persistent earnings losses associated with full year unemployment has increased by 50%. Using geography, education, and occupation information in the SSA-CPS records, we refute hypotheses related to declining employment prospects among routine and low-skill workers as well as spatial theories related to the decline of the Rust-Belt. We show that rising persistent earnings risk is concentrated among high-skill workers and related to technology adoption. Lastly, we find that rising persistent earnings risk while employed (unemployed) leads to welfare losses equivalent to 1.8% (0.7%) of lifetime consumption, and larger persistent earnings losses while unemployed lead to a 3.3% welfare loss.",J.

Perceived Precautionary Savings Motives: Evidence from FinTech,"We study the spending response of first-time borrowers to an overdraft facility and elicit their preferences, beliefs, and motives through a FinTech application.Users increase their spending permanently, lower their savings rate, and reallocate spending from non-discretionary to discretionary goods.Interestingly, liquid users react more than others but do not tap into negative deposits.The credit line acts as a form of insurance.These results are not fully consistent with models of financial constraints, buffer stock models, or present-bias preferences.We label this channel perceived precautionary savings motives: Liquid users behave as if they faced strong precautionary savings motives even though no observables, including elicited preferences and beliefs, suggest they should.",Christoph Scheuch; Francesco D’Acunto; Michael Weber; Thomas Rauter,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w26817,"Precautionary principle, Business, Economics, Actuarial science, Monetary economics, Ecology, Biology",Vienna University of Economics and Business; University of Chicago; Boston College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Boston College Carroll School of Management; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Vienna Graduate School of Finance Welthandesplatz 1/D4 A-1020 Vienna Austria; School of Business University of Chicago 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue Chicago, IL 60637 and","Boston College Carroll School of Management; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Vienna Graduate School of Finance Welthandesplatz 1/D4 A-1020 Vienna Austria; School of Business University of Chicago 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue Chicago, IL 60637 and"
The Canary in the Coal Decline: Appalachian Household Finance and the Transition from Fossil Fuels,"The energy transition away from fossil fuels, despite its substantial overall climate benefits, presents significant transition risks for communities historically built around the fossil fuel industry. This paper uses the decline in the Appalachian coal industry between 2011 and 2018 to understand how individuals are harmed by a reduction in local fossil fuel extraction activity. We use individual-level credit data and exogenous variation in coal demand from the electricity sector to identify how the coal mining industry’s decline affected the finances of Appalachian households. We find that the decline in demand for coal caused broad-based negative impacts, decreasing credit scores and increasing credit utilization, delinquencies, amounts in third party collections, bankruptcy rates, and the number of individuals with subprime status. These effects were broad based and cannot be explained solely by individuals who lost coal mining jobs. Individuals with the lowest pre-period credit scores were more likely to end up in financial distress and experienced a greater deterioration in credit scores. Quantile regressions show that the drop in credit scores from the coal decline was most pronounced between the 30th and 50th percentiles of the credit score distribution. Our results provide evidence that people living in fossil fuel extraction regions are likely to experience declines in financial well-being from the energy transition even if they do not directly work in the affected industry.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",Brigitte Roth Tran; Erin Troland; Joshua A.

Employer Credit Checks: Poverty Traps versus Matching Efficiency,"We develop a framework to understand pre-employment credit screening through adverse selection in labor and credit markets.Workers differ in an unobservable characteristic that induces a positive correlation between labor productivity and repayment rates in credit markets.Firms therefore prefer to hire workers with good credit because it correlates with high productivity.A poverty trap may arise, in which an unemployed worker with poor credit has a low job finding rate, but cannot improve her credit without a job.In our calibrated economy, this manifests as a large and persistent wage loss from default, equivalent to 2.3% per month over ten years.Banning employer credit checks eliminates the poverty trap, but pools job seekers and reduces matching efficiency: average unemployment duration rises by 13% for the most productive workers after employers are banned from using credit histories to screen potential hires.",Andrew Glover; Dean Corbae,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w25005,"Matching (statistics), Poverty, Economics, Business, Statistics, Mathematics, Economic growth",University of Wisconsin–Madison; University of Colorado Boulder; National Bureau of Economic Research; The University of Texas at Austin; University of Pennsylvania,"Data and Macro Models Group, Texas Monetary Conference, North American; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; University, University of Pennsylvania, Ohio State University, University of Colorado -Boulder,; Department of Economics University of Wisconsin, Madison 1180 Observatory Drive Madison, WI 53706 and; NBER Working Paper No. 25005; Department of Economics University of Texas at Austin","Data and Macro Models Group, Texas Monetary Conference, North American; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; University, University of Pennsylvania, Ohio State University, University of Colorado -Boulder,; NBER Working Paper No. 25005; Department of Economics University of Wisconsin, Madison 1180 Observatory Drive Madison, WI 53706 and; Department of Economics University of Texas at Austin"

"Bad Credit, No Problem? Credit and Labor Market Consequences of Bad Credit Reports","ABSTRACT We study the financial and labor market impacts of bad credit reports. Using difference‐in‐differences variation from the staggered removal of bankruptcy flags, we show that bankruptcy flag removal leads to economically large increases in credit limits and borrowing. Using administrative tax records linked to personal bankruptcy records, we estimate economically small effects of flag removal on employment and earnings outcomes. We rationalize these contrasting results by showing that, conditional on basic observables, “hidden” bankruptcy flags are strongly correlated with adverse credit market outcomes but have no predictive power for measures of job performance.",JAE SONG; Jae Song; NEALE MAHONEY; Neale Mahoney; PAUL GOLDSMITH‐PINKHAM; Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham; WILL DOBBIE; Will Dobbie,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.12954,"Bankruptcy, FLAGS register, Earnings, Credit rating, Flag (linear algebra), Credit history, Bond market, Business, Credit crunch, Economics, Actuarial science, Financial system, Finance, Computer science, Algebra over a field, Operating system, Mathematics, Pure mathematics",Federal Reserve Bank of New York; United States Social Security Administration; Federal Reserve,"Will Dobbie is at the Harvard Kennedy School and NBER.

Second Chance: Life without Student Debt,"We exploit an episode of plausibly-random debt discharge, due to the inability of National Collegiate to prove chain of title, to examine the effects of student debt relief on individual credit and labor market outcomes.We find that borrowers experiencing this debt relief shock reduce their indebtedness by 11%, and number of other delinquent accounts by 24%.After the discharge, we see increases in the borrowers' geographical mobility, probability of changing jobs, and ultimately their income, which increases by about $3000 over a three year period.Although we cannot quantify its costs, these findings speak to the benefits of loan forgiveness in reducing the consequences of debt overhang.",Ankit Kalda; Marco Di Maggio; Vincent Yao,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w25810,"Debt, Student debt, Student life, Economics, Psychology, Business, Computer science, Finance, Library science",Indiana University; Georgia State University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Indiana University - Kelley School of Business - Department of Finance; Georgia State University, J.

The Equilibrium Effects of Information Deletion: Evidence from Consumer Credit Markets,"This paper uses a large-scale natural experiment to study the equilibrium effects of restricting information provision in credit markets. In 2012, Chilean credit bureaus were forced to stop reporting defaults for 21% of the adult population. Using panel data on the universe of bank transactions in Chile combined with the deleted registry information, we implement machine learning techniques to measure changes in the predictions lenders can make about default rates following deletion. Using a difference-in-differences design, we show that individuals exposed to increases in predicted default reduce borrowing by 6.4% following deletion, while those exposed to decreases raise borrowing by 11.8%. In aggregate, deletion reduces borrowing by 3.5%.

Does Increasing Access to Formal Credit Reduce Payday Borrowing?,"The use of high cost ""payday loans"" among subprime borrowers has generated substantial concern among policymakers.This paper provides the first evidence of substitution between ""alternative"" and ""traditional"" credit by exploiting an unexpected positive shock to traditional credit access among payday loan borrowers: the removal of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy flag.We find that the removal of a bankruptcy flag on a credit report results in a sharp increase in access to traditional credit and raises credit scores, credit card limits, and approval rates.However, despite meaningful increases in access to traditional credit, we find no evidence that borrowers reduce their use of payday loans, and our confidence intervals allow us to rule out even very small reductions in payday borrowing.Furthermore, we find evidence that flag removals increase the use of other alternative credit products such as online subprime installment loans.These results indicate that marginally improving access to less expensive formal credit is insufficient to meaningfully shift borrowers away from high cost subprime products.We discuss likely explanations for this including increased marketing of subprime products associated with the flag removal, the imperfect substitutability between cash and credit for low income borrowers, and an insufficiency in the size of the increase in credit access associated with the flag removal.",Cindy Soo; Sarah Miller,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w27783,"Business, Financial system, Chemistry, Monetary economics, Economics",University of Michigan–Ann Arbor; International Paper (United States); Ross School; National Bureau of Economic Research,"NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; University of Michigan, Ross School of Business, 701 Tappan Street, Ann Arbor MI 48109-1234; Ross School of Business University of Michigan 701 Tappan Street Ann Arbor, MI 48109 and; NBER Working Paper No. 27783","NBER Working Paper No. 27783; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; University of Michigan, Ross School of Business, 701 Tappan Street, Ann Arbor MI 48109-1234; Ross School of Business University of Michigan 701 Tappan Street Ann Arbor, MI 48109 and"
Liquidity Affects Job Choice: Evidence from Teach for America*,"Abstract Can access to a few hundred dollars of liquidity affect the career choice of a recent college graduate? In a three-year field experiment with Teach For America (TFA), a prestigious teacher placement program, we randomly increase the financial packages offered to nearly 7,300 potential teachers who requested support for the transition into teaching. The first two years of the experiment reveal that although most applicants do not respond to a marginal $600 of grants or loans, those in the worst financial position respond by joining TFA at higher rates. We continue the experiment into the third year and self-replicate our results. For the highest-need applicants, an extra $600 in loans, $600 in grants, and $1,200 in grants increase the likelihood of joining TFA by 12.2, 11.4, and 17.1 percentage points (or 20.0%, 18.7%, and 28.1%), respectively. Additional grant and loan dollars are equally effective, suggesting a liquidity mechanism. A follow-up survey bolsters the liquidity story and also shows that those drawn into teaching would have otherwise worked in private-sector firms.",Clayton R Featherstone; Clayton R.

The Unintended Consequences of Employer Credit Check Bans for Labor Markets,"Over the last decade, 11 states have restricted employers’ access to the credit reports of job applicants. We document a significant decline in county-level vacancies after these laws were enacted: Job postings fall by 5.5 percent in affected occupations relative to exempt occupations in the same county and the same occupation nationwide. Cross-sectional heterogeneity in the estimated effects suggests that employers use credit reports as signals: Vacancies fall more in counties with a large share of subprime residents, while they fall less in occupations with other commonly available signals.",Andrew Glover; Kristle Cortés; Murat Tasci,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp-201905,"Demographic economics, Unintended consequences, Business, Labour economics, Job loss, Economics, Political science, Economic growth, Law, Unemployment",Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia; UNSW Sydney,"Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Uni-versity of Texas at Austin, University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Stata Empirical Microeconomics Conference, IESE Business School, UNSW Business School, Bos-ton College Business School, Monash Business School, FIRS-Hong Kong, EFA-Mannheim, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia,; University New South Wales","Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Uni-versity of Texas at Austin, University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Stata Empirical Microeconomics Conference, IESE Business School, UNSW Business School, Bos-ton College Business School, Monash Business School, FIRS-Hong Kong, EFA-Mannheim, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia,; University New South Wales"

Do Private Firms Invest Differently than Public Firms? Taking Cues from the Natural Gas Industry,"ABSTRACT We study how listing status affects investment behavior. Theory offers competing hypotheses on how listing‐related frictions affect investment decisions. We use detailed data on 74,670 individual projects in the U.S. natural gas industry to show that private firms respond less than public firms to changes in investment opportunities. Private firms adjust drilling activity for low capital‐intensity investments. However, they do not increase drilling in response to new capital‐intensive growth opportunities. Instead, they sell these projects to public firms. Our evidence suggests that differences in access to external capital are important in explaining the investment behavior of public and private firms.",ERIK P. GILJE; Erik Gilje; JEROME P.

"Corporate Acquisitions, Diversification, and the Firm's Lifecycle","Lifecycle theories of mergers and diversification predict that firms make acquisitions and diversify when their internal growth opportunities become exhausted.Free cash flow theories make similar predictions.In contrast to these theories, we find that the acquisition rate of firms (defined as the number of acquisitions in an IPO cohort-year divided by the number of firms in that cohort-year) follows a u-shape through their lifecycle as public firms, with young and mature firms being equally acquisitive but more so than middle-aged firms.Firms that go public during the merger/IPO wave of the 1990s are significantly more acquisitive early in their public life than firms that go public at other times.Young public firms have a lower acquisition rate of public firms than mature firms, but the opposite is true for acquisitions of private firms and subsidiaries.Strikingly, firms diversify early in their life and there is a 41% chance that a firm's first acquisition is a diversifying acquisition.The stock market reacts more favorably to acquisitions by young firms than to acquisitions by mature firms except for acquisitions of public firms paid for with stock.There is no evidence that the market reacts more adversely to diversifying acquisitions by young firms than to other acquisitions.",Asli Arikan; Asli M.

The Effects of Public and Private Equity Markets on Firm Behavior,"In this article, I review the theoretical and empirical literature on the effects of public and private equity markets on firm behavior, emphasizing the consequences that emerge from disclosure requirements, ownership concentration, and degree of firm standardization. While publicly listed firms benefit from a lower cost of capital, enabling increased focus on commercialization and profitability, they are less suited to pursue long-term risky investments. Privately held firms are better equipped to pursue innovative projects but face a higher cost of capital, which limits their growth. Complementarities between public and private equity markets can mitigate their respective limitations. Innovation in private equity markets supplements commercialization efforts of public firms, and demand for innovation by public firms accelerates entrepreneurial activity in private equity markets. I conclude by discussing directions for future research.",Shai Bernstein,,,,,,,,,,,,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-financial-052021-072939,"Commercialization, Private investment in public equity, Private equity, Equity capital markets, Club deal, Business, Private equity firm, Profitability index, Equity (law), Private equity secondary market, Private equity fund, Finance, Public economics, Industrial organization, Economics, Marketing, Political science, Law",Harvard University Press; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Harvard Business School, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA;; National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA","Harvard Business School, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA;; National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA"
Does Inward Foreign Direct Investment Boost the Productivity of Domestic Firms?,"Are there productivity spillovers from FDI to domestic firms, and, if so, how much should host countries be willing to pay to attract FDI? To examine these questions, we use a plant-level panel covering U.K. manufacturing from 1973 through 1992. Consistent with spillovers, we estimate a robust and significantly positive correlation between a domestic plant's TFP and the foreign-affiliate share of activity in that plant's industry. Typical estimates suggest that a 10-percentage-point increase in foreign presence in a U.K. industry raises the TFP of that industry's domestic plants by about 0.5%. We also use these estimates to calculate the per-job value of these spillovers at about £2,400 in 2000 prices ($4,300). These calculated values appear to be less than per-job incentives governments have granted in recent high-profile cases, in some cases several times less.",Jonathan E Haskel; Jonathan Haskel; Matthew J Slaughter; Matthew J.

"Product Differentiation, Multiproduct Firms, and Estimating the Impact of Trade Liberalization on Productivity","This paper studies whether removing barriers to trade induces efficiency gains for producers. Like almost all empirical work which relies on a production function to recover productivity measures, I do not observe physical output at the firm level. Therefore, it is imperative to control for unobserved prices and demand shocks. I develop an empirical model that combines a demand system with a production function to generate estimates of productivity. I rely on my framework to identify the productivity effects from reduced trade protection in the Belgian textile market. This trade liberalization provides me with observed demand shifters that are used to separate out the associated price, scale, and productivity effects. Using a matched plant–product level data set and detailed quota data, I find that correcting for unobserved prices leads to substantially lower productivity gains. More specifically, abolishing all quota protections increases firm-level productivity by only 2 percent as opposed to 8 percent when relying on standard measures of productivity. My results beg for a serious reevaluation of a long list of empirical studies that document productivity responses to major industry shocks and, in particular, to opening up to trade. My findings imply the need to study the impact of changes in the operating environment on productivity together with market power and prices in one integrated framework. The suggested method and identification strategy are quite general and can be applied whenever it is important to distinguish between revenue productivity and physical productivity.",Jan De Loecker,,,,,,,,,,,,2011.0,https://doi.org/10.3982/ecta7617,"Productivity, Economics, Partial productivity, Revenue, Production (economics), Productivity model, Product (mathematics), Market power, Econometrics, Industrial organization, Microeconomics, Total factor productivity, Macroeconomics, Geometry, Mathematics, Monopoly, Accounting",Princeton University,"An earlier version of this paper was circulated under the title “Product Differentiation, Multi-Product Firms and Structural Estimation of Productivity,” and is a revised version of Chapter 4 of my Ph.D. thesis.

"The More We Die, The More We Sell? A Simple Test of the Home-Market Effect*","The home-market effect, first hypothesized by Linder (1961) and later formalized by Krugman (1980), is the idea that countries with larger demand for some products at home tend to have larger sales of the same products abroad. In this article, we develop a simple test of the home-market effect using detailed drug sales data from the global pharmaceutical industry. The core of our empirical strategy is the observation that a country's exogenous demographic composition can be used as a predictor of the diseases that its inhabitants are most likely to die from and, in turn, the drugs they are most likely to demand. We find that the correlation between predicted home demand and sales abroad is positive and greater than the correlation between predicted home demand and purchases from abroad. In short, countries tend to be net sellers of the drugs they demand the most, as predicted by Linder (1961) and Krugman (1980).",Arnaud Costinot; Dave Donaldson; Heidi Williams; Margaret Kyle,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjz003,"Home market, Test (biology), On demand, Core (optical fiber), Positive correlation, Economics, Supply and demand, Business, Commerce, Demographic economics, Marketing, Microeconomics, Market economy, Medicine, Telecommunications, Engineering, Paleontology, Biology, Internal medicine",ParisTech; National Bureau of Economic Research,"MINES ParisTech and Centre for Economic and Policy Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Centre for Economic and Policy Research, and National Bureau of Economic Research; Masschusetts Institute of Technology and National Bureau of Economic Research","MINES ParisTech and Centre for Economic and Policy Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Centre for Economic and Policy Research, and National Bureau of Economic Research; Masschusetts Institute of Technology and National Bureau of Economic Research"
Financialization and housing: Between globalization and Varieties of Capitalism,"In the literature, one finds various explanations for the rise of financialized capitalism. In the different strands of financialization literature, housing either plays a minor role or is simply seen as one of the bearers of financialization. The relations between housing and financialization are under-researched and under-theorized. This article, first, looks at the rise of housing finance as an integral part of macro-economic policy, and second, at the role of financial globalization in the rise of housing finance. Housing is seen as an absorber of a ‘wall of money’, but the absorption of finance by housing is a very uneven process. Four trajectories of national institutional structures are suggested, and it is discussed how capital flows are absorbed in each of these trajectories. Finally, it is discussed what this tells about the geographies of financialized capitalism, and its relations to debt, housing, mortgage markets and the spatial fix.",Manuel B Aalbers; Manuel B.

Incidence and Price Discrimination: Evidence from Housing Vouchers,"U.S. housing voucher holders pay their landlord a fraction of household income and the government pays the rest, up to a rent ceiling. We study how two types of changes to the rent ceiling affect landlords and tenants. A policy that makes vouchers more generous across a metro area benefits landlords through increased rents, with minimal impact on neighborhood and unit quality. A second policy that indexes rent ceilings to neighborhood rents leads voucher holders to move in higher-quality neighborhoods with lower crime, poverty and unemployment.",Peter Ganong; Robert Collinson,,,,,,,,,,,,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2255799,"Voucher, Incidence (geometry), Economics, Demographic economics, Mathematics, Accounting, Geometry",Wagner College; New York University; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); New York University (NYU) - Robert F.

"Classification of macroinvertebrate communities across drainage basins in Victoria, Australia: consequences of sampling on a broad spatial scale for predictive modelling","Summary 1. Spatial scale may influence the interpretation of environmental gradients that underlie classification and ordination analyses of lotic macroinvertebrate communities. This could have important consequences for the spatial scale over which predictive models derived from these multivariate analyses can be applied. 2. Macroinvertebrate community data (identified to genus or species) from edge and main‐channel habitats were obtained for sites on rivers from 25 of the 29 drainage basins in Victoria. Trends in community similarity were analysed by carrying out separate multivariate analyses on data from the edge habitats (199 sites) and the main‐channel habitats (163 sites). 3. Hierarchical classification (UPGMA) showed that the edge data could be placed into 11 site groups and the main‐channel data into 12 site groups. 4. Ordination analysis (hybrid multidimensional scaling) showed no sharp disjunctions between site groups in either habitat; overlap was frequent. Correlation of the ordination patterns with environmental variables showed that edge communities varied longitudinally within a drainage basin and from the east to the west of Victoria. These two trends were superimposed on one another to form a single gradient on the ordination. The taxon richness of edge communities was also related to the species richness of macrophytes at a site. Main‐channel communities also displayed a longitudinal and a geographic gradient, but these two gradients were uncorrelated on the ordination. 5. Community similarity only weakly reflected geographic proximity in either habitat. A preliminary subdivision of Victoria into a series of biogeographic regions did not match the pattern of distribution of site groups for the edge habitat, illustrating the difficulties of applying to lotic communities a priori regionalizations based on terrestrial features of the landscape. 6. The longitudinal gradients in the two data sets were commonly observed in data gathered at smaller spatial scales in Victoria. The other gradients (geographic, macrophyte), however, were either not consistently repeated or not evident at smaller spatial scales. At small spatial scales (i.e. within a single drainage basin) gradients were related to variables that varied over restricted ranges, e.g. mean particle size of the substratum. 7. Species richness was very variable when plotted against river slope or distance of site from source; both of these are measures of position on the longitudinal gradients. In contrast to suggestions in the literature, species richness did not show a unimodal trend on these gradients, or any other trend. 8.

"No Job, No Money, No Refi: Frictions to Refinancing in a Recession","ABSTRACT We study how employment documentation requirements and out‐of‐pocket closing costs constrain mortgage refinancing. These frictions, which bind most severely during recessions, may significantly inhibit monetary policy pass‐through. To study their effects on refinancing, we exploit a Federal Housing Administration policy change that excluded unemployed borrowers from refinancing and increased others' out‐of‐pocket costs substantially. These changes dramatically reduced refinancing rates, particularly among the likely unemployed and those facing new out‐of‐pocket costs. Our results imply that unemployed and liquidity‐constrained borrowers have a high latent demand for refinancing. Cyclical variation in these factors may therefore affect both the aggregate and distributional consequences of monetary policy.",ANTHONY A.

Measuring state capacity: Theoretical and empirical implications for the study of civil conflict,"This article identifies and addresses key conceptual and measurement issues raised by measures of state capacity in studies of civil conflict. First, it reviews competing definitions and operationalizations of state capacity, focusing specifically on those that emphasize (1) military capacity, (2) bureaucratic administrative capacity, and (3) the quality and coherence of political institutions. Second, it critically assesses these measures on the basis of construct validity, focusing attention on whether they accurately capture the theoretical concept of state capacity, and whether they allow the researcher to differentiate between competing causal mechanisms. Third, it employs principal factor analysis to identify the underlying dimensionality of 15 different operationalizations of state capacity. State capacity is characterized by low dimensionality, with three factors — or dimensions of state capacity — explaining over 90% of the variance in the 15 measures. While the first factor, rational legality, captures bureaucratic and administrative capacity, the second, rentier-autocraticness, and third, neopatrimoniality, capture aspects of state capacity that cut across theoretical categories. The article concludes by suggesting a multivariate approach to modeling state capacity, and that (1) survey measures of bureaucratic quality, and (2) tax capacity are the most theoretically and empirically justified.",Cullen S Hendrix; Cullen S.

"Housing Collateral, Consumption Insurance, and Risk Premia: An Empirical Perspective","ABSTRACT In a model with housing collateral, the ratio of housing wealth to human wealth shifts the conditional distribution of asset prices and consumption growth. A decrease in house prices reduces the collateral value of housing, increases household exposure to idiosyncratic risk, and increases the conditional market price of risk. Using aggregate data for the United States, we find that a decrease in the ratio of housing wealth to human wealth predicts higher returns on stocks. Conditional on this ratio, the covariance of returns with aggregate risk factors explains 80% of the cross‐sectional variation in annual size and book‐to‐market portfolio returns.",HANNO N.

Illegal Use of Loading Bays and Its Impact on the Use of Public Space,"Loading bays are public spaces reserved for the operation of freight vehicles, and it is well known that there are significant problems concerning their use due to non-compliance with existing regulations. Unlawful use of loading bays leads to double parking, or to parking on the pavement or in restricted areas. This article has two objectives: Firstly, the study and analysis of the use of loading bays (type of demand, parking duration, illegal use, etc.), as well as their use according to their morphology. Secondly, the quantitative assessment of the influence of illegal use with regard to the efficient use of public urban space. Illegal use is quantitatively assessed by calculating the number of loading bays that are used inappropriately and the surface area (m2) of public space used incorrectly. In the analysis carried out in the city of Santander (Spain), it can be observed that the urban morphology of loading zones influences their use: The greater the capacity of the loading zone, the less efficient is its use. Moreover, it is observed that the degree of illegal use within loading zones is very high and that illegally excessive parking durations have a greater impact on the use of the ground space than vehicle type.",Borja Alonso; José Luis Moura; Sara Ezquerro,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12155915,"Public space, Transport engineering, Duration (music), Parking space, Space (punctuation), Business, Environmental science, Civil engineering, Environmental planning, Computer science, Engineering, Architectural engineering, Art, Literature, Operating system",Universidad de Cantabria,"Department of Transportation, Universidad de Cantabria, 39005 Santander, Spain; Research Group on Sustainable Mobility and Railways Engineering (SUM + Lab), Universidad de Cantabria, 39005 Santander, Spain; Transport System Research Group (GIST), Universidad de Cantabria, 39005 Santander, Spain","Department of Transportation, Universidad de Cantabria, 39005 Santander, Spain; Research Group on Sustainable Mobility and Railways Engineering (SUM + Lab), Universidad de Cantabria, 39005 Santander, Spain; Transport System Research Group (GIST), Universidad de Cantabria, 39005 Santander, Spain"
WTO Accession and Performance of Chinese Manufacturing Firms,"We examine the effects of trade liberalization in China on the evolution of markups and productivity of manufacturing firms. Although these dimensions of performance cannot be separately identified when firm output is measured by revenue, detailed price deflators make it possible to estimate the average effect of tariff reductions on both. Several novel findings emerge. First, cuts in output tariffs reduce markups, but raise productivity. Second, pro-competitive effects are most important among incumbents, while efficiency gains dominate for new entrants. Third, cuts in input tariffs raise both markups and productivity. We highlight mechanisms that explain these findings in the Chinese context.

Replicating the multinationality‐performance relationship: Is there an S‐curve?,"Research summary: We revisit the empirical relationship between multinationality and performance by attempting to replicate the widely cited S‐shape relationship reported in Lu and Beamish (2004). Using a longitudinal and comprehensive database on the population of U.S. MNCs from 1989 to 2007, we find no evidence of an S‐shaped relationship; nor do we see a moderating effect of intangible assets. Although our results do show a marginally significant U‐shaped association between multinationality and performance for a subsample of manufacturing firms, this relationship disappears once we account for the endogeneity of multinationality. Our study contributes to empirical research on the multinationality‐performance relationship, highlighting the need for caution in generalizing results across countries and the importance of controlling for the endogeneity of multinationality when assessing its effect on performance. Managerial summary: Our study examines the relationship between a firm's multinationality and its performance. In a much‐cited study, Lu and Beamish (2004) found evidence of an S‐shaped relationship—with firm performance first decreasing, then increasing, then decreasing again as firms internationalized—in a sample of Japanese firms from 1986 to 1997. We test for the same relationship across all U.S. MNCs from 1989 to 2007, and find no evidence of an S‐shaped pattern, or indeed, of any effect of multinationality at an aggregate level. Our study thus suggests that the effect of multinationality may vary with firm capabilities and home country environments, and that managers and academics alike should focus on understanding these specifics, rather than searching for a universal effect of multinationality on performance .

"Multi-Product Exporters, Carry-Along Trade and the Margins of Trade","New empirical and theoretical work has highlighted the importance of multi-product firms in international trade flows. We examine multi-product exporters in the small open economy of Belgium, considering their importance and the relationship between the margins of trade and firm productivity, both across firms and within firms over time. In addition, we employ proxies for trade costs to quantify the extensive and intensive margin adjustments of trade. Linking production and export data at the firm-product level, we discover new and, heretofore, unknown facts about multi-product manufacturing exporters. The large majority of Belgian manufacturing firms export products that they do not produce. More than three quarters of the exported products and more than one quarter of export value from Belgian manufacturers are in goods that are not produced by the firm, so-called Carry-Along Trade (CAT). CAT exports are concentrated in the largest and most productive firms and the value of CAT exports responds differently to variation in firm productivity and trade costs than does the export value of goods that the firm produces.",Andrew B.

AGOA Rules: The Intended and Unintended Consequences of Special Fabric Provisions,"Lesotho and other least developed African countries responded impressively to the preferences they were granted under the African Growth and Opportunities Act with a rapid increase in their clothing exports to the US.But this performance has not been accompanied by some of the more dynamic growth benefits that might have been hoped for.In this study we develop the theory and present empirical evidence to demonstrate that these outcomes are the predictable consequences of the manner in which the specific preferences might be expected to work.The MFA (Multi-fiber Arrangement) quotas on US imports of textiles created a favorable environment for low value-added, fabric-intensive clothing production in countries with unused quotas by inducing constrained countries to move into higher quality products.By allowing the least developed African countries to use third country fabrics in their clothing exports to the US, AGOA provided additional implicit effective subsidies to clothing that were multiples of the US tariffs on clothing imports.Taken together, these policies help account for the program's success and demonstrate the importance of other rules of origin in preventing poor countries from taking advantage of other preference programs.But the disappointments can also be attributed to the preferences because they discouraged additional value-addition in assembly and stimulated the use of expensive fabrics that were unlikely to be produced locally.When the MFA was removed, constrained countries such as China moved strongly into precisely the markets in which AGOA countries had specialized.Although AGOA helped the least developed countries withstand this shock, they were nonetheless adversely affected.Preference erosion due to MFN reductions in US clothing tariffs could similarly have particularly severe adverse effects on these countries.",Lawrence Edwards; Robert Lawrence; Robert Z.

"Economic policy uncertainty, intra-industry trade, and China’s mechanical and electrical product exports","Economic policy uncertainty has had an important impact on trade and sustainable economic development. Especially in some specific industries, uncertainty has increased dramatically. The extant related literature mainly analyzes the nexus between uncertainty and trade across different industries and focuses less on a specific industry. Using Chinese customs data on HS 8-digit products over the period of 2000–2013, this paper first investigates the impact of both foreign economic policy uncertainty (EPU) and domestic intra-industry trade on China’s mechanical and electrical product exports to 23 trading partners and applies pooled OLS regressions to conduct an empirical study. This paper finds that EPU has a significant inhibition effect on mechanical and electrical product exports; conversely, intra-industry trade can both significantly promote exports and alleviate the inhibition effect of EPU. In addition, the export impact of EPU varied with different trade patterns. It can significantly inhibit processing exports, while it has no effect on ordinary exports. The results of this paper indicate that in the context of increasing uncertainty, our findings could have far-reaching policy implications for China to build a new development pattern of domestic and international dual circulation.",Dajun Liu; Huiru Yu; Xiugang Zhu,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0290866,"Nexus (standard), Context (archaeology), China, Economics, International trade, Extant taxon, Product (mathematics), International economics, Intra-industry trade, Bilateral trade, Trade barrier, Business, Paleontology, Geometry, Mathematics, Evolutionary biology, Computer science, Political science, Law, Biology, Embedded system",Hefei University of Technology; Bengbu Medical College; Anhui Business College,"School of Economics, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China; School of Economics and Trade, Anhui Finance & Trade Vocational College, Hefei, China; Bengbu Finance Bureau, Bengbu, China","School of Economics, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China; School of Economics and Trade, Anhui Finance & Trade Vocational College, Hefei, China; Bengbu Finance Bureau, Bengbu, China"
Consumer Mobility and the Local Structure of Consumption Industries,"We study local employment, establishment density, and establishment size across industries delivering final consumption, which comprise a substantial fraction of production, shape local amenities, and pay different wages.In a stylized model of consumer mobility, lower industry storability/durability concentrates demand in space, increasing equilibrium employment.Credit card transactions data show that consumer mobility is limited and varies substantially across sectors; moreover, expenditure declines more rapidly with distance in sectors transacted more frequently.Lower storability/durability, proxied by average transaction frequency, increases a sector's local employment via higher establishment density.Variation in consumer mobility is as economically significant as consumers' expenditure shares.",Ferdinando Monte; J.

Powering Up Productivity: The Eﬀects of Electriﬁcation on U.S. Manufacturing,"We use a rich data set at the city-industry level from 1890 to 1940 to identify the impact of electricity on manufacturing industries.We exploit cross-industry variation in energy use intensity before the arrival of electricity combined with geographic variation in proximity to early hydroelectric power plants.Contrary to the existing narrative, we find that labor productivity gains from electricity measured through this strategy were relatively rapid and long-lasting.Cheaper energy thanks to hydroelectricity is partially responsible but firms also appear to have changed their production process relatively quickly.The source of the impact of electricity on productivity varies with the degree of product market structure: in sector-county pairs where the average firm was initially large, productivity increased without significant expansion in employment, while in markets with relatively small firms, both output and employment increased.",Ethan Lewis; Jeanne Lafortune; José Tessada; Martin Fiszbein; Martín Fiszbein,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w28076,"Productivity, Business, Industrial organization, Economics, Agricultural economics, Monetary economics, Economic growth",Bay State College; National Bureau of Economic Research; Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile; Dartmouth College; Boston University,"Department of Economics Boston University 270 Bay State Road Boston, MA 02215 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Dartmouth College 6106 Rockefeller Hall Hanover, NH 03755 and NBER; Instituto de Economia Facultad de Ciencias Economicas y Administration Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile Avda Vicuna Mackenna 4860 Macul, Santiago Chile; Escuela de Administracion Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile Avda Vicuna Mackenna 4860 Macul, Santiago Chile","Department of Economics Boston University 270 Bay State Road Boston, MA 02215 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Dartmouth College 6106 Rockefeller Hall Hanover, NH 03755 and NBER; Instituto de Economia Facultad de Ciencias Economicas y Administration Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile Avda Vicuna Mackenna 4860 Macul, Santiago Chile; Escuela de Administracion Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile Avda Vicuna Mackenna 4860 Macul, Santiago Chile"

"Reallocation, Firm Turnover, and Efficiency: Selection on Productivity or Profitability?","We investigate the nature of selection and productivity growth in industries where we observe producer-level quantities and prices separately. We show there are important differences between revenue and physical productivity. Because physical productivity is inversely correlated with price while revenue productivity is positively correlated with price, previous work linking (revenue-based) productivity to survival confounded the separate and opposing effects of technical efficiency and demand on survival, understating the true impacts of both. Further, we find that young producers charge lower prices than incumbents. Thus the literature understates new producers' productivity advantages and entry's contribution to aggregate productivity growth.

The Real Exchange Rate and Export Growth: Are Services Different?,"No AccessPolicy Research Working Papers6 Nov 2013The Real Exchange Rate and Export Growth: Are Services Different?Authors/Editors: Barry Eichengreen, Poonam GuptaBarry Eichengreen, Poonam Guptahttps://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-6629SectionsAboutPDF (0.7 MB) ToolsAdd to favoritesDownload CitationsTrack Citations ShareFacebookTwitterLinked In Abstract: This paper considers the determinants of exports of modern services and traditional services. It considers the growth of export volumes as well as export surges, that is, the periods of rapid sustained export growth. It asks whether the determinants of export growth rates and export surges differ between merchandise, traditional services, and modern services and whether developing countries are different. It confirm the importance of the real exchange rate for export growth. The paper finds that the effect of the real exchange rate is even stronger for exports of services than for exports of goods and that it is especially strong for exports of modern services. The results suggest that in the course of their development, as developing countries shift from exporting commodities and merchandise to exporting traditional and modern services, appropriate policies toward the real exchange rate become even more important.

Declining Competition and Investment in the U.S.,"The U.S. business sector has under-invested relative to Tobin's Q since the early 2000's.We argue that declining competition is partly responsible for this phenomenon.We use a combination of natural experiments and instrumental variables to establish a causal relationship between competition and investment.Within manufacturing, we show that industry leaders invest and innovate more in response to exogenous changes in Chinese competition.Beyond manufacturing we show that excess entry in the late 1990's, which is orthogonal to demand shocks in the 2000's, predicts higher industry investment given Q.Finally, we provide some evidence that the increase in concentration can be explained by increasing regulations.",Germán Gutiérrez; Thomas Philippon,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w23583,"Competition (biology), Investment (military), Economics, Instrumental variable, Manufacturing, Manufacturing sector, Monetary economics, Phenomenon, Tobin's q, Econometrics, Labour economics, Business, Ecology, Biology, Politics, Political science, Law, Physics, Marketing, Quantum mechanics",New York University; Center for Economic and Policy Research,"New York University; New York University, CEPR and NBER","New York University; New York University, CEPR and NBER"
"Is Automation Labor-Displacing?

Polanyi's Paradox and the Shape of Employment Growth,"In 1966, the philosopher Michael Polanyi observed, ""We can know more than we can tell...The skill of a driver cannot be replaced by a thorough schooling in the theory of the motorcar; the knowledge I have of my own body differs altogether from the knowledge of its physiology.""Polanyi's observation largely predates the computer era, but the paradox he identified-that our tacit knowledge of how the world works often exceeds our explicit understanding-foretells much of the history of computerization over the past five decades.This paper offers a conceptual and empirical overview of this evolution.I begin by sketching the historical thinking about machine displacement of human labor, and then consider the contemporary incarnation of this displacement-labor market polarization, meaning the simultaneous growth of high-education, high-wage and low-education, low-wages jobs-a manifestation of Polanyi's paradox.I discuss both the explanatory power of the polarization phenomenon and some key puzzles that confront it.I then reflect on how recent advances in artificial intelligence and robotics should shape our thinking about the likely trajectory of occupational change and employment growth.A key observation of the paper is that journalists and expert commentators overstate the extent of machine substitution for human labor and ignore the strong complementarities.The challenges to substituting machines for workers in tasks requiring adaptability, common sense, and creativity remain immense.Contemporary computer science seeks to overcome Polanyi's paradox by building machines that learn from human examples, thus inferring the rules that we tacitly apply but do not explicitly understand.",David Autor,,,,,,,,,,,,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w20485,"Economics, Economic geography, Labour economics",Massachusetts Institute of Technology; IZA - Institute of Labor Economics; National Bureau of Economic Research,Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - Department of Economics;  IZA Institute of Labor Economics;  National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER),Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - Department of Economics;  IZA Institute of Labor Economics;  National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)
De-Globalisation? Global Value Chains in the Post-COVID-19 Age,"This paper evaluates the extent to which the world economy has entered a phase of deglobalisation, and it offers some speculative thoughts on the future of global value chains in the post-COVID-19 age.Although the growth of international trade flows relative to that of GDP has slowed down since the Great Recession, this paper finds little systematic evidence indicating that the world economy has already entered an era of de-globalisation.Instead, the observed slowdown in globalisation is a natural sequel to the unsustainable increase in globalisation experienced in the late 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s.I offer a description of the mechanisms leading to that earlier expansionary phase, together with a discussion of why these forces might have run out of steam, and of the extent to which they may be reversible.I conclude that the main challenge for the future of globalisation is institutional and political in nature rather than technological, although new technologies might aggravate the trends in inequality that have created the current political backlash against globalisation.Zooming in on the COVID-19 global pandemic, I similarly conclude that the current health crisis may further darken the future of globalisation if it aggravates policy tensions across countries.",Pol Antràs,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w28115,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Value (mathematics), Globalization, 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Economics, Virology, Statistics, Medicine, Mathematics, Internal medicine, Outbreak, Disease, Infectious disease (medical specialty), Market economy",Harvard University Press; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Department of Economics Harvard University 1805 Cambridge Street Littauer Center 207 Cambridge, MA 02138 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Harvard University","Department of Economics Harvard University 1805 Cambridge Street Littauer Center 207 Cambridge, MA 02138 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Harvard University"
Difference-in-Differences Estimators of Intertemporal Treatment Effects,"We study treatment-effect estimation, with a panel where groups may experience multiple changes of their treatment dose. We make parallel trends assumptions, but do not restrict treatment effect heterogeneity, unlike the linear regressions that have been used in such designs. We extend the event-study approach for binary-and-staggered treatments, by redefining the event as the first time a group's treatment changes. This yields an event-study graph, with reduced-form estimates of the effect of having been exposed to a weakly higher amount of treatment for l periods.

Trade Liberalization and Mortality: Evidence from U.S. Counties,"We investigate the impact of a large economic shock on mortality.We find that counties more exposed to a plausibly exogenous trade liberalization exhibit higher rates of suicide and related causes of death, concentrated among whites, especially white males.These trends are consistent with our finding that more-exposed counties experience relative declines in manufacturing employment, a sector in which whites and males are disproportionately employed.We also examine other causes of death that might be related to labor market disruption and find both positive and negative relationships.More-exposed counties, for example, exhibit lower rates of fatal heart attacks.",Justin Pierce; Justin R.

Foreign Competition and Domestic Innovation: Evidence from U.S. Patents,"Manufacturing accounts for more than three-quarters of U.S. corporate patents. The competitive shock to this sector emanating from China's economic ascent could in theory either augment or stifle U.S. innovation. Using three decades of U.S. patents matched to corporate owners, we quantify how foreign competition affects domestic innovation. Rising import exposure intensifies competitive pressure, reducing sales, profitability, and R&D expenditure at U.S. firms. Accounting for confounding sectoral patenting trends, we find that U.S. patent production declines in sectors facing greater import competition. This adverse effect is larger among initially less profitable and less capital-intensive firms.",David Autor; David Dorn; David H. Autor; Gary P. Pisano; Gordon H.

The Productivity Consequences of Pollution-Induced Migration in China,"Migration and pollution are two defining features of China's impressive growth performance over the last 30 years.In this paper we study the migration response to pollution in Chinese cities, and its consequences for productivity and welfare.We document a robust pattern in which skilled workers emigrate more in response to pollution than the unskilled.Their greater sensitivity to air quality holds up in cross-sectional variation across cities, panel variation with individual fixedeffects, and when instrumenting for pollution using distant power-plants upwind of cities, or thermal inversions that trap pollution.Pollution therefore changes the spatial distribution of skilled and unskilled workers, which results in higher returns to skill in cities that the educated migrate away from.We quantify the loss in aggregate productivity due to this re-sorting by estimating a model of demand and supply of skilled and unskilled workers across Chinese cities. Counterfactual simulations from the estimated model show that reducing pollution would increase productivity through spatial re-sorting by approximately as much as the direct health benefits of clean air.Physical and institutional restrictions on mobility exacerbate welfare losses.People's dislike of pollution explains a substantial portion of the wage gap between cities.",Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak; Gaurav Khanna; Ran Song; Wenquan Liang,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w28401,"Productivity, China, Pollution, Natural resource economics, Environmental science, Economic geography, Geography, Economics, Ecology, Biology, Economic growth, Archaeology","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Hong Kong; Georgetown University; University of California, San Diego; Jinan University; Yale University; Yale-NUS College","Georgetown University, Barcelona UAB, the World Bank,; Yale School of Management 135 Prospect Street Box 208200 New Haven, CT 06520 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Enivornmental Economics; and Urban Economics), Stanford SITE Migration Conference, U Richmond, Cities and Development Conference (Johns Hopkins), Ortygia Business School,; Harvard, CUHK, HKUST (China Summer Institute), Nankai-Yale; Division of Social Science Yale-NUS College 16 #01-220 College Ave West Singapore, 138527; Jinan University No. 601 West Huangpu Road Tianhe District Guangzhou P.R.

Import Competition and the Great U.S. Employment Sag of the 2000s,"Even before the Great Recession, U.S. employment growth was unimpressive. Between 2000 and 2007, the economy gave back the considerable employment gains achieved during the 1990s, with a historic contraction in manufacturing employment being a prime contributor to the slump. We estimate that import competition from China, which surged after 2000, was a major force behind both recent reductions in U.S. manufacturing employment and - through input-output linkages and other general equilibrium channels - weak overall U.S. job growth.

Explaining the Decline in the U.S. Employment-to-Population Ratio: a Review of the Evidence,"This paper first documents trends in employment rates and then reviews what is known about the various factors that have been proposed to explain the decline in the overall employment-to-population ratio between 1999 and 2018.Population aging has had a large effect on the overall employment rate over this period, but within-age-group declines in employment among young and prime age adults also have played a central role.Among the factors whose effects the evidence allows us to quantify, labor demand factors, in particular increased import competition from China and the penetration of robots into the labor market, are the most important drivers of observed within-group declines in employment.Labor supply factors, most notably increased participation in disability insurance programs, have played a less important but not inconsequential role.Increases in the real value of state minimum wages and in the share of individuals with prison records also have contributed modestly to the decline in the aggregate employment rate.In addition to the factors whose effects we roughly quantify, we identify a set of potentially important factors about which the evidence does not yet allow us to draw clear conclusions.These include the challenges associated with arranging child care, improvements in leisure technology, changing social norms, increased use of opioids, the growth in occupational licensing, and declining labor market fluidity.Our evidence-driven ranking of factors should be useful for guiding future discussions about the sources of decline in the aggregate employment-to-population ratio and consequently the likely efficacy of alternative policy approaches to increasing employment rates.",Katharine Abraham; Katharine G.

International Trade and Job Polarization: Evidence at the Worker-Level,"This paper examines the role of international trade for job polarization-the decline in opportunities for mid-wage workers while those for high-and low-wage workers increase.With employer-employee matched data on virtually all workers and firms in Denmark between 1999 and 2009, we show that import competition has caused worker-level adjustments that lead to job polarization.When mid-wage workers adjust to the shock, highly educated and skilled workers end up in high-wage jobs whereas less educated workers end up in low-wage positions.We show that the specific tasks performed by a worker are central in determining trade's impact, and workers performing manual tasks are the ones most affected regardless of how routine or nonroutine these tasks are.Trade lets foreign workers compete against domestic workers, in contrast to technical progress which pits man versus machine country by country.Quantitatively, we find that job polarization through trade-induced worker adjustments is at least as strong as through technical change and offshoring.",Hâle Utar; Wolfgang Keller,,,,,,,,,,,,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w22315,"Polarization (electrochemistry), Business, Labour economics, Demographic economics, Economics, Chemistry, Physical chemistry",University of Colorado Boulder; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Hong Kong; Center for Economic and Policy Research; Grinnell College; Singapore Management University,"Grinnell College Department of Economics HSSC 2342 1220 Park Street Grinnell, IA 50112; Department of Economics University of Colorado, Boulder Boulder, CO 80309-0256 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Hong Kong University, JKU Linz, LSE, ZEW Mannheim, University of Michigan, CESifo Munich, Nankai, NBER SI CRIW, NBER Trade, EIIT Purdue,; AEA (San Francisco), UIBE Beijing, CEPR ERWIT, Cologne,; Singapore Management University, TIGN Montevideo,","Grinnell College Department of Economics HSSC 2342 1220 Park Street Grinnell, IA 50112; Department of Economics University of Colorado, Boulder Boulder, CO 80309-0256 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Hong Kong University, JKU Linz, LSE, ZEW Mannheim, University of Michigan, CESifo Munich, Nankai, NBER SI CRIW, NBER Trade, EIIT Purdue,; AEA (San Francisco), UIBE Beijing, CEPR ERWIT, Cologne,; Singapore Management University, TIGN Montevideo,"
Heterogeneous Globalization: Offshoring and Reorganization,"This paper exploits a unique offshoring survey to show that firms continue domestic production of the same goods they offshore to low-wage countries.This shift towards ""produced-good imports"" coincides with a reallocation of labor from physical production to innovation and technology occupations, and an increase in domestically-produced varieties' unit values.These responses suggest an additional, firm-level benefit of trade liberalization: the opportunity to offshore production of low-quality varieties, thereby freeing up domestic resources for the development, production, and marketing of higher-quality varieties.Firms' reactions also motivate a new offshoring measure -produced-good imports -that is readily observed in most firm-level datasets.",Andrew Bernard; Frederic Warzynski; Frédèric Warzynski; Teresa Fort; Valerie Smeets; Valérie Smeets,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w26854,"Offshoring, Globalization, Business, Economic geography, International trade, Industrial organization, Economics, Outsourcing, Market economy, Marketing",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; National Bureau of Economic Research; Dartmouth College; Aarhus University; Centre for Economic Policy Research,"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Aarhus University, Dept. of Economics and Business Economics;  Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR);  National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Dartmouth College - Tuck School of Business; Dartmouth College - Tuck School of Business","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Aarhus University, Dept. of Economics and Business Economics;  Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR);  National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Dartmouth College - Tuck School of Business; Dartmouth College - Tuck School of Business"

Exporting and Plant-Level Efficiency Gains: It’s in the Measure,"While there is strong evidence that more productive plants select into exporting, the literature has struggled to identify export-related efficiency gains within plants. We show that this is due to the common use of revenue-based productivity measures (TFPR): more efficient producers tend to charge lower prices, leading to a downward bias in TFPR. Using census panels of Chilean, Colombian, and Mexican manufacturing plants, we find sizable efficiency gains after export entry based on efficiency measures that are not affected by output prices. Evidence suggests that a complementarity between exporting and investment in technology is an important driver of these gains.",Alvaro Garcia-Marin; Nico Voigtländer,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1086/701607,"Complementarity (molecular biology), Economics, Productivity, Revenue, Investment (military), Productive efficiency, Efficiency, Monetary economics, Production (economics), Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Statistics, Genetics, Mathematics, Accounting, Estimator, Biology, Politics, Political science, Law","Universidad de Los Andes, Chile; University of Chile; National Bureau of Economic Research","University of California, Los Angeles, National Bureau of Economic Research, and Centre for Economic Policy Research; Universidad de Chile and Universidad de los Andes, Chile","University of California, Los Angeles, National Bureau of Economic Research, and Centre for Economic Policy Research; Universidad de Chile and Universidad de los Andes, Chile"
The Gains from Input Trade with Heterogeneous Importers,"Firms differ substantially in their participation in foreign input markets. We develop a methodology to measure the aggregate effects of input trade that takes such heterogeneity into account. We provide a theoretical result that holds in a variety of settings: the firm-level data on value added and domestic expenditure shares in material spending is sufficient to compute the change in consumer prices due to a shock to the import environment. We characterize the bias of approaches that rely on aggregate statistics. In an application to French data, input trade reduces the prices of manufacturing products by 27 percent.

"Between Dominance and Rising: The Role of Status Considerations in United States’s Hong Kong Policy, 1997–2023","After the 2019 Anti-extradition Amendment Bill Movement, the United States’s Hong Kong policy experienced significant changes. The change is closely related to the escalating rivalry between the United States and China. This article investigates the role of status considerations in the United States’s Hong Kong policy since 1997. The authors introduce entry-level and in-depth interpretive analyses to examine 3 Hong Kong–related legislative acts and 44 reports from the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, which is part of the U.S. Department of State. Wendtian constructivism, status anxiety and prospect theory are introduced to construct a conceptual framework that emphasises status considerations as a key factor in the United States’s Hong Kong policy. The findings indicate that the United States, as a dominant power in the international hierarchy, is likely to experience status anxiety in confronting China’s rise across status dimensions (economic and military capabilities as well as prestige), prompting a more aggressive approach to its China strategy, which will subsequently influence its Hong Kong policy.",Chen Xie; Colin Mianqing Xie; Karl Chee Leong Lee; Khoo Ying Hooi; Roy Anthony Rogers; Ying Hooi Khoo,,,,,,,,,,,,2025.0,https://doi.org/10.1177/00094455251317897,"Dominance (genetics), Political science, China, Economics, Law, Chemistry, Biochemistry, Gene",University of Malaya,"Department of International and Strategic Studies, Faculty of Arts of Social Sciences, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.; Institute of China Studies, Faculty of Arts of Social Sciences, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur Malaysia.","Department of International and Strategic Studies, Faculty of Arts of Social Sciences, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.; Institute of China Studies, Faculty of Arts of Social Sciences, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur Malaysia."

Inflation Strikes Back: The Role of Import Competition and the Labor Market,"U.S. inflation has recently surged, with inflation reaching its highest readings since the early 1980s.We examine the drivers of this rise in inflation, focusing on supply chain disruptions, labor supply constraints, and their interaction.Using a calibrated two-sector New Keynesian DSGE model with multiple factors of production, foreign competition, and endogenous markups, we find that supply chain disruptions combined with a rise in the disutility of work raised inflation by about 2 percentage points in the 2021-22 period.We show that the combined shock increased price inflation in the model by 0.6 percentage point more than it would have risen if the shocks had hit separately.This amplification arises because the joint shock to labor and imported input prices makes substituting between labor and intermediates less effective for domestic firms.Moreover, the simultaneous foreign competition shock allows domestic producers to increase their pass-through into prices without losing market share.We then show that the benefit of aggressive monetary policy in the model depends on the source of the rise in inflation.If the rise in inflation is demand-driven, then aggressive monetary tightening can contain inflation without a recession later.In contrast, aggressive policy can have a large negative effect on the labor market when inflation is driven by supply chain and labor market disruptions.We use aggregate and industry-level data on producer prices, wages, and input prices to provide corroborating evidence for the key amplification channels in the model.",Ayşegül Şahin; Fatih Karahan; Mary Amiti; Sebastian Heise,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w31211,"Competition (biology), Inflation (cosmology), Economics, Monetary economics, Labour economics, Business, Biology, Ecology, Physics, Theoretical physics",The University of Texas at Austin; Federal Reserve Bank of New York; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Federal Reserve Bank of New York Research and Statistics Group 33 Liberty Street New York, NY 10045; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Research Department Federal Reserve Bank of New York 33 Liberty St New York, NY 10045 and; Department of Economics University of Texas at Austin 2225 Speedway Austin, TX 78712 and; 296 Harlingen Rd Belle Mead, NJ 08502","Federal Reserve Bank of New York Research and Statistics Group 33 Liberty Street New York, NY 10045; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Research Department Federal Reserve Bank of New York 33 Liberty St New York, NY 10045 and; Department of Economics University of Texas at Austin 2225 Speedway Austin, TX 78712 and; 296 Harlingen Rd Belle Mead, NJ 08502"

Intermediaries in International Trade: Products and Destinations,"This paper examines the factors that give rise to intermediaries in exporting and explores the implications for trade volumes. Export intermediaries such as wholesalers serve different markets and export different products than manufacturing exporters do. Wholesalers are more prevalent in markets with higher destination-specific fixed costs and focus on products that are less differentiated, have lower contract intensity, and have large sunk entry costs. Aggregate exports to destinations with high shares of indirect exports are less responsive to changes in the real exchange rate than are exports to markets served primarily by direct exporters.",Andrew B.

Do mergers and acquisitions promote trade? Evidence from China,"Many studies have shown that mergers and acquisitions (M&A) raise firms' productivity. Few researches investigate whether exporters can enhance export performance after M&A through higher levels of efficiency. Based on detailed information on M&A activities of Chinese firms, China's customs trade data and National Bureau of Statistics surveys, we investigate the causal effect of M&A on trade performance. In particular, the value and the volume of firm exports, product quality, product scope and the number of export destinations have been examined. We find positive and significant effects of M&A on all the examined indicators of export performance. These findings are generally robust to a variety of robustness checks. We further observe that state-owned firms are the least likely to benefit from M&A. We also obtain evidence that firms benefit more from M&A deals if they are targets or merge with foreign firms. Overall, this paper is to our knowledge the first study that uses micro-level data in multiple industries to examine the relationship between M&A and exports of heterogeneous firms. Our results deepen our understanding of the consequences of M&A by suggesting another potential benefit, and hence provide policy implications for merger regulation.",Jing Yan,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1080/09638199.2018.1451553,"Merge (version control), Mergers and acquisitions, Destinations, China, Business, Export performance, Economies of scope, Robustness (evolution), Industrial organization, Productivity, Economics, International trade, International economics, Monetary economics, Marketing, Economies of scale, Macroeconomics, Finance, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Tourism, Computer science, Political science, Gene, Law, Information retrieval",Central University of Finance and Economics,"The School of International Trade and Economics, Central University of Finance and Economics , Beijing, China","The School of International Trade and Economics, Central University of Finance and Economics , Beijing, China"
Gauging Metropolitan “High-Tech” and “I-Tech” Activity,"In the past few years, a number of new studies have published high-tech rankings of American metropolitan areas that are used by many business consultants and local economic development organizations to advise firms on location strategies. In this article, the authors generate their own rankings based on an occupational definition of “high techness” and compare them with those of four other studies. The results rank larger and older industrial cities, such as Chicago, New York, and even Detroit, higher than many of the smaller places celebrated as high tech, such as Austin. The work demonstrates that the methodology underlying rankings is crucially important to the outcome. By abandoning narrow notions of high tech restricted to maturing technologies in computers, electronics, and telecommunications and instead using science and technology (S&amp;T) occupations as a marker for high tech, it may be possible to tag the innovative potential of emerging sectors, including high-tech services.",Ann Markusen; Daisaku Yamamoto; Greg Schrock; Karen Chapple; Pingkang Yu,,,,,,,,,,,,2004.0,https://doi.org/10.1177/0891242403257948,"Metropolitan area, High tech, Work (physics), Regional science, Business, Marketing, Economic geography, Economics, Sociology, Political science, Engineering, Geography, Law, Mechanical engineering, Archaeology","University of Minnesota System; Federal Reserve Bank of Boston; University of California, Berkeley","University of Minnesota; FEDERAL.

Firm-level variation in common ownership causes variation in managerial incentives and productivity across firms, which leads to intraindustry and intrafirm cross-market variation in prices, output, markups, and market shares that is consistent with empirical evidence. The organizational structure of multiproduct firms and the passivity of common owners determine whether higher prices under common ownership result from higher costs or from higher markups.

How Resilient is Venture-Backed Innovation? Evidence from Four Decades of U.S. Patenting,"By comparing patenting among VC-backed firms to the universe of U.S. patents over the period 1976-2019, we document that while patents led by VC-backed firms are of significantly higher quality and economic importance than the average patent, VC-backed innovation is substantially more procyclical than innovation in the broader economy.This is driven early-stage startups, whose innovation in recessions is relatively less cited, less original, less general, and less related to fundamental science.Our findings are most consistent with frictions in capital supply playing an important role, leading VCs to change their investment focus during downturns towards less innovative startups.",Josh Lerner; Ramana Nanda; Richard Townsend; Sabrina Howell; Sabrina T Howell,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w27150,"Business, Venture capital, Finance","National Bureau of Economic Research; New York University; University of California, San Diego; Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center; Organisation de Coopération et de Développement Economiques","NYU Stern School of Business KMC 9-93 44 West 4th Street New York, NY 10012 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138;  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development; Harvard Business School Rock Center 214 Soldiers Field Boston, MA 02163; Rady School of Management University of California at San Diego 9500 Gilman Drive La Jolla, CA 92093 and; Harvard Business School Rock Center 317 Soldiers Field Boston, MA 02163","NYU Stern School of Business KMC 9-93 44 West 4th Street New York, NY 10012 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138;  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development; Harvard Business School Rock Center 214 Soldiers Field Boston, MA 02163; Rady School of Management University of California at San Diego 9500 Gilman Drive La Jolla, CA 92093 and; Harvard Business School Rock Center 317 Soldiers Field Boston, MA 02163"

We establish that job creation by young firms is stronger in US counties more exposed to IT-intensive banks. We present evidence consistent with banks' IT adoption facilitating entrepreneurship by improving banks' use of hard information, in particular collateral. At the county level, entrepreneurship increases by more in IT-exposed counties when house prices rise.

Why Do Companies Go Public? An Empirical Analysis,"Using a large database of private firms in Italy, we analyze the determinants of initial public offerings (IPOs) by comparing the ex ante and ex post characteristics of IPOs with those of private firms. The likelihood of an IPO is increasing in the company's size and the industry's market‐to‐book ratio. Companies appear to go public not to finance future investments and growth, but to rebalance their accounts after high investment and growth. IPOs are also followed by lower cost of credit and increased turnover in control.",Fabio Panetta; Luigi Zingales; Marco Pagano,,,,,,,,,,,,1998.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/0022-1082.25448,"Initial public offering, Business, Investment (military), Ex-ante, Control (management), Finance, Monetary economics, Economics, Management, Law, Macroeconomics, Politics, Political science",Bank of Italy; University of Chicago; Center for Economic and Policy Research,"University of Chicago, NBER, and CEPR; Università di Salerno and CEPR; Banca d'Italia","University of Chicago, NBER, and CEPR; Università di Salerno and CEPR; Banca d'Italia"
Establishment Age and Wages: Evidence from German Linked Employer-Employee Data,"Research in wage differentials has a long tradition. Prominent reasons why people make more or less money in the labor market include personal characteristics of the employee (e.g., human capital or gender), job characteristics (working conditions demanding compensating wage differentials), and characteristics of the employer (e.g., industry or firm size). An emerging empirical literature suggests that one hitherto overlooked firm characteristic matters, too: Employers which are in business for a longer period of time tend to pay higher wages. Using a unique rich set of linked employer-employee data we present first empirical evidence on this firm age - wage nexus for Germany. We find that older firms pay on average higher wages for workers with the same broadly defined degree of formal qualification. This firm age differential vanishes after controlling for further worker characteristics and other firm characteristics besides age; if anything, younger firms pay more ceteris paribus. These results are in line with findings from a recent study by Brown and Medoff using U.S. data.",Arnd Kölling; Claus Schnabel; Joachim Wagner,,,,,,,,,,,,2002.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.372501,"German, Labour economics, Business, Economics, Demographic economics, Archaeology, History",IZA - Institute of Labor Economics; Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg; Max Planck Society; Berlin School of Economics and Law; Leuphana University of Lüneburg,University of Lueneburg - Institute of Economics; IZA Institute of Labor Economics; University of Erlangen-Nuremberg; Max Planck Society for the Advancement of the Sciences - Max Planck Institute for Economics; Berlin School of Economics and Law,University of Lueneburg - Institute of Economics; IZA Institute of Labor Economics; University of Erlangen-Nuremberg; Max Planck Society for the Advancement of the Sciences - Max Planck Institute for Economics; Berlin School of Economics and Law
The Impact of Money in Politics on Labor and Capital: Evidence from Citizens United V. FEC,"We examine whether corporate money in politics benefits or hurts labor using the 2010 Supreme Court ruling Citizens United, which rendered bans on political election spending unconstitutional. In difference-in-difference analyses, affected states experience increases in both capital and labor income relative to unaffected states. We find evidence consistent with increased political spending spurring political competition and the adoption of pro-growth policies. These policies benefit a broader set of constituents as we find a broad-based increase in labor income. Affected states see increased political turnover and reduced regulatory burdens. The economic effects are stronger among ex-ante politically inactive and younger firms.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",Ana-Maria Tenekedjieva; Greg Buchak; Pat Akey; Tania Babina,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4519243,"Politics, Labour economics, Capital (architecture), Economics, Political science, Law, History, Archaeology",Stanford University; Federal Reserve; National Bureau of Economic Research; European Corporate Governance Institute; University of Toronto; Columbia University; Federal Reserve Board of Governors,"Stanford University Graduate School of Business; University of Toronto - Rotman School of Management; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; European Corporate Governance Institute (ECGI); National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Columbia University - Columbia Business School, Finance","Stanford University Graduate School of Business; University of Toronto - Rotman School of Management; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; European Corporate Governance Institute (ECGI); National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Columbia University - Columbia Business School, Finance"
Earnings inequality and dynamics in the presence of informality: The case of Brazil,"Using rich administrative and household survey data spanning 34 years from 1985 to 2018, we document a series of new facts on earnings inequality and dynamics in a developing country with a large informal sector: Brazil. Since the mid‐1990s, both inequality and volatility of earnings have declined significantly in Brazil's formal sector. Higher‐order moments of the distribution of earnings changes show cyclical movements in Brazil that are similar to those in developed countries like the US. Relative to the formal sector, the informal sector is associated with a significant earnings penalty and higher earnings volatility for identical workers. Earnings changes of workers who switch from formal to informal (from informal to formal) employment are relatively negative (positive) and large in magnitude, dispersed, negatively (positively) skewed, and less leptokurtic. Our results suggest that informal employment is an imperfect insurance mechanism.",Christian Moser; Gustavo Gonzaga; Niklas Engbom; Roberta Olivieri,,,,,,,,,,,,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.3982/qe1855,"Earnings, Informal sector, Inequality, Economics, Imperfect, Volatility (finance), Labour economics, Kurtosis, Demographic economics, Developing country, Distribution (mathematics), Redistribution (election), Econometrics, Economic growth, Finance, Mathematical analysis, Linguistics, Philosophy, Statistics, Mathematics, Politics, Political science, Law",New York University; Columbia University; Center for Economic and Policy Research; Cornell University; Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro,"Department of Economics, Cornell University; CEPR; NBER; Stern School of Business, New York University; UCLS; CEPR; Graduate School of Business, Columbia University; Department of Economics, PUC-Rio","Department of Economics, Cornell University; CEPR; NBER; Stern School of Business, New York University; UCLS; CEPR; Graduate School of Business, Columbia University; Department of Economics, PUC-Rio"
Firm pay dynamics,"We study the nature of firm pay dynamics. To this end, we propose a statistical model that extends the seminal framework by Abowd et al. (1999) to allow for idiosyncratically time-varying firm pay policies. We estimate the model using linked employer–employee data for Sweden from 1985 to 2016. By drawing on detailed firm financials data, we show that firms that become more productive and accumulate capital raise pay, whereas firms lower pay as they add workers. A secular increase in firm-year pay dispersion in Sweden since 1985 is accounted for by greater persistence of firm pay among incumbent firms as well as greater dispersion in firm pay among entrant firms, as opposed to more volatile firm pay.",Christian Moser; Jan Sauermann; Niklas Engbom,,,,,,,,,,,,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2022.01.012,"Dispersion (optics), Economics, Dynamics (music), Labour economics, Capital (architecture), Microeconomics, Business, Physics, Archaeology, Acoustics, Optics, History",Columbia University; New York University; Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy; Centre for Economic Policy Research,"CEPR, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; Columbia University, United States of America; NBER, United States of America; IFAU, Sweden; UCLS, Sweden; IZA, Germany; New York University, United States of America","CEPR, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; Columbia University, United States of America; NBER, United States of America; IFAU, Sweden; UCLS, Sweden; IZA, Germany; New York University, United States of America"
The Influence of Early-Life Economic Shocks on Aging Outcomes: Evidence from the U.S. Great Depression,"We show that earnings over the life cycle and health and productivity around retirement age vary with exposure to economic conditions in early life. Using state-year-level variation from the most severe and prolonged economic downturn in American history – the Great Depression – combined with restricted microdata from the Health and Retirement Study, we find that changes in macroeconomic indicators during the in utero period and early childhood are associated with changes in accumulated earnings, human capital, metabolic syndrome, and physical limitations decades later. After evaluating changes in endogenous fertility responses and mortality rates for Depression-era birth cohorts in the U.S. Census and Vital Statistics Death Records, we conclude that these effects likely represent lower-bound estimates of the true impacts of the economic shock on aging outcomes.

Personality Traits of Entrepreneurs: A Review of Recent Literature,"We review the extensive literature since 2000 on the personality traits of entrepreneurs. We first consider baseline personality traits like the Big-5 model, self-efficacy and innovativeness, locus of control, and the need for achievement. We then consider risk attitudes and goals and aspirations of entrepreneurs. Within each area, we separate studies by the type of entrepreneurial behavior considered: entry into entrepreneurship, performance outcomes, and exit from entrepreneurship. This literature shows common results and many points of disagreement, reflective of the heterogeneous nature of entrepreneurship. We label studies by the type of entrepreneurial population studied (e.g., Main Street vs. those backed by venture capital) to identify interesting and irreducible parts of this heterogeneity, while also identifying places where we anticipate future large-scale research and the growing depth of the field are likely to clarify matters. There are many areas, like how firm performance connects to entrepreneurial personality, that are woefully understudied and ripe for major advances if the appropriate cross-disciplinary ingredients are assembled.",Sari Pekkala Kerr; Tina Xu; William R.

"Innovation, Productivity Dispersion, and Productivity Growth","We examine whether underlying industry innovation dynamics are an important driver of the large dispersion in productivity across firms within narrowly defined sectors.Our hypothesis is that periods of rapid innovation are accompanied by high rates of entry, significant experimentation and, in turn, a high degree of productivity dispersion.Following this experimentation phase, successful innovators and adopters grow while unsuccessful innovators contract and exit yielding productivity growth.We examine the dynamic relationship between entry, productivity dispersion, and productivity growth using a new comprehensive firm-level dataset for the U.S. We find a surge of entry within an industry yields with a lag an increase in productivity dispersion and then after a subsequent lag an increase in productivity growth.These patterns are more pronounced for the High Tech sector where we expect there to be more innovative activities.These patterns change over time suggesting other forces are at work during the post-2000 slowdown in aggregate productivity.",Cheryl Grim; John Haltiwanger; Lucia Foster; Zoltan Wolf; Zoltán Wolf,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w24420,"Productivity, Dispersion (optics), Slowdown, Economics, Labour economics, Industrial organization, Macroeconomics, Economic growth, Physics, Optics","University of Maryland, College Park; United States Census Bureau; National Bureau of Economic Research","Center for Economic Studies Census Bureau Room 5K032 Washington, DC 20233-6300; US Census Bureau Center for Economic Studies 4600 Silver Hill Road Washington, DC 20233; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of Maryland College Park, MD 20742 and","Center for Economic Studies Census Bureau Room 5K032 Washington, DC 20233-6300; US Census Bureau Center for Economic Studies 4600 Silver Hill Road Washington, DC 20233; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of Maryland College Park, MD 20742 and"
Sweat Equity in U.S. Private Business*,"Abstract We develop a theory of sweat equity—the value of business owners’ time and expenses to build customer bases, client lists, and other intangible assets. We discipline the theory using data from U.S. national accounts, business censuses, and brokered sales to estimate a value for sweat equity in the private business sector equal to 1.2 times U.S. GDP, which is about the same magnitude as the value of fixed assets in use in these businesses. For a typical owner, 26% of the sweat equity is transferable through inheritance or sale. The equity values are positively correlated with business incomes and standard measures of markups based on accounting data, but not with owners’ financial assets or standard measures of business total factor productivity. We use our theory to show that abstracting from sweat activity leads to a significant understatement of the effects of lowering business income tax rates on private business activity for both the extensive and intensive margins. Despite finding larger responses, our model’s implied tax elasticities of establishments and owner hours are in line with empirical estimates in the public finance literature. Allowing for financial constraints and superstar firms does not overturn our main findings.",Anmol Bhandari; Ellen R McGrattan; Ellen R.

An Estimated Structural Model of Entrepreneurial Behavior,"Using a rich panel of owner-operated New York dairy farms, we provide new evidence on entrepreneurial behavior. We formulate a dynamic model of farms facing uninsured risks and financial constraints. Farmers derive nonpecuniary benefits from operating their businesses. We estimate the model via simulated minimum distance, matching both production and financial data. We find that financial factors and nonpecuniary benefits are of first-order importance. Collateral constraints and liquidity restrictions inhibit borrowing and the accumulation of capital, especially among high-productivity firms seeking to expand. The nonpecuniary benefits to farming are large and keep small, low-productivity farms in business. Although farmers are risk averse, eliminating uninsured production risk has only modest effects on capital and output.

Failure to Contribute: An Estimate of the Consequences of Non- and Underpayment of Self-Employment Taxes by Independent Contractors and On-Demand Workers on Social Security,"While existing academic and government research has focused on the size, growth trajectory, and labor and tax law implications of independent contractors, freelancers, and workers selling goods and services online and through app-based platforms (the “on-demand” economy), less work has been devoted to quantifying the Social Security implications for the on-demand economy and its workers. Although it is known that self-employed workers have tax compliance and reporting issues, the existing reporting rules applicable to most workers earning income in the on-demand economy substantially increase the likelihood that these taxpayers are failing to contribute to Social Security and Medicare through payment of the self-employment tax (SE tax). As such, this paper sheds light on the Social Security implications of current federal tax rules for independent contractors generally and, in particular, workers earning income through occupations occurring in the on-demand economy by estimating the population and earnings of these workers using the U.S. Census Bureau’s redesigned Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).By analyzing 2014 SIPP data, we identify a population of self-employed, non-employer respondents working outside of a traditional employment relationship (“independent contractors”), as well as individuals working in occupations in the on-demand economy (“on-demand workers”). SIPP data have the potential to capture workers who earn income using on-demand platforms to connect with customers and process payments (“on-platform work”), as well as workers who earn income in occupations occurring in the on-demand economy who do not use on-demand platforms (“off-platform work”).Additionally, with SIPP data, we are able to estimate the income that independent contractors and on-demand workers earned in these employment relationships in 2014. Using Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data on the tax gap, U.S. Treasury Department audit data on underpayment of the SE tax, and survey data on tax compliance by on-demand economy workers and the self-employed, we are able to create an estimate of how much SE tax should have been paid on this income but likely was not. To provide context for our findings, we applied the methodology we developed to estimate the likely underpayment of the SE tax to data published in 2018 by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on the number of independent contractors and on-platform workers in 2017. In addition, using SIPP, we were able to provide supplemental demographic data on independent contractors and the on-demand platform workforce.",C. Bruckner; Caroline Bruckner; Thomas L.

Firm and Worker Dynamics in a Frictional Labor Market,"This paper integrates the classic theory of firm boundaries, through span of control or taste for variety, into a model of the labor market with random matching and on‐the‐job search. Firms choose when to enter and exit, whether to create vacancies or destroy jobs in response to shocks, and Bertrand‐compete to hire and retain workers. Tractability is obtained by proving that, under a parsimonious set of assumptions, all worker and firm decisions are characterized by their joint surplus, which in turn only depends on firm productivity and size. The job ladder in marginal surplus that emerges in equilibrium determines net poaching patterns by firm characteristics that are in line with the data. As frictions vanish, the model converges to a standard competitive model of firm dynamics. The combination of firm dynamics and search frictions allows the model to: (i) quantify the misallocation cost of frictions; (ii) replicate elusive life‐cycle growth profiles of superstar firms; and (iii) make sense of the failure of the job ladder around the Great Recession as a result of the collapse of firm entry.",Adrien Bilal; Giovanni L.

Job gain and job loss dynamics in the truck transportation industry,"Abstract Every year, roughly 27% of all jobs in the truck transportation sector (NAICS 484) are reshuffled across motor carriers as existing carriers grow or shrink, new entrants begin operations, and existing firms exit. We take a first look at job gain and job loss dynamics in truck transportation, with a special emphasis on the roles of carrier age and job gain and loss dynamics in the manufacturing sector, the source for most trucking ton‐miles. In doing so, we draw on and extend theory in both supply chain management and economics. We test our predictions using archival administrative data covering 1995 through 2019 from the Census Bureau's Business Dynamics Statistics program that tracks the universe of truck transportation firms with employees. Results from fitting a series of mixed effects models provide strong evidence that job gain and job loss dynamics at trucking firms decline rapidly as carriers age. We further find these age‐related dynamics are moderated by employment dynamics in the manufacturing sector. Robustness testing shows job gains and losses dynamics in manufacturing are more predictive than the same dynamics in the distribution sector (wholesaling, retailing, and warehousing). We discuss implications of these findings for theory and practice.",Jason Miller; Jason W. Miller; Jonathan Phares; Stephen V.

The Promise and Peril of Entrepreneurship,"A clearer view of entrepreneurship, based on new comprehensive data, that upends what we know about job creation and survival among US startups. Startups create jobs and power economic growth. That's an article of faith in the United States—but, as The Promise and Peril of Entrepreneurship reveals, our faith may be built on shaky ground. Economists Robert Fairlie, Zachary Kroff, Javier Miranda, and Nikolas Zolas—working with Census Bureau microdata—have developed a new data set, the Comprehensive Startup Panel, that tracks job creation and the survival of every startup in the country. In doing so, they recalibrate our understanding of how startups behave in the US economy. Specifically, their work seeks to answer three critical questions: How many jobs does each entrepreneur create? Do those jobs disappear quickly? And how long do entrepreneurial enterprises survive? Job creation and survival rates are, the authors conclude, much lower than those reported by official federal sources. Such discrepancies emerge from the more comprehensive picture drawn from this new data set—a picture that, for instance, highlights the important but understudied differences between employer firms (startups that hire people) and nonemployer firms (startups that do not initially hire people but may do so in later years as they grow). This reframing captures the vast number of businesses that start with no employees, a number largely missing from the statistics underpinning the mythos of the riskiness of entrepreneurship. The book also explores who owns startups—focusing on differences by race and ethnicity.

Monetary Policy and Innovation,"We document that monetary policy has a substantial impact on innovation activities.After a tightening shock of 100 basis points, research and development (R&D) spending declines by about 1 to 3 percent and venture capital (VC) investment declines by about 25 percent in the following 1 to 3 years.Patenting in important technologies, as well as a patent-based aggregate innovation index, declines by up to 9 percent in the following 2 to 4 years.Based on previous estimates of the sensitivity of output to innovation activities, these magnitudes imply that output could be 1 percent lower after another 5 years.Monetary policy can influence innovation activities by changing aggregate demand and correspondingly the profitability of innovation, and by changing financial market conditions.Both channels appear relevant in the data.Our findings suggest that monetary policy may affect the productive capacity of the economy in the longer term, in addition to the well-recognized near-term effects on economic outcomes.",Kaspar Zimmermann; Yueran Ma,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w31698,"Monetary policy, Business, Economics, Monetary economics",Frankfurt School of Finance & Management; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Booth School of Business University of Chicago 5807 S.

Startup Types and Macroeconomic Performance in Europe,"Can policymakers improve macroeconomic performance by encouraging the entry of high-performance startups? To answer this question, we construct a novel and comprehensive data set on 1.3 million startups in ten European countries. We apply cluster analysis to identify distinct startup types and trace their development over time. Three stylized facts transpire. First, we uncover five well-separated startup types that are consistently present across countries, industries, and cohorts. We label these Basic, Large, Capital-intensive, Cash-intensive, and High-leverage. Second, the initial differences between these startup types are persistent. Third, each startup type displays a characteristic life cycle in terms of productivity, employment generation, and exit rates. We feed these empirical results into an agnostic firm dynamics model to quantify how much structural policy could improve macroeconomic performance by shifting the composition of startups. We find that substantial gains in aggregate employment and productivity can be made through policies that benefit high-performance startups (such as large and capital-intensive ones) while discouraging the entry of underperforming firms (such as highly leveraged ones).",Neeltje van Horen; Ralph De Haas; Vincent Sterk,,,,,,,,,,,,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4140934,"Stylized fact, Leverage (statistics), Productivity, Economics, Business, Industrial organization, Macroeconomics, Computer science, Machine learning",KU Leuven; European Bank for Reconstruction and Development; University College London; Bank of England; Centre for Economic Policy Research,KU Leuven; European Bank for Reconstruction and Development; University College London; Bank of England; Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR),KU Leuven; European Bank for Reconstruction and Development; University College London; Bank of England; Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR)

Declining Business Dynamism: What We Know and the Way Forward,"A growing body of evidence indicates that the U.S. economy has become less dynamic in recent years. This trend is evident in declining rates of gross job and worker flows as well as declining rates of entrepreneurship and young firm activity, and the trend is pervasive across industries, regions, and firm size classes. We describe the evidence on these changes in the U.S. economy by reviewing existing research. We then describe new empirical facts about the relationship between establishment-level productivity and employment growth, framing our results in terms of canonical models of firm dynamics and suggesting empirically testable potential explanations.",Javier Miranda; John Haltiwanger; Ron S.

"Inequality in mortality decreased among the young while increasing for older adults, 1990–2010","Many recent studies point to increasing inequality in mortality in the United States over the past 20 years. These studies often use mortality rates in middle and old age. We used poverty level rankings of groups of U.S. counties as a basis for analyzing inequality in mortality for all age groups in 1990, 2000, and 2010. Consistent with previous studies, we found increasing inequality in mortality at older ages. For children and young adults below age 20, however, we found strong mortality improvements that were most pronounced in poorer counties, implying a strong decrease in mortality inequality. These younger cohorts will form the future adult U.S. population, so this research suggests that inequality in old-age mortality is likely to decline.",H. Schwandt; Hannes Schwandt; J.

Valuing the Global Mortality Consequences of Climate Change Accounting for Adaptation Costs and Benefits,"Abstract Using 40 countries’ subnational data, we estimate age-specific mortality-temperature relationships and extrapolate them to countries without data today and into a future with climate change. We uncover a U-shaped relationship where extre6me cold and hot temperatures increase mortality rates, especially for the elderly. Critically, this relationship is flattened by higher incomes and adaptation to local climate. Using a revealed-preference approach to recover unobserved adaptation costs, we estimate that the mean global increase in mortality risk due to climate change, accounting for adaptation benefits and costs, is valued at roughly 3.2% of global GDP in 2100 under a high-emissions scenario. Notably, today’s cold locations are projected to benefit, while today’s poor and hot locations have large projected damages. Finally, our central estimates indicate that the release of an additional ton of CO2 today will cause mortality-related damages of $36.6 under a high-emissions scenario, with an interquartile range accounting for both econometric and climate uncertainty of [−$7.8, $73.0]. These empirically grounded estimates exceed the previous literature’s estimates by an order of magnitude.",Alice Tianbo Zhang; Amir Jina; Andrew Hultgren; Arvid Viaene; Ashwin Rode; Hee Kwon Seo; Ishan Nath; James Rising; Jiacan Yuan; Kelly E McCusker; Kelly E.

Strengthened scientific support for the Endangerment Finding for atmospheric greenhouse gases,"The case for endangerment In 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established the so-called “Endangerment Finding.” This defined a suite of six long-lived greenhouse gases as “air pollution.” Such air pollution was anticipated to represent a danger to the health and welfare of current and future generations. Thus, the EPA has the authority to regulate these gases under the rules of the U.S. Clean Air Act. Duffy et al. provide a comprehensive review of the scientific evidence gathered in the years since then. These findings further support and strengthen the basis of the Endangerment Finding. Thus, a compelling case has been made even more compelling with an enormous body of additional data. Science , this issue p. eaat5982",A. Park Williams; Camille Parmesan; Christopher B.

Disparities in PM <sub>2.5</sub> air pollution in the United States,"Air pollution at any given time is unequally distributed across locations. Average concentrations of fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) have fallen over time. However, we do not know how the spatial distribution of PM2.5 has evolved. Here, we provide early evidence. We combine 36 years of PM2.5 concentrations measured over ~8.6 million grid cells with geographic, economic, and demographic data from ~65,000 U.S. census tracts. We show that differences in PM2.5 between more and less polluted areas declined substantially between 1981 and 2016. However, the most polluted census tracts in 1981 remained the most polluted in 2016. The least polluted census tracts in 1981 remained the least polluted in 2016. The most exposed subpopulations in 1981 remained the most exposed in 2016. Overall, absolute disparities have fallen, but relative disparities persist.",Ian H. Hardman; Ian Hardman; Jay P.

Gray Matters: Fetal Pollution Exposure and Human Capital Formation,"This paper examines the impact of fetal exposure to air pollution on fourth-grade test scores in Santiago, Chile. We rely on comparisons across siblings which address concerns about locational sorting (for nonmovers) and all other time-invariant family characteristics that can lead to endogenous exposure to poor environmental quality. We also exploit data on air quality alerts to help address concerns related to short-run time-varying avoidance behavior, which has been shown to be important in a number of other contexts. We find a strong negative effect from fetal exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and correlated pollutants (like PM10) on math and language skills measured in fourth grade. These effects are economically significant, and our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the 50% reduction in CO in Santiago between 1990 and 2005 increased lifetime earnings by approximately US$100 million per birth cohort.",Christopher Neilson; Joshua Graff Zivin; Matthew Gibson; Prashant Bharadwaj,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1086/691591,"Earnings, Air pollution, Air quality index, Pollution, Pollutant, Demographic economics, Environmental health, Economics, Geography, Medicine, Meteorology, Chemistry, Ecology, Accounting, Organic chemistry, Biology","University of California, San Diego; National Bureau of Economic Research","University of California, San Diego 9500 Gilman Drive, MC 0519 La Jolla, CA 92093-0519; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of California, San Diego 9500 Gilman Drive #0508 La Jolla, CA 92093 and","University of California, San Diego 9500 Gilman Drive, MC 0519 La Jolla, CA 92093-0519; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of California, San Diego 9500 Gilman Drive #0508 La Jolla, CA 92093 and"

New Evidence on Sex Segregation and Sex Differences in Wages from Matched Employee‐Employer Data,"We use new matched employer‐employee data to estimate the contributions of sex segregation and wage differences by sex within occupation, industry, establishment, and occupation‐establishment cells to the overall sex gap in wages. In contrast to earlier data used to study this question, our data cover all industries and occupations across all regions of the United States. We find that segregation of women into lower‐paying occupations, industries, establishments, and occupations within establishments accounts for a sizable fraction of the sex gap in wages. Nonetheless, approximately one‐half of the sex gap in wages remains attributable to the individual's sex.",David Neumark; Judith Hellerstein; Judith K. Hellerstein; Kenneth R.

Conflicting Logics? A Multidimensional View of Industrial and Academic Science,"A growing body of research views industrial and academic science as characterized by conflicting institutional logics. However, other scholars have long claimed that stark differences between the two sectors exist in theory but not in practice. Drawing on both views and the broader organizational literature, we develop a conceptual framework to compare and contrast industrial and academic science along four interdependent dimensions: (1) the nature of work, (2) characteristics of the workplace, (3) characteristics of workers, and (4) the disclosure of research results. We then employ detailed survey data on a sample of more than 5,000 research-active life scientists and physical scientists to examine key aspects of the framework empirically. Our results suggest that the conflicting logics view tends to overstate differences across sectors while ignoring important heterogeneity within sectors. We further advance the understanding of institutional logics by examining the relationships among dimensions of science, including the degree to which differences in the nature of work explain differences in how work is organized and results are disclosed. We discuss directions for future research on the institution of science as well as implications for managers and policy makers concerned with scientific activity within and across sectors.",Henry Sauermann; Paula E.

Relative Pay for Non-Relative Performance: Keeping Up with the Joneses with Optimal Contracts,"We consider a multi-agent contracting setting when agents have ""keeping up with the Joneses"" (KUJ) preferences. Because productivity is affected by common shocks, it is optimal to base pay on performance relative to a benchmark. But when agents and care about how their pay compares to others', relative performance evaluation increases agents' perceived risk. We show that when a single principal (or social planner) can commit to a public contract, the optimal contract hedges the risk of the agent's relative wage without sacrificing efficiency. While output is unchanged, hedging makes the contracts appear inefficient in the sense that performance is inadequately benchmarked. We also show that when there are multiple principals, or the principal is unable to commit, efficiency is undermined. In particular, KUJ effects induce a ""rat race"" in which agents are more productive, but wages increase even more, reducing profits. Renegotiation exacerbates this inefficiency when KUJ effects are weak, but can enhance efficiency when KUJ effects are sufficiently strong. Finally, public disclosure of contracts across firms can cause output to collapse.",Peter M.

The Aggregate Importance of Intermediate Input Substitutability,"We estimate long-run elasticities of substitution between intermediate inputs for Indian manufacturing plants. India's trade liberalization in the early 1990s provides an ideal natural policy experiment, with permanent and heterogeneous tariff reductions inducing changes in relative prices which we use for identification. We find a high degree of substitutability at the plant-level between 8 broad categories of material inputs, significantly above the Cobb-Douglas benchmark of 1. In contrast, we find elasticities less than 1 between energy, materials, and services as well as between value added and intermediates. We embed our elasticities in a general equilibrium model with a rich input-output structure to quantify their importance. Relative to a Cobb-Douglas benchmark, the aggregate gains from trade are 9% larger when intermediate inputs are substitutes, and come hand in hand with 40% more reallocation of labor across sectors. Furthermore, the aggregate gains from closing the India-U.S. TFP gap in any one sector are on average 29% larger with our estimated elasticities; losses from misallocation of intermediate inputs are more than 3 times larger.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",Alessandra Peter; Cian Ruane,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4448284,"Aggregate (composite), Economics, Materials science, Composite material",National Bureau of Economic Research; New York University; University of Toronto; International Monetary Fund; Université de Montréal,"Department of Economics New York University 19 W. 4th Street New York, NY 10012 and; University of Montreal, the University of Toronto Rotman School of Management,; International Monetary Fund 700 19th St NW Washington, DC 20431; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138","Department of Economics New York University 19 W. 4th Street New York, NY 10012 and; International Monetary Fund 700 19th St NW Washington, DC 20431; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; University of Montreal, the University of Toronto Rotman School of Management,"
Is Software Eating the World?,"When explaining the declining labor income share in advanced economies, the macro literature finds that the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is greater than one.However, the vast majority of micro-level estimates shows that capital and labor are complements (elasticity less than one).Using firm-and establishment-level data from Korea, we divide capital into equipment and software, as they may interact with labor in different ways.Our estimation shows that equipment and labor are complements (elasticity 0.6), consistent with other micro-level estimates, but software and labor are substitutes (1.6), a novel finding that helps reconcile the macro vs. micro-literature elasticity discord.As the quality of software improves, labor shares fall within firms because of factor substitution and endogenously rising markups.In addition, production reallocates toward firms that use software more intensively, as they become effectively more productive.Because in the data these firms have higher markups and lower labor shares, the reallocation further raises the aggregate markup and reduces the aggregate labor share.The rise of software accounts for two-thirds of the labor share decline in Korea between 1990 and 2018.The factor substitution and the markup channels are equally important.On the other hand, the falling equipment price plays a minor role, because the factor substitution and the markup channels offset each other.",Sangmin Aum; Yongseok Shin,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w32591,"Computer science, Software, Programming language",Kyung Hee University; Statistics Korea; Washington University in St. Louis; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Department of Economics Washington University in St. Louis One Brookings Drive St. Louis, MO 63130; Regional Data Center of Statistics Korea.; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Kyung Hee University 26 Kyunghee-daero, Dongdaemun-gu Seoul 02447 South Korea","Department of Economics Washington University in St. Louis One Brookings Drive St. Louis, MO 63130; Regional Data Center of Statistics Korea.; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Kyung Hee University 26 Kyunghee-daero, Dongdaemun-gu Seoul 02447 South Korea"
Tax Policy and Local Labor Market Behavior,"Since 2002, the US government has encouraged business investment using accelerated depreciation policies that significantly reduce investment costs. We provide the first in-depth analysis of this stimulus on employment and earnings. Our local labor markets approach exploits cross-industry variation in policy generosity interacted with county-level industry location data. This strategy identifies the partial equilibrium effects of accelerated depreciation. Places that experience larger decreases in investment costs see an increase in employment and earnings. In contrast, the policy does not have positive effects on earnings-per-worker. Overall, our findings suggest federal corporate tax policy has large effects on local labor markets.

"Data, Privacy Laws and Firm Production: Evidence from the GDPR","By regulating how firms collect, store, and use data, privacy laws may change the role of data in production and alter firm demand for information technology inputs. We study how firms respond to privacy laws in the context of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by using seven years of data from a large global cloud-computing provider. Our difference-in-difference estimates indicate that, in response to the GDPR, EU firms decreased data storage by 26% and data processing by 15% relative to comparable US firms, becoming less ""data-intensive."" To estimate the costs of the GDPR for firms, we propose and estimate a production function where data and computation serve as inputs to the production of ""information."" We find that data and computation are strong complements in production and that firm responses are consistent with the GDPR, representing a 20% increase in the cost of data on average. Variation in the firm-level effects of the GDPR and industry-level exposure to data, however, drives significant heterogeneity in our estimates of the impact of the GDPR on production costs.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",D.

The Economic Case for Global Vaccinations: An Epidemiological Model with International Production Networks,"We develop a multi-sector-country model with input-output linkages to study the effects of sectoral demand and supply shocks within the global trade and production network.Using the model, we quantify output losses of advanced economies (AEs) stemming from lack of vaccinations in the emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) during Covid-19.The sectoral shocks for 65 countries and 35 sectors are based on changes in sectoral consumption demand and labor supply as a function of infections.Endogenous lockdowns triggered by lack of vaccinations in EMDEs hurt AEs via a shortage of intermediate inputs, higher import prices, and weak demand for their exports.We provide upper and lower bound estimates for negative output effects of global supply chain disruptions, depending on the degree of complementarity across factors of production.Vaccinating EMDEs is a high return investment for AEs to smooth out the economic impact of the pandemic in their home countries.",Cem Çakmaklı; Muhammed Yıldırım; Selva Demiralp; Sevcan Yeşiltaş; Ṣebnem Kalemli-Özcan; Ṣebnem Kalemli‐Özcan,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w28395,"Production (economics), Epidemiology, Computer science, Economics, Medicine, Macroeconomics, Pathology","University of Maryland, College Park; Koç University; National Bureau of Economic Research","Department of Economics University of Maryland Tydings Hall 4118D College Park, MD 20742-7211; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; NBER Working Paper No. 28395; Koç University College of Administrative Sciences and Economics Rumelifener Yolu Sariyer, Istanbul Turkey; Koc University Rumelifeneri Yolu Sariyer Istanbul 34450 TURKEY; Koç University Rumelifeneri Yolu, Sariyer Istanbul 34450 Turkey","Department of Economics University of Maryland Tydings Hall 4118D College Park, MD 20742-7211; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; NBER Working Paper No. 28395; Koç University College of Administrative Sciences and Economics Rumelifener Yolu Sariyer, Istanbul Turkey; Koc University Rumelifeneri Yolu Sariyer Istanbul 34450 TURKEY; Koç University Rumelifeneri Yolu, Sariyer Istanbul 34450 Turkey"

International Comovement in the Global Production Network,"This paper provides a general framework to study the role of production networks in international GDP comovement.We first derive an additive decomposition of bilateral GDP comovement into components capturing shock transmission and shock correlation.We quantify this decomposition in a parsimonious multi-country, multi-sector dynamic network propagation model, using data for the G7 countries over the period 1978-2007.Our main finding is that while the network transmission of shocks is quantitatively important, it accounts for a minority of observed comovement under the estimated range of structural elasticities.Contemporaneous responses to correlated shocks in the production network are more successful at generating comovement than intertemporal propagation through capital accumulation.Extensions with multiple shocks, nominal rigidities, and international financial integration leave our main result unchanged.A combination of TFP and labor supply shocks is quantitatively successful at reproducing the observed international business cycle.",Andrei A.

We examine resource redeployment as a strategy to overcome scarcity in factor markets by modeling when expanding firms will internally redeploy versus hire workers via external markets. Our model predicts that redeployment is most valuable when there are large differences in resource scarcity across factor markets and when output is highly sensitive to worker skill and complementarities between labor and other resources. The ability to overcome resource scarcity allows firms with redeployment capabilities to enter markets that other firms would not. Data on sugar mills in Brazil, where a sudden demand boom incentivized expansion, corroborate the predictions. Our research identifies new entry advantages from resource redeployment.

"Absenteeism, Productivity, and Relational Contracts Inside the Firm","We study relational contracts among managers using unique data that tracks transfers of workers across teams in Indian ready-made garment factories.We focus on how relational contracts help managers cope with worker absenteeism shocks, which are frequent, often large, weakly correlated across teams, and which substantially reduce team productivity.Together these facts imply gains from sharing workers.We show that managers respond to shocks by lending and borrowing workers in a manner consistent with relational contracting, but many potentially beneficial transfers are unrealized.This is because managers' primary relationships are with a very small subset of potential partners.A borrowing event study around main trading partners' separations from the firm reinforces the importance of relationships.We show robustness to excluding worker moves least likely to reflect relational borrowing responses to idiosyncratic absenteeism shocks.Counterfactual simulations reveal large gains to reducing costs associated with forming and maintaining additional relationships among managers.",Achyuta Adhvaryu; Anant Nyshadham; Jean-François Gauthier; Jorge Tamayo,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w29581,"Absenteeism, Productivity, Business, Industrial organization, Labour economics, Economics, Management, Economic growth",Trinity College Dublin; National Bureau of Economic Research; International Paper (United States); Boston College; Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies; University of Michigan–Ann Arbor,"NBER Working Paper No. 29581; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Harvard Business School Soldiers Field, Morgan Hall 292 Boston, MA 02163; School of Business University of Michigan 701 Tappan Street Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1234; Trinity College Dublin, NBER, Boston College, U. of Houston, Graduate Institute Geneva, Zurich,; Boston College 140 Commonwealth Avenue Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 United States; Montana, UVA, Michigan, Hawaii, Indian Statistical Institute, Harvard, Cambridge, Oxford,; School of Business University of Michigan 701 Tappan Street Ann Arbor, MI 48109 and","NBER Working Paper No. 29581; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Harvard Business School Soldiers Field, Morgan Hall 292 Boston, MA 02163; School of Business University of Michigan 701 Tappan Street Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1234; Trinity College Dublin, NBER, Boston College, U. of Houston, Graduate Institute Geneva, Zurich,; Boston College 140 Commonwealth Avenue Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 United States; Montana, UVA, Michigan, Hawaii, Indian Statistical Institute, Harvard, Cambridge, Oxford,; School of Business University of Michigan 701 Tappan Street Ann Arbor, MI 48109 and"
Optimal Ownership and Firm Performance: An Analysis of China's FDI Liberalization,"Abstract Seminal theories of the firm posit that firm ownership is allocated to minimize contractual inefficiencies. Yet, it remains unclear how much the optimal ownership choice affects firm performance in practice. This paper provides a first quantification of the gains from optimal ownership within multinational firms, by exploiting a major liberalization of China's policy restrictions on foreign ownership. The liberalization allowed previously restricted firms to become fully foreign owned. We find that these reoptimized ownership choices raise firm output by 40% and productivity by 7.5% on average. An extended property-rights theory of the multinational firm rationalizes these effects and their heterogeneity.",Hong Ma; Peter Eppinger,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01431,"China, Foreign direct investment, Liberalization, International economics, Economics, Business, Foreign ownership, International trade, Monetary economics, Market economy, Macroeconomics, Political science, Law",University of Tübingen; Tsinghua University,University of Tübingen and CESifo peter.eppinger@uni-tuebingen.de; Tsinghua University mahong@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,University of Tübingen and CESifo peter.eppinger@uni-tuebingen.de; Tsinghua University mahong@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn
The Asymmetric Effects of Financial Frictions,"Economic variables move asymmetrically over the business cycle: quickly during crises but slowly during recoveries. I show that this asymmetry is stronger in countries with less developed financial systems and greater financial frictions. Then I explain this fact using a learning model with endogenous information about economic conditions. Financial frictions, which I capture by higher bankruptcy costs, magnify the reaction of lending rates and economic activity to negative shocks and then delay their recovery by restricting information after the crisis. Empirical evidence and a quantitative exploration of the model show that this explanation is consistent with the data.",Guillermo Ordoñez; Guillermo Ordóñez,,,,,,,,,,,,2013.0,https://doi.org/10.1086/673886,"Business cycle, Bankruptcy, Economics, Information asymmetry, Empirical evidence, Monetary economics, Financial crisis, Finance, Macroeconomics, Philosophy, Epistemology",National Bureau of Economic Research,University of Pennsylvania and National Bureau of Economic Research,University of Pennsylvania and National Bureau of Economic Research
The Whole is Greater than the Sum of Its Parts: Complementary Reforms to Address Microeconomic Distortions,"This paper links microeconomic rigidities and technological adoption to propose a partial explanation for the observed differences in income per capita across countries. The paper first presents a neoclassical general equilibrium model with heterogeneous production units. It assumes that developing countries do not generate frontier technologies but can adopt them by investing in new capital, which requires firm renewal. The model analyzes how this process can be hindered by barriers to the entry of new investment projects and the exit of obsolete ones. It finds that there are nonlinearities in the way entry and exit barriers operate: Barriers have increasing costs, and they reinforce each other's negative impact. The paper then calibrates and simulates the model to measure the impact of these barriers on the GDP per capita gap between the United States and a large sample of developing countries. It accounts for a range of 26 to 60% of the income gap between the United States and 107 developing countries. Most importantly, the model implies that, for the median developing economy, about 50% of the simulated gap is explained by the interaction of entry and exit barriers (and the rest by their individual effects). The paper's main policy implication is that only comprehensive reforms can have substantial effects, especially when initial distortions are large. If they are too narrow (focusing on only one barrier) or too mild (leaving in place a large distortion), microeconomic reforms are unlikely to have significant effects on aggregate productivity and output growth.",Facundo Piguillem; Norman Loayza; Norman V.

The China Shock and Employment in Portuguese Firms,"This paper considers the effects of Chinese import competition on firm-level labor market outcomes in Portugal.We examine direct competition in the Portuguese market and indirect competition Portugal's largest export markets in Western Europe.Using rich employer-employee data matched to firm-level trade transactions, we measure the degree to which different Portuguese firms faced Chinese import competition, based on firm product mix and distribution of sales across countries.We find economically and statistically significant employment declines in firms with more exposure to Chinese competition in European export markets, but minimal effects of direct competition in Portugal.Our findings also suggest a centrally important role for Portugal's stringent labor market regulations in limiting firms' ability to adjust to competitive shocks.In our earlier sample period (1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000), firms have limited ability to adjust employment, hours, or wages, and the primary adjustment margin is firm exit.In the later period (2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007), when more flexible temporary contracts comprise a larger share of employment, we find employment reductions among more exposed firms.Those employment reductions are entirely accounted for by changes in temporary employment, with no effect on permanent employment.We expect these findings to be informative for other peripheral European countries that had specialized in labor-intensive manufacturing industries operating under inflexible labor market regimes.",Ana Venancio; Ana Venâncio; Brian K.

The Long-Run Labor Market Effects of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement,"This paper assesses the long-run effects of the 1988 Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA) on the Canadian labor market using matched longitudinal administrative data for the years 1984-2004.We simultaneously examine the labor market effects of increased export expansion and import competition, generally finding adverse effects of Canadian tariff cuts and favorable effects of U.S. cuts, though both effects are small.Workers initially employed in industries that experienced larger Canadian tariff concessions exhibit a heightened probability of layoffs at large firms, but little impact on long-run cumulative earnings.Lower earnings and years worked at the initial employer are offset by gains in other manufacturing industries, construction, and services.Canadian workers quickly transitioned out of industries facing import competition, with the majority of industry adjustment occurring among new entrants to the labor market.",Brian K.

Coping with H-1B Shortages: Firm Performance and Mitigation Strategies,"The H-1B visa program allows companies to hire skilled foreign workers. Before 2014, the vast majority of these visas were allocated on a first-come-first-served basis. Since then, the program has been severely oversubscribed and all cap-subject visas have been allocated through lotteries. The authors merged Compustat data with administrative firm-level data on the universe of approved petitions for H-1B visas. Using difference-in-differences and matching estimators, this article finds that the switch in the visa allocation system negatively affected the growth of companies that used the H-1B program.

Cheap Thrills: The Price of Leisure and the Global Decline in Work Hours,"Recreation prices and hours worked have both fallen over the last century. We construct a macroeconomic model with general preferences that allows for trending recreation prices, wages, and work hours along a balanced-growth path. Estimating the model using aggregate data from OECD countries, we find that the fall in recreation prices can explain a large fraction of the decline in hours. We also use our model to show that the diverging prices of the recreation bundles consumed by different demographic groups can account for much of the increase in leisure inequality observed in the United States over the last decades.",Alexandr Kopytov; Mathieu Taschereau-Dumouchel; Nikolai Roussanov,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.1086/723717,"Recreation, Work (physics), Economics, Inequality, Construct (python library), Fraction (chemistry), Econometrics, Leisure time, Labour economics, Demographic economics, Physical activity, Mathematics, Computer science, Engineering, Political science, Medicine, Mathematical analysis, Chemistry, Organic chemistry, Law, Physical medicine and rehabilitation, Programming language, Mechanical engineering",University of Hong Kong; Cornell University; National Bureau of Economic Research,Cornell University; University of Hong Kong; University of Pennsylvania and National Bureau of Economic Research,Cornell University; University of Hong Kong; University of Pennsylvania and National Bureau of Economic Research
Lessons from U.S.-China Trade Relations,"We review theoretical and empirical work on the economic effects of the United States and China trade relations during the last decades.We first discuss the origins of the China shock, its measurement, and present methods used to study its economic effects on different outcomes.We then focus on the recent U.S.-China trade war.We discuss methods used to evaluate its effects, describe its economic effects, and analyze if this increase in trade protectionism reverted the effects of the China shock.The main lessons learned in this review are: (i) the aggregate gains from U.S.-China trade created winners and losers; (ii) China's trade expansion seems not to be the main cause of the decline in U.S. manufacturing employment during the same period; and (iii) the recent trade war generated welfare losses, had small employment effects, and was ineffective in reversing the distributional effects due to the China shock.",Fernando Parro; Lorenzo Caliendo,,,,,,,,,,,,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w30335,"China, International trade, Geology, Political science, Economics, History, Archaeology",Yale University; Pennsylvania State University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Yale University School of Management 135 Prospect Street New Haven, CT 06520 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Pennsylvania State University Department of Economics University Park, PA 16801 and NBER","Yale University School of Management 135 Prospect Street New Haven, CT 06520 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Pennsylvania State University Department of Economics University Park, PA 16801 and NBER"
Implications of Population Aging for Economic Growth,"The share of the population aged 60 and over is projected to increase in nearly every country in the world during 2005-2050.Population ageing will tend to lower both labor-force participation and savings rates, thereby raising concerns about a future slowing of economic growth.Our calculations suggest that OECD countries are likely to see modest -but not catastrophic -declines in the rate of economic growth.However, behavioral responses (including greater female labor force participation) and policy reforms (including an increase in the legal age of retirement) can mitigate the economic consequences of an older population.In most non-OECD countries, declining fertility rates will cause labor-force-to-population ratios to rise as the shrinking share of young people will more than offset the skewing of adults toward the older ages.These factors suggest that population ageing will not significantly impede the pace of economic growth in developing countries.",David Bloom; David Canning; David E.

Governance of Eswatini Apparel Regional Value Chains and the Implications of Covid-19,"There is a growing literature on the impact of Covid-19 on commercial and labour conditions at suppliers in apparel global value chains (GVCs). Yet much less is known about the implications for suppliers operating in regional value chains (RVCs) in the global South. In this article, we focus on Eswatini, which has grown to become the largest African manufacturer and exporter of apparel to the region. We draw on a combination of firm-level export data and interviews with stakeholders before and after the Covid-19 lockdown to shed light on the influence of private and public governance on suppliers' economic and social upgrading and downgrading. We point to the coexistence of two separate private governance structures: the first characterised by direct contracts between South African retailers and large manufacturers (direct suppliers); the second operating through indirect purchasing via intermediaries from relatively smaller producers (indirect suppliers). While direct suppliers enjoyed higher levels of economic and social upgrading than indirect suppliers before Covid-19, the pandemic reinforced this division, with severe price cuts for indirect suppliers. Furthermore, while retailers provided some direct suppliers with support throughout the crisis, this was not the case for indirect suppliers, who remain comparatively more vulnerable. In terms of public governance, the negative consequences of the lockdown on firms' income and workers' livelihoods have been compounded by the state's ineffective response. Our paper contributes to the research on RVCs in the global South, enhancing our understanding of how different governance structures and external shocks affect firms' and workers' upgrading and downgrading prospects.La publications à propos l’impact de la COVID-19 sur les conditions commerciales et du travail chez les fournisseurs des chaines de valeur globales (en anglais : Global Value Chains, GVCs), dans le secteur de l’habillement, est en croissance. Cependant, on connait beaucoup moins à propos les implications de la COVID-19 sur les fournisseurs qui opèrent au niveau des chaines de valeur régionales (en anglais : Regional Value Chains, RVCs) dans les pays du Sud. Dans cet article, nous nous concentrons sur Eswatini, qui est devenu le plus grand producteur Africain et exportateur d’habillement dans la région. Combinant des données collectés au niveau de l’entreprise sur ses exportations, et des entretiens avec plusieurs partis prenants avant et après le confinement COVID-19, nous illustrons l’influence de la gouvernance publique et privée sur la revalorisation et dévalorisation sociale et économique des fournisseurs. Nous attirons l’attention à la coexistence de deux structures séparés de gouvernance privée : la première structure est caractérisée par des contrats directs entre les détaillants de l’Afrique du Sud, et les gros producteurs (fournisseurs directs) ; la deuxième structure est assurée par les achats indirects chez les producteurs relativement plus petits (fournisseurs indirects) par des intermédiaires. Alors que les fournisseurs directs bénéficiaient de des niveaux de revalorisation économique et sociale plus élevés même avant la COVID-19, la pandémie a renforcé leur séparation par rapport aux fournisseurs indirects ; ces-ci ont plutôt subi une forte réduction des prix payés pour leur production. D’ailleurs, les détaillants ont soutenu les fournisseurs directs pendant la crise, mais ceci n’a pas été le cas pour les fournisseurs indirects, qui demeurent plus vulnérables. En ce qui concerne la gouvernance publique, les conséquences négatives du confinement sur le revenu des entreprises et sur la subsistance des travailleurs ont été aggravés par les interventions inefficaces de l’état. Cet étude contribue à la recherche sur les RVCs dans les pays du Sud, améliorant notre compréhension de comment les différentes structures de gouvernance et les chocs externes touchent les perspectives de valorisation et dévalorisation des entreprises et des travailleurs.",Giovanni Pasquali; Shane Godfrey,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41287-021-00383-3,"Corporate governance, Business, Global value chain, Intermediary, Clothing, Supply chain, Value (mathematics), Industrial organization, Economics, Market economy, International trade, Comparative advantage, Marketing, Finance, Archaeology, Machine learning, Computer science, History",University of Manchester; University of Cape Town,"The Global Development Institute, University of Manchester, Arthur Lewis Building, Room 2.037, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9PL, UK; Institute of Development and Labour Law, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa","The Global Development Institute, University of Manchester, Arthur Lewis Building, Room 2.037, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9PL, UK; Institute of Development and Labour Law, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa"

The Management and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS): An Overview,"Understanding productivity and business dynamics requires measuring production outputs and inputs. Through its surveys and use of administrative data, the Census Bureau collects information on production outputs and inputs including labor, capital, energy, and materials. With the introduction of the Management and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS), the Census Bureau added information on another component of production: management. It has long been hypothesized that management is an important component of firm success, but until recently the study of management was confined to hypotheses, anecdotes, and case studies. Building upon the work of Bloom and Van Reenen (2007), the first-ever large scale survey of management practices in the United States, the MOPS, was conducted by the Census Bureau for 2010. A second, enhanced version of the MOPS is being conducted for 2015. The enhancement includes two new topics related to management: data and decision making (DDD) and uncertainty. As information technology has expanded plants are increasingly able to utilize data in their decision making. Structured management practices have been found to be complementary to DDD in earlier studies. Uncertainty has policy implications because uncertainty is found to be associated with reduced investment and employment. Uncertainty also plays a role in the targeting component of management.",Catherine Buffington; Lucia Foster; Ron S.

Do it Capabilities Still Drive Productivity and Innovation in the Digital Age?,"In light of the increased prevalence of new information technologies, such as cloud computing and machine learning, traditional IT measures based on physical IT capital have become unreliable, while IT complementary human capital has become the new bottleneck. New IT technologies have thus, somewhat paradoxically, made the measurement of IT capabilities and their impact on firm productivity significantly harder than they already were. We create novel IT measurements based on industry-, and firm-level demands for IT skills and occupations from 2010 until 2022. Strong correlations with ""official"" productivity measures at the industry level validate our approach and suggest their usefulness at the firm level, where no official and reliable measures currently exist. We demonstrate that our measures are robustly associated with higher productivity at both the industry and firm levels, based on a battery of estimation techniques from the productivity literature. Our preferred firm-level estimation implies that a one percent increase in IT skills is associated with a 0.009 percent increase in total sales, which translates to an average gain of $540,000. Our measures are also positively associated with firm innovation, as measured by the total number of patents, citations, and real value of patents, suggesting that IT human capital drives productivity growth through innovation. Our methodology to define these human capital IT measures is general and simple enough to allow for future and backward-compatible extensions.",Erik Brynjolfsson; Jin Wang; Sebastian Steffen; Wang Jin,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4765508,"Productivity, Manufacturing engineering, Business, Industrial organization, Engineering, Economics, Economic growth",Stanford Medicine; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Boston College; National Bureau of Economic Research,Boston College - Carroll School of Management; MIT Sloan School of Management; Stanford Digital Economy Lab (S-DEL); Stanford Digital Economy Lab; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - Initiative on the Digital Economy; Stanford; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER),Boston College - Carroll School of Management; MIT Sloan School of Management; Stanford Digital Economy Lab (S-DEL); Stanford Digital Economy Lab; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - Initiative on the Digital Economy; Stanford; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)
Helping Small Businesses Become More Data-Driven: A Field Experiment on eBay,"As digitization sweeps across industries and markets, analytics and data-driven decision making (DDD) are becoming increasingly important. The adoption of analytics and DDD has been slower in small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) compared with large firms, and reliable causal estimates of the impacts of analytics tools for small businesses have been lacking. We derive experiment-based estimates of the impact of an analytics tool on SME outcomes, analyzing the randomized introduction of eBay’s Seller Hub (SH), a data-rich seller dashboard. We find that SH adoption is associated with increased DDD and that access to SH increases e-retailers’ revenues by 3.6% on average, as more items are transacted and service quality increases, without increases in average prices. Our results suggest that analytics and DDD help SMEs establish a competitive advantage. Managerial practices play an important role in reaping the benefits from the analytics dashboard, as more than a third of the SH impact is driven by active performance monitoring. Digital platforms should therefore embed analytics tools to support SMEs to increase entry and revenues. Furthermore, policies to support small businesses’ transition to the data era should address analytics and DDD gaps by ensuring access to both tools like SH and to appropriate managerial training.

Patterns of Multidimensional Poverty in the United States,"The accurate accounting of where and for whom deprivations occur is fundamental to addressing poverty. In the United States, the official poverty measure considers only a person's income, although poverty is increasingly understood internationally as a set of multiple, interlinked deprivations. This article introduces a decomposable multidimensional poverty (MDP) measure that addresses these shortcomings by using thirteen American Community Survey microdata indicators to identify education, health, housing, and economic security deprivations for individuals. In 2017, the national poverty rate was 13.7 percent when measured using MDP and 13.1 percent using official poverty. Although similar at the national scale, Hispanic, Asian, and older persons had higher poverty rates using the multidimensional measure, whereas Black and young persons had higher rates when using official poverty. MDP tended to be higher than official poverty in dense urban areas, whereas official poverty tended to be higher in rural areas. Further, MDP was a stronger correlate with COVID-19 death rates than official poverty through the first three waves of the pandemic. The design of MDP recognizes that individuals can experience poverty in different ways and provides a more holistic view of people and places.",David C.

Computationally efficient Bayesian unit-level random neural network modelling of survey data under informative sampling for small area estimation,"Abstract The topic of neural networks has seen a surge of interest in recent years. However, one of the main challenges with these approaches is quantification of uncertainty. The use of random weight models offer a potential solution. In addition to uncertainty quantification, these models are extremely computationally efficient as they do not require optimisation through stochastic gradient descent. We show how this approach can be used to account for informative sampling of survey data through the use of a pseudo-likelihood. We illustrate the effectiveness of this methodology through simulation and data application involving American National Election Studies data.",Paul A Parker; Paul A. Parker; Scott H Holan; Scott H.

Small area estimates for Voting Rights Act Section 203(b) coverage determinations,"The Director of the US Census Bureau every five years, under the Voting Rights Act (VRA) Section 203(b), determines which states and political subdivisions must provide ballot assistance in languages other than English. These rule-based determinations use small-area estimates of the proportions of voting-age citizen members of racial/ethnic Language Minority Groups (LMGs) who are limited Englishproficient (LEP) and of LEP LMG persons who are also illiterate. This large-scale Small Area Estimation (SAE) effort by the US Census Bureau is based on American Community Survey five-year data. This paper focuses on the unique attributes of this SAE problem, including the predominance in each LMG of tiny domains along with relatively few large domains that account for the bulk of LMG citizens. The data and small area models are treated separately for distinct LMGs, and the spirit of the law requires that the domain estimates should be produced in a similar way across LMGs for each type of geography (Jurisdictions, which are mostly counties, plus two types of American Indian and Alaskan Native areas).

Conjugate Bayesian unit‐level modelling of count data under informative sampling designs,"Unit‐level models for survey data offer many advantages over their area‐level counterparts, such as potential for more precise estimates and a natural benchmarking property. However, two main challenges occur in this context: accounting for an informative survey design and handling non‐Gaussian data types. The pseudo‐likelihood approach is one solution to the former, and conjugate multivariate distribution theory offers a solution to the latter. By combining these approaches, we attain a unit‐level model for count data that accounts for informative sampling designs and includes a fully Bayesian model uncertainty propagation. Importantly, conjugate full conditional distributions hold under the pseudo‐likelihood, yielding an extremely computationally efficient approach. Our method is illustrated via an empirical simulation study using count data from the American Community Survey public use microdata sample.",Paul A. Parker; Ryan Janicki; Scott H.

A Bayesian Functional Data Model for Surveys Collected under Informative Sampling with Application to Mortality Estimation Using NHANES,"Abstract Functional data are often extremely high-dimensional and exhibit strong dependence structures but can often prove valuable for both prediction and inference. The literature on functional data analysis is well developed; however, there has been very little work involving functional data in complex survey settings. Motivated by physical activity monitor data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we develop a Bayesian model for functional covariates that can properly account for the survey design. Our approach is intended for non-Gaussian data and can be applied in multivariate settings. In addition, we make use of a variety of Bayesian modeling techniques to ensure that the model is fit in a computationally efficient manner. We illustrate the value of our approach through two simulation studies as well as an example of mortality estimation using NHANES data.",Paul A. Parker; Scott H.

Bayesian Multisource Hierarchical Models with Applications to the Monthly Retail Trade Survey,"Abstract The integration of multiple survey, administrative, and third-party data offers the opportunity to innovate and improve survey estimation via statistical modeling. With decreasing response rates and increasing interest for more timely and geographically detailed estimates, imputation methodology that combines multiple data sources to adjust for low unit response and allow for more detailed publication levels, including geographic estimates, is both timely and necessary. Motivated by the Advance Monthly Retail Trade Survey (MARTS) and Monthly Retail Trade Survey (MRTS), we propose Bayesian hierarchical multiple imputation-dependent data models with the goals of automating imputation for the MARTS by using historic MRTS data and providing geographically granular (state-level) estimates for the MRTS via mass imputation using third-party data and spatial dependence. As a natural byproduct of this approach, measures of uncertainty are provided. This article illustrates the advantages of applying established Bayesian hierarchical modeling techniques with multiple source data to address practical problems in official statistics and is, therefore, of independent interest. The motivating empirical studies are unified by their hierarchical modeling framework, which ultimately results in a more principled approach for estimation for the MARTS and a more geographically granular data product for the MRTS.",Darcy Steeg Morris; Scott H Holan; Scott H.

Are There “Hot Spots” of Primary Impairments among New SSDI Awardees – and Do We Know Why?,"This paper examines local-level variation in the primary disabling conditions of new awardees for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) from 2005 through 2018. It uses data from the Social Security Administration’s Disability Analysis File data linked to other publicly available information from the American Community Survey and Area Health Resource File. The analysis is at the level of U.S. Census Bureau Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs). The paper documents the share of awards in each PUMA and year in one of five impairment group categories, selected to align with areas of strong policy interest. In each impairment group, the paper identifies “hot spots” as PUMAs in which the share of awards for that condition is in the top 10 percent relative to other PUMAs in the same year. The paper documents the geographic variation in award shares and hot spots using maps and uses regression analysis to explore relationships between SSDI award shares by impairment group and a range of PUMA-level factors.

Disability and the household context: Findings for the United States from the public Use Microdata Sample of the American Community Survey,"Introduction Based on questions about impairments and activity limitations, the American Community Survey shows that roughly 13% of the U.S. population is experiencing disability. As most people live in households with other persons, this study explores disability at the household level. Considering the literature on household decision-making, solidarity, and capabilities in disability, this analysis of the household context of disability takes into account residential settings, household composition, and urban–rural differences. Method The 2015–2019 ACS Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), which shows persons with disability (PwD) and persons without disability (PwoD), also indicates household membership, used here to separately identify PwoD as those living in households with persons with disability (PwoD_HHwD) and those in households without any household member with disability (PwoD_HHwoD). Relationship variables reveal the composition of households with and without disabilities. An adaption of Beale's rural–urban continuum code for counties is used to approximate rural–urban differences with ACS PUMS data. Results Solo living is two times as common among persons with disability than among persons without disability, and higher in rural than urban areas. In addition to 43 million PwD, there are another 42 million PwoD_HHwD. Two times as many persons are impacted by disability, either of their own or that of a household member, than shown by an analysis of individual-level disability. For family households, differences in the composition of households with and without disabilities are considerable with much greater complexities in the makeup of families with disability. The presence of multiple generations stands out. Adult sons or daughters without disability play an important role. Modest urban–rural differences exist in the composition of family households with disability, with a greater presence of multigenerational households in large cities. Discussion This research reveals the much wider scope of household-level disability than indicated by disability of individuals alone. The greater complexity and multigenerational makeup of households with disability imply intergenerational solidarity, reciprocity, and resource sharing. Household members without disability may add to the capabilities of persons with disabilities. For the sizeable share of PwD living solo, there is concern about their needs being met.",Christiane von Reichert,,,,,,,,,,,,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.3389/fresc.2022.875966,"Microdata (statistics), American Community Survey, Public use, Context (archaeology), Census, Geography, Survey sampling, Sample (material), Population, Gerontology, Demographic economics, Environmental health, Medicine, Political science, Economics, Chemistry, Archaeology, Chromatography, Law",University of Montana,"RTC: Rural at the Rural Institute for Inclusive Communities, University of Montana, Missoula, MT, United States; Department of Geography, Franke College of Forestry and Conservation, University of Montana, Missoula, MT, United States","RTC: Rural at the Rural Institute for Inclusive Communities, University of Montana, Missoula, MT, United States; Department of Geography, Franke College of Forestry and Conservation, University of Montana, Missoula, MT, United States"
Small Firm Financing Frictions: How Salient are they and what are their Real Effects? Review and Perspectives for New Research,"We review the literature on the sources of financing and associated financing frictions facing small firms. Using data from the Survey of Business Owners, we first show that about half of small firms do not report using any external finance either for startup or for expansion. Among those that do, bank and credit card-based borrowing by the business and its owners account for the overwhelming share of external finance. Second, we highlight that there is growing evidence of heterogeneity in financing frictions facing small firms: a substantial share of firms may not even seek external finance or benefit from relaxed constraints because they do not wish to grow; on the other hand, relaxing constraints has large measured effects on investment and employment for certain sub-populations of small firms. This heterogeneity has important implications for how average effects are interpreted in academic studies, as well as for how policy is enacted. We conclude by noting the greater availability of micro data on small firm financing in recent years. This has the potential to generate substantial insight on the degree to which the rise of financial technology can overcome traditional financing frictions, as well as enhance our understanding of the effectiveness of different types of government interventions on small business financing and growth.",Gordon M.

Why does country music sound white? Race and the voice of nostalgia,"Abstract Since American country music has historical ties to musics of many different regions and racial groups, the answer to the question ‘Why does country music sound white?’ is by no means obvious. This article asks how country became white, and how it stays white. To inquire into why country music sounds white is to wonder what whiteness sounds like, and how it is heard. This article considers the meaning of the sounds of country in the making of a pose of historically ‘innocent’ and ‘besieged’ American whiteness. Focusing on the cultural politics of nostalgia, I argue that in the construction of an idealized past-ness, or ‘used to’, country music not only ‘talks white’, but it is whites who hear it, and whose whiteness is produced and reproduced by what they hear. Keywords: Racecountry musicconservatismnostalgiawhitenessUnited States Acknowledgements This article is far better for the advice of the journal editors and the comments of reviewers. I would also especially like to thank Charles Gallagher and France Winddance Twine for their many efforts, and Joel Wainwright and Aaron Fox for challenging and insightful comments. Notes 1. In his proclamation, Bush echoed Nixon's 1974 speech at the opening of Opryland (the theme park/country music museum associated with the Grand Ole Opry), when the President said that country music ‘talks about family. It talks about religion. And it … makes America a better country’ (quoted in Goddu 1998, p. 48). 2. The connection between country music and the Republican Party has held so persistently that a group of country music industry insiders has recently formed the ‘Music Row Democrats’ in an attempt to combat the power of conservative Republicanism within the industry and among its fan base. See New York Times, 19 August 2006, and http://www.musicrowdemocrats.com. 3. Outside of North America, country music's popularity is less associated with those who self-identify as ‘white’. Country is very popular, for example, in parts of the Caribbean and in Brazil (Fox 2004b; Dent 2005). Aaron Fox and Christine Yano are presently completing an edited volume, Songs Out of Place (forthcoming), which examines these other ‘countries’. 4. Writing about country music, I am unfortunately forced to assume that most readers are, while perhaps not fans themselves, at least familiar with the genre and some of its better-known performers. If not, the recordings of most of the artists I name in the text are relatively easy to find. The internet is particularly helpful in this regard. 5. See John Munro's (2004) review for an excellent overview of the burgeoning historical work on whiteness in North America. 6. ‘With noise is born disorder and its opposite: the world. With music is born power and its opposite: subversion. … All music, any organization of sounds is then a tool for the creation or consolidation of a community, of a totality. It is what links a power center to its subjects, and thus, more generally, it is an attribute of power in all its forms’ (Attali 1985, p. 6). 7. Emphasis in original. 8. In 1961, there were eighty-one radio stations in the US dedicated to country music; 606 stations by 1969, 1,534 in 1980, 2,108 in 1989 and 2,427 in 1994 (Cusic 1998, p. 204). 9. To think about these instruments’ status as ‘traditional’ is part of the problem at hand. 10. ‘Square’ songs are those which follow a ‘steady pattern of uninterrupted four-bar hypermeasures’ (Neal 1998, p. 325); in other words, those that have a regular phrasing based on musical ‘lines’ that are four bars long. This structure (with slight variations) is commonly played in a thirty-two bar format with an AABA rhyming scheme, and can sometimes serve as an important formal limitation on what counts as ‘country’ (Fox 2004a, pp. 218, 242). 11. There are some (e.g. Malone 2002, p. 15) who seem to understand twang as a term of ‘denigration’ for the ‘southern sound’, but it has no such meaning here. Rather, it is the way that the ‘southernness’ of twang became implicit that is of interest. 12. These instruments usually have less ‘sustain’ than rock instruments – a note on a banjo, unlike an electric guitar, will not resonate for long after it is plucked – and thus the ‘wail’ of rock instrumentation is very rare in any variety of country. Although electric guitars and other instruments common in rock music are of course now standard in country music, these are often played alongside ‘traditional’ instruments, or amplified in a manner that purposefully distinguishes the sound from rock music. This is the case, for example, with the distinctive ‘twang’ of the Fender Telecaster, the electric guitar of choice in country music since the 1950s. Indeed, the Telecaster's preferred sound (a result of the guitar in combination with a specific mode of amplification) is now so ‘obviously’ country that one need only pluck a single note to give a phrase a country ‘feel’. In contemporary commercial music, Dwight Yoakam (and his Telecaster) epitomize this vocal and instrumental ‘twang’. 13. Strictly speaking, one cannot equate diphthongization with what I am here calling twang, with its distinctive cultural associations with the US South. Diphthongs – what linguistic anthropologists also call ‘vowel glides’ (Feld et al. 2004, p. 337) – are also features of non-southern anglo-North American regional dialects. In Canada's Maritime provinces, where I was raised, vowel glides of the form that Feld et al. (2004, p. 337) suggest singers use to ‘index their “country”-ness’ (cf. Samuels 2004) are very common. There are, however, important differences in pronunciation (e.g. ‘bed’ is pronounced ‘bee-yed’ in Nova Scotia, ‘bay-yed’ in the stereotypical southern drawl); it is hard to imagine the Maritime accent, in either speech or song, ever being labeled ‘twang’. It is not merely diphthongization that is at issue here, but a way of symbolically mobilizing a suite of vocal and musical features whose nexus I am calling call twang. I want to thank Aaron Fox for helping me with these ideas and the relevant literature. 14. That race is crucial to what the accent communicates is clear from the remarks like Malone's, quoted above, regarding Charley Pride's singing. 15. On the difference between wars of ‘manoeuvre’ and ‘position’ (or ‘siege’), and the ultimately greater political importance of the latter, see Gramsci (1971, pp. 229–43). 16. I say ‘most’ because of the important work of David Samuels (2004) on the refusal of Apache country singers to sing in the stereotypical accent. Samuels argues convincingly that this move is a considered politicization of a racist historical legacy. 17. Emphasis in original. 18. It is of course arguable that country music has made a caricature of both patination and authenticity, since standardization and commodification would seem to rob them of the very qualities that determine their meanings. 19. A full discussion of the form and content of country music lyrics is impossible here, but see Fox (2004a, pp. 214–48) and Brackett (1995, pp. 77–99) for very helpful analyses. 20. Very briefly, the origin story as it is conventionally told (e.g. Malone 1985; Sample 1996, pp. 176–86) begins with poor rural southern whites in the 1920s, who were reached by the first radio broadcasts and recordings by performers like the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers (Ellison 1995). The 1930s, despite economic hardships, was also the decade during which most US households obtained a radio, and promoters of commercial country music, especially in the South and West, took advantage of the medium's wide dissemination. World War II marked the beginning of country's urbanization, and its mass popularization. This is the era of Nashville's Grand Ole Opry's great popularity, and artists like Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell, whose careers began in the immediate post-war era, became household names in the South and well known throughout the US. In the 1950s and 1960s, country/rock derivatives like rockabilly – think Elvis – gained a national and international audience, and country music's smoother ‘Nashville sound’ (à la Patsy Cline) also reached far beyond the region. The 1960s and 1970s witnessed the commercial dominance of so-called ‘hard’ country artists like Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, and Loretta Lynn. Today, the style of these singer-songwriters is widely associated with the sound of ‘real’ country music, true to the southern, working-class roots of the genre (Sanjek 1998, p. 23–4; Malone 2002, p. 254; Fox 2004a, pp. 103, 150), in contrast to the pop ‘new country’ that has filled commercial country radio since the late 1980s (Haslam 1999, p. 293). 21. Adorno's (2002, p. 375) oft-cited remark that Wagner's music ‘itself speaks the language of Fascism’ is a case in point. 22. In addition, there is a tradition of psychoanalytic writing on music and sound (e.g. Coriat 1945; Noy 1966–7; Rosolato 1974). This is a more disciplinarily specialized effort, the concerns of which overlap somewhat with mine, but with which I do not seriously engage. Founded upon the examination of purportedly universal human psychic propensities, this literature is entirely uninterested in race and cultural politics. 23. Radano's Lying Up a Nation (2003) is an extended and brilliant critique of such claims to ‘originalism’, and one might read Gilroy's Against Race (2000) as a complementary ‘metacritique’ of the very vocabulary through which such claims are made. 24. For an excellent framing of some aspects of cultural studies of music, see Shepherd and Wicke (1997). 25. Althusser's famous account of ‘interpellation’ is presented in ‘Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses (Notes Towards an Investigation)’: ‘all ideology hails or interpellates concrete individuals as concrete subjects’ (Althusser 1971, p. 173, emphasis in original). The passages that describe the ‘hail’ that interpellates the subject can be found on pp. 170–6. 26. Radano's engaging excavation of black music's ‘sonically absent history’ (2003, p. 5) brings the power of this insight to the historical record, revealing its constitutive partiality (in both senses, for the record is both filled with random gaps, and at the same time plays favourites with what it is inclined to hear). 27. The fact that these politics are in no way easily classified as ‘right-wing’ points, in Gramsci's thought, to the political opportunity a cultural phenomenon like country presents for the left, an opportunity it must pursue energetically. 28. The ways in which class operates in and through country music merits an extensive discussion on its own. This is all the more true with the massive expansion of country's ‘core’ audience over the years. My own feeling is that country music's growing appeal outside of its class affinities is due at least in part to the increasing inequality that characterizes the American political economy. According to this (admittedly speculative) explanation, country's nostalgic authenticity, its gritty ‘realness’ – for reasons similar to those I outline in this paper – is all the more appealing both to those whites who have lost or have never obtained status and welfare through this dynamic, and to those who seek to claim some working-classed ‘groundedness’ in their increasingly distant privilege. I think much of the appeal of ‘alt.country’ to educated urban whites like me is a part of this movement. Aside from Fox's work, Peterson (1992) and Hartigan (1999) can certainly help think about these processes. 29. For example, there is an old and well-known joke that asks, ‘How many country singers does it take to change a light-bulb?’ The answer: ‘Two. One to screw in the new light-bulb, and another to sing sadly of the old one.’ 30. ‘[A] storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. This storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress’ (Benjamin 1968, pp. 257–8). 31. It may be worth noting that for Adorno, ‘ideology’ did not have the Althusserian inescapability that it usually connotes in contemporary cultural studies. For him, it was basically false consciousness, a veil that could be lifted – at least in theory. 32. Gramsci (1971, pp. 106–13) discusses ‘passive revolution’, a concept he says is very closely related to ‘war of position’, but differentiated in its historical specificity. 33. Country music is not, and has never been, purely ‘conservative’ in the ‘right-wing’ sense attached to the Bush administration. To take only a current issue as an example, several well-known country artists, like Emmy Lou Harris, Willie Nelson and Haggard himself, have spoken out against the invasion of Iraq (Parvaz 2003), and there is a track record of prisoners’ rights activism among ‘hard’ country artists like Haggard, Johnny Cash and David Allen Coe. Nevertheless, country music is widely perceived to be overwhelmingly conservative, sometimes even reactionary, and current journalism and scholarship on the politics of the industry and its audiences would suggest that this perception is largely correct (Feiler 1996; Parvaz 2003; Rossman 2004; Fox 2004a, 2005), although the ‘conservatism’ in question is again more heterogeneous than its stereotype (DiMaggio, Peterson and Esco 1972; Fox 2004a, p. 324, note 5). 34. Lonestar's 2004 hit song ‘Mr. Mom’ describes a father who is at home because of a lay-off, but, rather than celebrating this upheaval in gender roles, the song expresses an increasing amazement at ‘how women do it’: ‘Honey, you're my hero’. 35. The fact that prior to the late 1960s country music was not associated with working-class living and values (Malone 2002, p. 45), contrary to the common notion that it has always been ‘working-class music’, demonstrates the ‘retroactive’ power of country music's rewriting its own past. 36. Stephanie Coontz's (2000) hilarious term for this family values turn in the US is ‘the way we never were’. 37. ‘What resources can an innovative class set against the formidable complex of trenches and fortification of the dominant class? The spirit of scission, in other words the progressive acquisition of the consciousness of its own historical personality, a spirit of scission that must aim to spread itself from the protagonist class to the classes that are its potential allies – all this requires a complex ideological labour, the first condition of which is an exact knowledge of the field that must be cleared of its element of human “mass”’. (Gramsci 1985, p. 390) 38. As Mladen Dolar (1993, p. 76) has written in his brilliant discussion of Althusser, ‘one becomes a subject by recognizing that one has always been a subject’.

Going Green in China: Firms’ Responses to Stricter Environmental Regulations,"This paper examines the effect of stringent environmental regulations on firms' environmental practices, economic performance, and environmental innovation.Reducing COD levels by 10% relative to 2005 levels is an aim of the Chinese 11th Five-Year Plan.Using a difference-indifferences framework based on a comprehensive firm-level dataset, we find that more stringent environmental regulations faced by firms are positively associated with a greater probability of reducing COD emissions; also, there exists an evident heterogeneous effect across industries with different pollution intensities.Stricter environmental regulations also account for the sharp decline in firms' profits, capital, and labor.After executing a complete chain of tests of the underlying mechanisms, we find that firms rely more on recycling and abatement investment than on innovations when meeting environmental requirements.",Haichao Fan; Huanhuan Wang; Joshua Graff Zivin; Joshua S.

Global Pricing of Carbon‐Transition Risk,"ABSTRACT The energy transition away from fossil fuels exposes companies to carbon‐transition risk. Estimating the market‐based premium associated with carbon‐transition risk in a cross section of 14,400 firms in 77 countries, we find higher stock returns associated with higher levels and growth rates of carbon emissions in all sectors and most countries. Carbon premia related to emissions growth are greater for firms located in countries with lower economic development, larger energy sectors, and less inclusive political systems.

Finance and Carbon Emissions,"We study the relation between the structure of financial systems and carbon emissions in a large panel of countries and industries over the period 1990-2013. We find that for given levels of economic and financial development and environmental regulation, CO2 emissions per capita are lower in economies that are relatively more equity-funded. Industry-level analysis reveals two distinct channels. First, stock markets reallocate investment towards less polluting sectors. Second, they also push carbon-intensive sectors to develop and implement greener technologies. In line with this second effect, we show that carbon-intensive sectors produce more green patents as stock markets deepen. We also document an increase in carbon emissions associated with the production of imported goods equal to around one-tenth of the reduction in domestic carbon emissions.",A. A. Popov; Alexander A.

International Spillover Effects of Air Pollution: Evidence from Mortality and Health Data,"We study the international spillover effects of air pollution by developing a framework that integrates recent advances in atmospheric science into econometric estimation with microdata on mortality and health.Combining transboundary particle trajectory data with the universe of individual-level mortality and emergency room visit data in South Korea, we find that transboundary air pollution from China significantly increases mortality and morbidity in South Korea.Using these estimates, we show that a recent Chinese environmental policy ""war on pollution"" generated a substantial international spillover benefit.Finally, we examine China's strategic pollution reductions and provide their implications for the potential Coasian bargaining.",Koichiro Ito; Rao Kotamarthi; Seonmin Will Heo; V.

The Environmental Bias of Trade Policy*,"Abstract This article describes a new fact, then analyzes its causes and consequences: in most countries, import tariffs and nontariff barriers are substantially lower on dirty than on clean industries, where an industry’s “dirtiness” is defined as its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per dollar of output. This difference in trade policy creates a global implicit subsidy to CO2 emissions in internationally traded goods and contributes to climate change. This global implicit subsidy to CO2 emissions totals several hundred billion dollars annually. The greater protection of downstream industries, which are relatively clean, substantially accounts for this pattern. The downstream pattern can be explained by theories where industries lobby for low tariffs on their inputs but final consumers are poorly organized. A quantitative general equilibrium model suggests that if countries applied similar trade policies to clean and dirty goods, global CO2 emissions would decrease and global real income would change little.",Joseph S Shapiro; Joseph Shapiro,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjaa042,"Subsidy, Downstream (manufacturing), Economics, Liberian dollar, Upstream (networking), International economics, Climate change, International trade, General equilibrium theory, Macroeconomics, Market economy, Computer network, Operations management, Finance, Computer science, Ecology, Biology","University of California, Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research","University of California, Berkeley, and National Bureau of Economic Research, United States","University of California, Berkeley, and National Bureau of Economic Research, United States"
Do Environmental Markets Cause Environmental Injustice? Evidence from California's Carbon Market,"Market-based environmental policies are widely adopted on the basis of allocative efficiency.However, there is growing concern that market-induced spatial reallocation of pollution could widen existing pollution concentration gaps between disadvantaged and other communities.We examine how this\environmental justice"" (EJ) gap changed following the 2013 introduction of California's carbon market, the world's second largest and the most subjected to EJ critiques.We estimate that the program lowered GHG, PM2:5, PM10, and NOx emissions by 3-9% annually between 2012-2017 for sample industrial facilities regulated only by the carbon market.Using a pollution dispersal model to characterize resulting spatial changes in pollution concentrations, we find the program caused EJ gaps in PM2:5, PM10, and NOx from these facilities to narrow by 6-10% annually.We demonstrate that explicit modeling of pollution dispersal is critical for detecting these results.",Danae Hernandez-Cortes; Danae Hernández-Cortés; Kyle C.

US Water Pollution Regulation over the Last Half Century: Burning Waters to Crystal Springs?,"In the half century since the founding of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, public and private U.S. sources have spent nearly $5 trillion ($2017) to provide clean rivers, lakes, and drinking water, or annual spending of 0.8 percent of U.S. GDP in most years.Yet over half of rivers and substantial shares of drinking water systems violate standards, and polls for decades have listed water pollution as Americans' number one environmental concern.We assess the history, effectiveness, and efficiency of the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act, and obtain four main conclusions.First, water pollution has fallen since these laws, in part due to their interventions.Second, investments made under these laws could be more cost-effective.Third, most recent studies estimate benefits of cleaning up pollution in rivers and lakes which are less than their costs, though these studies may under-count several potentially important types of benefits.Analysis finds more positive net benefits of drinking water quality investments.Fourth, economic research and teaching on water pollution is relatively uncommon, as measured by samples of publications, conference presentations, and textbooks.",David A.

Coal-Fired Power Plant Retirements in the U.S.,"We summarize the history of U.S. coal-fired plant retirements over the last decade, describe planned future retirements, and forecast the remaining operating life for every operating coalfired generator.We summarize the technology and location trends that are correlated with the observed retirements.We then describe a theoretical model of the retirement decision coal generator owners face.We use retirements from the last decade to quantify the relationships in the model for retired generators.Our model predicts that three-quarters of coal generation capacity will retire in the next twenty years, with most of that retirement concentrated in the next five years.Policy has limited ability to affect retirement times.A $20 per MWh electricity subsidy extends the average life of a generator by six years.A $51 per ton carbon tax brings forward retirement dates by about two years.In all scenarios, a handful of electricity generators remain on the grid beyond our forecast horizon.",Charles Sims; J.

The Value of Face-to-Face: Search and Contracting Problems in Nigerian Trade,"Distance between buyers and sellers can create search and contracting problems: how to find out what goods are available in far away places, and ensure they are actually delivered? Traveling to do business in person is one way of dealing with both, transforming a remote transaction into one that is face-to-face. I estimate the magnitude of search and contracting frictions in a developing country context by exploiting the fact that travel is a common, costly, and easily observable strategy for coping with them. I collect transaction-level panel data from Nigerian importers of consumer goods that combines the ""what"" of trade (e.g. products, quantities) with variables describing ""how"" trade is conducted (e.g. travel, payment terms). To account for patterns inconsistent with a full information environment, I build and estimate a model that embeds a search problem and a repeated game with moral hazard into a monopolistically competitive trade framework. Welfare from imported consumer goods would be 29% higher in the absence of both frictions. I decompose the total barrier into parts attributable to search and to contracting, and show why the effects will be larger in markets with low consumer spending, high firm entry/exit rates, and frequently changing products. The results suggest that greater attention to market integration policies beyond transportation and tariffs could have large welfare effects, particularly in developing countries. In counterfactual scenarios, I show that regulation of air travel between Nigeria and China would yield gains in Nigeria on the order of $650 million per year through consumer goods trade alone, while existing financial services do little to mitigate frictions because they do not offer a better contract enforcement technology than travel or repeated interaction.",Meredith Startz,,,,,,,,,,,,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3096685,"Face (sociological concept), Value (mathematics), Face value, Business, Computer science, Sociology, Machine learning, Finance, Social science",Princeton University; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Princeton University - International Economics Section; Stanford University - Department of Economics,National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Princeton University - International Economics Section; Stanford University - Department of Economics
Gravity and Extended Gravity: Using Moment Inequalities to Estimate a Model of Export Entry,"Exporting firms often enter foreign markets that are similar to previous export destinations.We develop a dynamic model in which a firm's exports in a market may depend on how similar the market is to the firm's home country (gravity) and to its previous export destinations (extended gravity).Given the large number of export paths from which forward-looking firms may choose, we use a moment inequality approach to structurally estimate our model.Using data from Chilean exporters, we estimate that having similarities with a prior export destination in geographic location, language, and income per capita jointly reduce the cost of foreign market entry by 69% to 90%.Reductions due to geographic location (25% to 38%) and language (29% to 36%) have the largest effect.Extended gravity thus has a large impact on export entry costs.",Andrés Zahler; Eduardo Morales; Gloria Sheu,,,,,,,,,,,,2014.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w19916,"Gravity model of trade, Moment (physics), Inequality, Gravity equation, Geodesy, Econometrics, Geology, Mathematics, Economics, Physics, Geography, International economics, Bilateral trade, Classical mechanics, Mathematical analysis, Archaeology, China",Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris; National Bureau of Economic Research; Diego Portales University; Boston College; University of Chicago; Princeton University; UCLA Health,"ERWIT, Harvard, LSE, MIT, NBER, Princeton, Sciences-Po, SED,; Universidad Diego Portales; University of Chicago-Booth, Wisconsin,; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; UCLA,; Boston College, Brandeis, Columbia, CREI, Duke,; Department of Economics Princeton University 310 Fisher Hall Princeton, NJ 08544 and; Department of Justice","ERWIT, Harvard, LSE, MIT, NBER, Princeton, Sciences-Po, SED,; Universidad Diego Portales; University of Chicago-Booth, Wisconsin,; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; UCLA,; Department of Economics Princeton University 310 Fisher Hall Princeton, NJ 08544 and; Boston College, Brandeis, Columbia, CREI, Duke,; Department of Justice"

The Origins of Firm Heterogeneity: A Production Network Approach,"This paper quantifies the origins of firm size heterogeneity when firms are interconnected in a production network. Using the universe of buyer-supplier relationships in Belgium, the paper develops a set of stylized facts that motivate a model in which firms buy inputs from upstream suppliers and sell to downstream buyers and final demand. Larger firm size can come from high production capability, more or better buyers and suppliers, and/or better matches between buyers and suppliers. Downstream factors explain the vast majority of firm size heterogeneity. Firms with higher production capability have greater market shares among their customers, but also higher input costs and fewer customers. As a result, high production capability firms have lower sales unconditionally and higher sales conditional on their input prices. Counterfactual analysis suggests that the production network accounts for more than half of firm size dispersion. Taken together, our results suggest that multiple firm attributes underpin their success or failure, and that models with only one source of firm heterogeneity fail to capture the majority of firm size dispersion.",Andreas Moxnes; Andrew B.

Trade Crisis? What Trade Crisis?,"We investigate the 2008–2009 trade collapse using microdata from a small open economy, Belgium. Belgian exports and imports mostly fell because of smaller quantities sold and unit prices charged rather than fewer firms, trading partners, and products being involved in trade. Our difference-in-difference results point to a fall in the demand for tradables as the main driver of the collapse. Finance and involvement in global value chains played a minor role. Firm-level exports-to-turnover and imports-to-intermediates ratios reveal a comparable collapse of domestic and cross-border operations.

The Limits of Financial Globalization,"ABSTRACT Despite the dramatic reduction in explicit barriers to international investment activity over the last 60 years, the impact of financial globalization has been surprisingly limited. I argue that country attributes are still critical to financial decision‐making because of “twin agency problems” that arise because rulers of sovereign states and corporate insiders pursue their own interests at the expense of outside investors. When these twin agency problems are significant, diffuse ownership is inefficient and corporate insiders must co‐invest with other investors, retaining substantial equity. The resulting ownership concentration limits economic growth, financial development, and the ability of a country to take advantage of financial globalization.",RENÉ M. STULZ; René M.

In contrast to the prevailing wisdom, I argue that the textbook theory of liberalization holds up quite well to a critical reading of this literature. Most papers that find no effect of liberalization on real variables tell us nothing about the empirical validity of the theory because they do not really test it. This paper explains why it is that most studies do not really address the theory they set out to test. It also discusses what is necessary to test the theory and examines papers that have done so.

Labor Markets and Monetary Policy: A New Keynesian Model with Unemployment,"We construct a utility-based model of fluctuations with nominal rigidities and unemployment. We first show that under a standard utility specification, productivity shocks have no effect on unemployment in the constrained efficient allocation. That property is also shown to hold, despite labor market frictions, in the decentralized equilibrium under flexible prices and wages. Inefficient unemployment fluctuations arise when we introduce real-wage rigidities. As a result, in the presence of staggered price setting by firms, the central bank faces a trade-off between inflation and unemployment stabilization, which depends on labor market characteristics. We draw the implications for optimal monetary policy.

"Agency Conflicts, Investment, and Asset Pricing","ABSTRACT The separation of ownership and control allows controlling shareholders to pursue private benefits. We develop an analytically tractable dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model to study asset pricing and welfare implications of imperfect investor protection. Consistent with empirical evidence, the model predicts that countries with weaker investor protection have more incentives to overinvest, lower Tobin's q , higher return volatility, larger risk premia, and higher interest rate. Calibrating the model to the Korean economy reveals that perfecting investor protection increases the stock market's value by 22%, a gain for which outside shareholders are willing to pay 11% of their capital stock.",NENG WANG; Neng Wang; RUI ALBUQUERUE,,,,,,,,,,,,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01309.x,"Capital asset pricing model, Shareholder, Private benefits of control, Economics, Stock (firearms), Incentive, Volatility (finance), Monetary economics, Consumption-based capital asset pricing model, Risk premium, Risk-free interest rate, Financial economics, Business, Microeconomics, Finance, Corporate governance, Mechanical engineering, Engineering",Bank of Canada; Centre for Economic Policy Research; Boston University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"(UBC/Bank of Canada conference discussant),; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Boston University School of Management 595 Commonwealth Avenue Boston, MA 02215;  Centre for Economic Policy Research; 2004 SED (Florence), 2005 CEPR/ Gerzensee, 2005 WFA (Portland), UBC/Bank of Canada conference","(UBC/Bank of Canada conference discussant),; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Boston University School of Management 595 Commonwealth Avenue Boston, MA 02215;  Centre for Economic Policy Research; 2004 SED (Florence), 2005 CEPR/ Gerzensee, 2005 WFA (Portland), UBC/Bank of Canada conference"
Sustainable and Dynamic Competitiveness towards Technological Leadership of Industry 4.0: Implications for East African Community,"The war to technology and economic powers has been the driver for industrialization in most developed countries. The first industrial revolution (industry 1.0) earned millions for textile mill owners, while the second industrial revolution (industry 2.0) opened the way for tycoons and captains of industry such as Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller, and J.P. Morgan. The third industrial revolution (industry 3.0) engendered technology giants such as Apple and Microsoft and made magnates of men such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. Now, the race for the fourth industrial revolution (industry 4.0) is on and there is no option, and every country whether developed or developing must participate. Many countries have positively responded to industry 4.0 by developing strategic initiatives to strengthen industry 4.0 implementation. Unlocking the country’s potential to industry 4.0 has been of interest to researchers in the recent past. However, the extent to which industry 4.0 initiatives are being launched globally has never been divulged. Therefore, the present study aimed at exploring industry 4.0 initiatives through a comprehensive electronic survey of the literature to estimate the extent of their launching in different regions. Inferences were drawn from industry 4.0 initiatives in developed nations to be used as the recommendations for the East African Community. Results of the survey revealed that 117 industry 4.0 initiatives have been launched in 56 countries worldwide consisting of five regions: Europe (37%), North America (28%), Asia and Oceania (17%), Latin America and the Caribbean (10%), and Middle East and Africa (8%). The worldwide percentage was estimated as 25%. This revealed that there is a big gap existing between countries in the race for industry 4.0.",Emmanuel Hitiyise; Eric Oyondi Nganyi; Godias Tumusiime; Mfanga Ramadhani Abswaidi; Ocident Bongomin,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8545281,"Industrialisation, Industrial Revolution, Latin Americans, Developing country, Economic growth, Business, Political science, Economy, Economics, Market economy, Law",University of Rwanda; Moi University; Busitema University; Moshi Co-operative University,"Department of Polymer, Industrial and Textile Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Busitema University, P.O.

How federally insured reverse mortgages affect the credit outcomes of older adults,"Abstract This study examines how the extraction of home equity through the federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) affects the credit outcomes of older adults. We use data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York/Equifax Consumer Credit Panel, supplemented with a unique credit panel data set of reverse mortgage borrowers. Using matched sample difference‐in‐differences with individual fixed effects, we estimate credit outcomes for older adults who borrowed through a HECM between 2008 and 2011, relative to older homeowners not borrowing from home equity. Our results indicate that the HECM is associated with a short‐term reduction in revolving credit card debt, as well as a reduction in the probability of bankruptcy. We find some evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects, where older adults with higher levels of consumer debt prior to originating a HECM experience larger subsequent declines in debt, increases in credit score, and steeper reductions in bankruptcy rates.",Donald Haurin; Donald R.

Private bankruptcy in the Russian Federation: reality and perspectives,"The research is dedicated to a number of problematic areas in implementing a social function of individual bankruptcy. Crisis events of 2020 required measures from many states intended to support both large and small businesses and individual citizens. Personal bankruptcy as a legal tool provides an opportunity for persons with financial hardships to be legally released from further fulfillment of creditor claims. Along with that, it becomes more and more relevant to overcome bureaucratic, financial and other barriers to exercise rights and legal interests of consumers in this area. The paper is intended to identify a number of problems impeding the implementation of the social function of private bankruptcy and to develop possible solutions during the discussion. These issues were addressed based on regulatory and scientific sources containing relevant information on the institute of private bankruptcy using a number of general scientific (analysis, induction) and particular scientific (formally legal) methods. The research resulted in a list of primary problematic aspects in legal regulation and practice of private bankruptcy in the Russian Federation impeding the implementation of the social function of this institute. Solutions are proposed for discussion, which are related to financing private bankruptcy, abuse of the creditor right, low level of population awareness of the ways, methods and consequences of solving issues connected with overdue debts. This paper presents an overview of primary problematic aspects and their solutions. Each aspect will be considered in more detail in future researches.",Anatolii Nikolayevich Mironov; V.M.

"Invention Value, Inventive Capability and the Large Firm Advantage","Do large firms produce more valuable inventions, and if so, why? After confirming that large firms indeed produce more valuable inventions, we consider two possible sources: a superior ability to invent, or a superior ability to extract value from their inventions. We develop a simple model that discriminates between the two explanations. Using a sample of 2,786 public corporations, and measures of both patent quality and patent value, we find that, while average invention value rises with size, average invention quality declines, suggesting, per our model, that the large firm advantage is not due to superior inventive capability, but due to the superior ability to extract value. We provide evidence suggesting that this superior ability to extract value is due to greater commercialization capabilities of larger firms.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",Ashish Arora; Divya Sebastian; Honggi Lee; Wesley M.

Going Bankrupt in China,"Abstract Using a new case-level dataset, we document a set of stylized facts on bankruptcy in China and study how the staggered introduction of specialized courts across Chinese cities affected insolvency resolution and the local economy. For identification, we compare bankruptcy cases handled by specialized versus traditional civil courts within the same city and filed in the same year. We find that specialized courts decrease case duration by 36% relative to traditional civil courts. We provide evidence consistent with court specialization increasing efficiency via selection of better trained judges and higher judicial independence from local politicians. We document that cities introducing specialized courts experience a relative reallocation of employment out of zombie firms-intensive sectors, as well as faster firm entry and a larger increase in average capital productivity.",Bo Li; Jacopo Ponticelli,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/rof/rfab023,"Stylized fact, Bankruptcy, Insolvency, China, Productivity, Capital (architecture), Business, Independence (probability theory), Total factor productivity, Identification (biology), Judicial independence, Economics, Finance, Political science, Law, Macroeconomics, Geography, Statistics, Botany, Mathematics, Archaeology, Biology, Politics",Tsinghua University; Kellogg's (Canada),"Tsinghua University PBC School of Finance; Northwestern University Kellogg School of Management, NBER and CEPR","Tsinghua University PBC School of Finance; Northwestern University Kellogg School of Management, NBER and CEPR"
A Survey of Private Debt Funds,"Despite its large and increasing size in the U.S. and Europe, there is relatively little research on the private debt (PD) market, particularly compared to the bank and syndicated loan markets.Accordingly, in this paper, we survey U.S. and European investors with private debt assets under management (AuM) of over $300 billion.These investors are primarily direct lending funds.We ask the general partners (GPs) how they source, select, and evaluate deals, how they think of private debt relative to bank and syndicated loan financing, how they monitor their investments, how they interact with private equity (PE) sponsors and how they view the future of the market.The respondents provide primarily cash flow-based loans and believe that they finance companies and leverage levels that banks would not fund.The direct lending funds target unlevered returns that appear high relative to their risk.They use leverage in their funds, but appreciably less than banks and collateralized loan obligation funds (CLOs).They use and negotiate for both financial and incurrence covenants to monitor their investments.The presence of PE sponsors helps them lend more and craft more effective covenants.U.S. and European funds are similar on many dimensions, but the European funds rely less on PE sponsors and compete more with banks.Overall, the private debt market is both different from, but shares characteristics with the bank loan and syndicated loan markets.",Anna Schulze; Joern Block; Steven A.

Asset Specificity of Nonfinancial Firms,"Abstract We develop a new data set to study asset specificity among nonfinancial firms. Our data cover the liquidation values of each category of assets on firms’ balance sheets and provides information across major industries. First, we find that nonfinancial firms have high asset specificity. For example, the liquidation value of fixed assets is 35% of the net book value in the average industry. Second, we analyze the determinants of asset specificity and document that assets’ physical attributes (e.g., mobility, durability, and customization) play a crucial role. Third, we investigate several implications. Consistent with theories of investment irreversibility, high asset specificity is associated with less disinvestment and stronger effects of uncertainty on investment activities. We also find that the increasing prevalence of intangible assets has not significantly reduced firms’ liquidation values.",Amir Kermani; Yueran Ma,,,,,,,,,,,,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjac030,"Asset (computer security), Business, Balance sheet, Disinvestment, Value (mathematics), Intangible asset, Investment (military), Fixed asset, Asset specificity, Book value, Finance, Financial economics, Monetary economics, Industrial organization, Economics, Microeconomics, Production (economics), Transaction cost, Incentive, Computer security, Earnings, Machine learning, Politics, Computer science, Political science, Law","University of Chicago; University of California, Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research","University of Chicago, Booth School of Business and National Bureau of Economic Research , United States; University of California, Berkeley Haas School of Business and National Bureau of Economic Research , United States","University of Chicago, Booth School of Business and National Bureau of Economic Research , United States; University of California, Berkeley Haas School of Business and National Bureau of Economic Research , United States"
Bankrupt Innovative Firms,"We study how innovative firms manage their innovation portfolios after filing for Chapter 11 reorganization using three decades of data. We find that they sell off core (i.e., technologically critical and valuable), rather than peripheral, patents in bankruptcy. The selling pattern is driven almost entirely by firms with greater use of secured debt, and the mechanism is secured creditors exercising their control rights on collateralized patents. Creditor-driven patent sales in bankruptcy have implications for technology diffusion—the sold patents diffuse more slowly under new ownership and are more likely to be purchased by patent trolls.

The Agglomeration of Urban Amenities: Evidence from Milan Restaurants,"We estimate agglomeration externalities in Milan’s restaurant sector using the abolition of a unique regulation that restricted where restaurants could locate. In 2005, Milan abolished a minimum distance requirement that had kept the number of establishments artificially constant across neighborhoods. We find that after 2005, the geographical concentration of restaurants increased sharply and at an accelerating rate. Consistent with the existence of strong and self-sustaining agglomeration externalities, restaurants agglomerated in some neighborhoods and deserted others, leading to a growing divergence in local amenities across neighborhoods. Restaurants located in neighborhoods that experienced large increases in agglomeration reacted by increasing product differentiation.

Overlapping Climate Policies,"The world is under pressure to deliver on the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.Individual jurisdictions are enacting policies such as phasing out coal, taxing aviation, and supporting renewable energy.These often overlap with a wider multi-jurisdictional carbon-pricing system like the EU's Emissions Trading System.We develop a general framework to study how such ""overlapping climate policies"" can help combat climate change-depending on their design, location and timing.Some policies are truly complementary while others backfire by raising aggregate emissions.At a conceptual level, our model encompasses most carbon-pricing systems used in practice and a wide range of popular unilateral policies.",Arthur van Benthem; Grischa Perino; Robert Ritz,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w25643,"Business, Computer science",National Bureau of Economic Research; Universität Hamburg; University of Pennsylvania; University of Cambridge,"University of Hamburg Welckerstr. 8 20354 Hamburg Germany; Energy Policy Research Group Judge Business School University of Cambridge Trumpington Street Cambridge CB2 1AG United Kingdom; School of Regulation at the European University Institute, and the University of Pennsylvania.; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; The Wharton School University of Pennsylvania 327 Vance Hall 3733 Spruce Street Philadelphia, PA 19104","University of Hamburg Welckerstr. 8 20354 Hamburg Germany; Energy Policy Research Group Judge Business School University of Cambridge Trumpington Street Cambridge CB2 1AG United Kingdom; School of Regulation at the European University Institute, and the University of Pennsylvania.; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; The Wharton School University of Pennsylvania 327 Vance Hall 3733 Spruce Street Philadelphia, PA 19104"

China's Unconventional Nationwide CO₂ Emissions Trading System: The Wide-Ranging Impacts of an Implicit Output Subsidy,"China is planning to implement the largest CO 2 emissions trading system in the world.To reduce emissions, the system will be a tradable performance standard (TPS), an emissions pricing mechanism that differs significantly from the emissions pricing instruments used in other countries, such as cap and trade (C&T) and a carbon tax.We employ matching analytically and numerically solved models to assess the cost-effectiveness and distributional impacts of China's forthcoming TPS for achieving CO 2 emissions reductions from the power sector.We find that the TPS's implicit subsidy to electricity output has wide-ranging consequences for both cost-effectiveness and distribution.In terms of cost-effectiveness, the subsidy disadvantages the TPS relative to C&T by causing power plants to make less efficient use of output-reduction as a way of reducing emissions (indeed, it induces some generators to increase output) and by limiting the cost-reducing potential of allowance trading.In our central case simulations, TPS's overall costs are about 47 percent higher than under C&T.At the same time, the TPS has distribution-related attractions.Through the use of multiple benchmarks (maximal emissionoutput ratios consistent with compliance), it can serve distributional objectives.And because it yields smaller increases in electricity prices than a comparable C&T system, it implies less international emissions leakage.",Jieyi Lu; Lawrence Goulder; Lawrence H.

Quality-Adjusted Price Measurement: A New Approach with Evidence from Semiconductors,"Many markets exhibit price dispersion across suppliers of observationally identical goods. Statistical agencies typically assume this dispersion reflects unobserved quality, so standard price indexes do not incorporate price declines when buyers substitute toward lower-price suppliers. We show that long-run price differences across suppliers can be used to infer unobserved quality differences and propose an index that accommodates quality-adjusted price dispersion. Using transaction-level data on contract semiconductor manufacturing, we document substantial quality-adjusted price dispersion and confirm that a standard index is biased above our proposed index.",Brian K.

"Outsourcing Supply Contracts, Human Capital and Firm Capital Structure","We examine firm and industry characteristics associated with outsourcing and the relation between outsourcing and capital structure using a unique database of purchase contracts for a measure of firm outsourcing. We document firm, industry, and supplier characteristics that are significantly associated with outside purchase contracting. We find that supplier competition and distance impact the use of purchase contracts, along with firm growth options and value-added per worker. Examining the outside purchase contract and leverage decisions using simultaneous equations, we find that firms in competitive industries, with more growth options, that have suppliers farther away with higher competition are more likely to use purchase contracts but have less leverage. Our results are consistent with firms that choose to use purchase contracts using less leverage to mitigate the potential loss of relationship-specific investments of contacting parties that can occur with financial distress or bankruptcy.",Gordon M.

Measuring the Gig Economy: Current Knowledge and Open Issues,"The rise of the ""gig economy"" has attracted wide attention from both scholars and the popular media.Much of this attention has been devoted to jobs mediated through various online platforms.While non-traditional work arrangements have been a perennial subject of debate and study, the perception that new technology is producing an accelerated pace of change in the organization of work has fueled a resurgence of interest in how such changes may be affecting both workers and firms.This paper provides a typology of work arrangements and reviews how different arrangements, and especially gig activity, are captured in existing data.A challenge for understanding recent trends is that household survey and administrative data paint a different picture, with the former showing little evidence of the growth in self-employment that would be implied by a surge in gig activity and the latter providing evidence of considerable recent growth.An examination of matched individual-level survey and administrative records shows that a large and growing fraction of those with self-employment activity in administrative data have no such activity recorded in household survey data.The share of those with self-employment activity in household survey data but not administrative data is smaller and has not grown.Promising avenues for improving the measurement of self-employment activity include the addition of more probing questions to household survey questionnaires and the development of integrated data sets that combine survey, administrative and, potentially, private data.",James R.

How Did China’s WTO Entry Affect U.S. Prices?,"We analyze the effects of China's rapid export expansion following WTO entry on U.S. prices, exploiting cross-industry variation in trade liberalization.Lower input tariffs boosted Chinese firms' productivity, lowered costs, and, in conjunction with reduced U.S. tariff uncertainty, expanded export participation.We find that China's WTO entry significantly reduced varietyadjusted U.S. manufacturing price indexes between 2000 and 2006.For the Chinese components of these indexes, one third of the beneficial impact comes from Chinese exporters lowering their prices, while two-thirds of the beneficial impact comes from the entry of new Chinese exporters.China's WTO entry also led other countries exporting to the U.S. to lower their prices, which was partly offset by exit of these exporters.We find that this impact on competitor countries' prices is primarily explained by the reduction in China's own input tariffs, so that policy action becomes the largest source of welfare gain for the United States from China's WTO entry.",John Romalis; Mary Amiti; Mi Dai; Robert C.

Using Equity Market Reactions to Infer Exposure to Trade Liberalization,"We propose a method for identifying exposure to changes in trade policy based on asset prices that has several advantages over standard measures: it encompasses all avenues of exposure, it is natively firm-level, it yields estimates for both goods and service producers, and it can be used to study reductions in difficult-to-quantify non-tariff barriers in a way that controls naturally for broader macroeconomic shocks.Applying our method to two well-studied US trade liberalizations provides new insight into service sector responses to trade liberalizations as well as dramatically different responses among small versus large firms, even within narrow industries.",Andrew Greenland; John Lopresti; Mihai Ion; Peter K.

Misallocation in the Market for Inputs: Enforcement and the Organization of Production*,"Abstract The strength of contract enforcement determines how firms source inputs and organize production. Using microdata on Indian manufacturing plants, we show that production and sourcing decisions appear systematically distorted in states with weaker enforcement. Specifically, we document that in industries that tend to rely more heavily on relationship-specific intermediate inputs, plants in states with more-congested courts shift their expenditures away from intermediate inputs and have a greater vertical span of production. To quantify the effect of these distortions on aggregate productivity, we construct a model in which plants have several ways of producing, each with different bundles of inputs. Weak enforcement exacerbates a holdup problem that arises when using inputs that require customization, distorting both the intensive and extensive margins of input use. The equilibrium organization of production and the network structure of input-output linkages arise endogenously from the producers’ simultaneous cost-minimization decisions. We identify the structural parameters that govern enforcement frictions from cross-state variation in the first moments of producers’ cost shares. A set of counterfactuals show that enforcement frictions lower aggregate productivity to an extent that is relevant on the macro scale.",Ezra Oberfield; Johannes Boehm,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjaa020,"Microdata (statistics), Enforcement, Production (economics), Productivity, Industrial organization, Counterfactual conditional, Microeconomics, Economics, Econometrics, Returns to scale, Aggregate (composite), Business, Macroeconomics, Counterfactual thinking, Population, Philosophy, Materials science, Demography, Epistemology, Sociology, Political science, Law, Composite material, Census",Princeton University; London School of Economics and Political Science; Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris,"Princeton University (Princeton, NJ 08544 USA - United States); CEP - LSE - Centre for Economic Performance (Centre for Economic Performance

Combinatorial Discrete Choice,Discrete choice problems with complementarities are prevalent in economics but the large dimensionality of potential solutions substantially limits the scope of their application. We define and characterize a general class that we term combinatorial discrete choice problems and show that it covers many existing problems in economics and engineering. We propose single crossing differences (SCD) as the sufficient condition to guarantee that simple recursive procedures can find the global maximum. We introduce an algorithm motivated by this condition and show how it can be used to revisit problems whose computation was deemed infeasible before. We finally discuss results for a class of games characterized by these sufficient conditions.,Costas Arkolakis; Fabian Eckert,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3455353,"Computer science, Mathematics","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, San Diego; Yale University","National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Yale University - Department of Economics; Yale University - Cowles Foundation; University of California, San Diego (UCSD), Division of Social Sciences, Department of Economics","Yale University - Department of Economics; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Yale University - Cowles Foundation; University of California, San Diego (UCSD), Division of Social Sciences, Department of Economics"
O-Ring Production Networks,"We study a production network where quality choices are interconnected across firms.Highquality firms are skill intensive and trade more with other high-quality firms.Using data from Turkish firms, we document strong assortative matching of skills in the production network.A firm-specific export demand shock from a rich country increases the firm's skill intensity and shifts the firm toward skill-intensive domestic partners.We develop a quantitative model with heterogeneous firms, endogenous quality choices, and network formation.An economy-wide export demand shock of 5 percent induces exporters and non-exporters to upgrade quality, raising the average wage by 1.2 percent.This effect is about nine times the effect in a special case of the model with no interconnection of quality choices.",Ana Cecília Fieler; Banu Demir; Daniel Xu; Daniel Yi Xu; Kelly Kaili Yang,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w28433,"Ring (chemistry), Production (economics), Computer science, Chemistry, Economics, Organic chemistry, Macroeconomics",National Bureau of Economic Research; Yale University; Bilkent University; Duke University,"Yale University Department of Economics 27 Hillhouse Ave New Haven, CT 06511 and; Department of Economics Bilkent University 06800 Ankara Turkey; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Duke University 213 Social Science Bldg 419 Chapel Drive Box 90097 Durham, NC 27708-0097; Department of Economics Duke University 213 Social Sciences Building 419 Chapel Drive, Box 90097 Durham, NC 27708","Yale University Department of Economics 27 Hillhouse Ave New Haven, CT 06511 and; Department of Economics Bilkent University 06800 Ankara Turkey; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Duke University 213 Social Science Bldg 419 Chapel Drive Box 90097 Durham, NC 27708-0097; Department of Economics Duke University 213 Social Sciences Building 419 Chapel Drive, Box 90097 Durham, NC 27708"
Firm Export Dynamics in Interdependent Markets,"We estimate a model of firm export dynamics featuring cross-country complementarities.The firm decides where to export by solving a dynamic combinatorial discrete choice problem, for which we develop a solution algorithm that overcomes the computational challenges inherent to the large dimensionality of its state space and choice set.According to our estimated model, firms enjoy cost reductions when exporting to countries geographically or linguistically close to each other, or that share deep trade agreements; and countries, especially small ones, sharing these traits with attractive destinations receive significantly more exports than in the absence of complementarities.",Alonso Alfaro-Urena; Alonso Alfaro-Ureña; Eduardo A.

Weathering the Storm: Supply Chains and Climate Risk,"We characterize how firms structure supply chains under climate risk.Using new data on the universe of firm-to-firm transactions from an Indian state, we show that firms diversify sourcing locations, and suppliers exposed to climate risk charge lower prices.Our event-study analysis finds that firms with suppliers in flood-affected districts experience a decline in inputs lasting two months, followed by a return to original suppliers.We develop a general equilibrium model of firm input sourcing under climate risk.Firms diversify identical inputs from suppliers across space, trading off the probability of a climate shock against higher input costs.We quantify the model using data on 271 Indian districts, showing real wages vary across space and are correlated with geography and productivity.Wages are inversely correlated with sourcing risk, giving rise to a cost minimization-resilience tradeoff.Supply chain diversification unambiguously reduces real wage volatility, but ambiguously affects their levels, as diversification may come with higher input costs.While diversification helps mitigate climate risk, it exacerbates the distributional effects of climate change by reducing wages in regions prone to more frequent shocks.",Gaurav Khanna; Juanma Castro-Vincenzi; Nicolas Morales; Nitya Pandalai-Nayar,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w32218,"Storm, Weathering, Environmental science, Supply chain, Climate change, Earth science, Geology, Climatology, Business, Geochemistry, Oceanography, Marketing","The University of Texas at Austin; Harvard University; Center for Economic and Policy Research; University of California, San Diego; National Bureau of Economic Research; Conference Board; Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond; Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis","Department of Economics Harvard University 1805 Cambridge Street Littauer Center 211 Cambridge, Mass 02138; conference; participants at Michigan, St Louis Fed, and Kiel-; CEPR Geopolitics; Department of Economics University of Texas at Austin 3.142 BRB, 2225 Speedway Austin, TX 78713; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond 701 E Byrd St Richmond, VA 23219; School of Global Policy and Strategy University of California, San Diego 9500 Gilman Drive La Jolla, Cali 92093 United States","Department of Economics Harvard University 1805 Cambridge Street Littauer Center 211 Cambridge, Mass 02138; conference; participants at Michigan, St Louis Fed, and Kiel-; CEPR Geopolitics; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of Texas at Austin 3.142 BRB, 2225 Speedway Austin, TX 78713; Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond 701 E Byrd St Richmond, VA 23219; School of Global Policy and Strategy University of California, San Diego 9500 Gilman Drive La Jolla, Cali 92093 United States"
The Gains from Input Trade in Firm-Based Models of Importing,"Trade in intermediate inputs allows firms to lower their costs of production by using better, cheaper, or novel inputs from abroad.Quantifying the aggregate impact of input trade, however, is challenging.As importing firms differ markedly in how much they buy in foreign markets, results based on aggregate models do not apply.We develop a methodology to quantify the gains from input trade for a class of firm-based models of importing.We derive a sufficiency result: the change in consumer prices induced by input trade is fully determined from the joint distribution of value added and domestic expenditure shares in material spending across firms.We provide a simple formula that can be readily evaluated given the micro-data.In an application to French data, we find that consumer prices of manufacturing products would be 27% higher in the absence of input trade.",Claire LeLarge; Claire Lelarge; Joaquin Blaum; Michael Peters,,,,,,,,,,,,2015.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w21504,"Business, Industrial organization, International trade, Economics, Computer science, International economics",Yale University; Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques; Centre de Recherche en Économie et Statistique; Brown University; Pennsylvania State University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies Direction des Études et Synthèses Économiques 15 Boulevard Gabriel Peri 92244 Malakoff Cedex, France and CREST; Department of Economics Yale University 28 Hillhouse Avenue New Haven, CT 06511 and; Columbia, Dartmouth, LSE, Penn State, Princeton, Stanford,; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Waterman Street Box B, Brown University Providence, RI 02912","National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies Direction des Études et Synthèses Économiques 15 Boulevard Gabriel Peri 92244 Malakoff Cedex, France and CREST; Department of Economics Yale University 28 Hillhouse Avenue New Haven, CT 06511 and; Columbia, Dartmouth, LSE, Penn State, Princeton, Stanford,; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Waterman Street Box B, Brown University Providence, RI 02912"

"Outsourcing, Inequality and Aggregate Output","Outsourced workers experience large wage declines, yet domestic outsourcing may raise aggregate productivity.To study this equity-efficiency trade-off, we contribute a framework in which multi-worker firms either hire imperfectly substitutable worker types in-house along a wage ladder, or rent labor services from contractors who hire in the same frictional labor markets.Three implications arise.First, selection into outsourcing: more productive firms are more likely to outsource to save on labor costs and higher wage premia.Second, a productivity effect: outsourcing leads firms to raise output and labor demand.Third, an outsourcing wage penalty: contractor firms pay lower wages.We find support for all three implications in French administrative data and rule out alternative explanations.Instrumenting revenue productivity using export demand shocks, we find evidence for selection into outsourcing.Instrumenting outsourcing using variation in occupational exposure, we find evidence for the productivity effect.We confirm the outsourcing wage penalty with a movers design.After structurally estimating the model and validating it against our reduced-form estimates, we find that the rise in outsourcing in France between 1997 and 2016 lowers low skill service worker earnings and welfare by 1.5%.Outsourcing increases labor market sorting, lowers the share of rents going to workers, but raises aggregate output by 6%.A simultaneous 5.5% minimum wage hike stabilizes earnings and maintains employment and output gains.",Adrien Bilal; Hugo Lhuillier,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w29348,"Outsourcing, Aggregate (composite), Inequality, Business, Industrial organization, Economics, Mathematics, Marketing, Materials science, Composite material, Mathematical analysis",National Bureau of Economic Research; Princeton University; Harvard University Press,"Department of Economics Princeton University Princeton, NJ 08544; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Harvard University 1805 Cambridge Street Cambridge, MA 02138 and","Department of Economics Princeton University Princeton, NJ 08544; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Harvard University 1805 Cambridge Street Cambridge, MA 02138 and"
Firm Heterogeneity and the Impact of Immigration: Evidence from German Establishments,"We use a detailed establishment-level dataset from Germany to document a new dimension of firm heterogeneity: large firms spend a higher share of their wage bill on immigrants than small firms.We show analytically that ignoring this heterogeneity in the immigrant share leads to biased estimates of the welfare gains from immigration.To do so, we set up and estimate a model where heterogeneous firms choose their immigrant share and then use it to quantify the welfare effects of an increase in the number of immigrants in Germany.Two new adjustment mechanisms arise under firm heterogeneity.First, native workers reallocate across firms, which mitigates the competition effect between immigrants and natives in the labor market.Second, the gains are largely concentrated among the largest and most productive employers, which induces an additional aggregate productivity gain.If we ignore the heterogeneity in the immigrant share across firms, we would underestimate the welfare gains of native workers by 11%.",Agostina Brinatti; Nicolas Morales,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.21144/wp21-16,"Immigration, Welfare, Productivity, German, Economics, Labour economics, Competition (biology), Wage, Demographic economics, Market share, Market economy, Archaeology, History, Ecology, Finance, Biology, Macroeconomics",Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond; University of Michigan–Ann Arbor,"University of Michigan,; Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond,","University of Michigan,; Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond,"
Rethinking deindustrialization,"Manufacturing in high-income countries is on the decline and Denmark is no exception. Manufacturing employment and the number of firms have been shrinking as a share of the total and in absolute levels. This paper uses a rich linked employer-employee dataset to examine this decline from 1994 to 2007. We propose a different approach to analyze deindustrialization and generate a series of novel stylized facts about the evolution. While most of the decline can be attributed to firm exit and reduced employment at surviving manufacturers, we document that a non-negligible portion is due to firms switching industries, from manufacturing to services. We focus on this last group of firms before, during, and after their sector switch. Overall this is a group of small, highly productive, import intensive firms that grow rapidly in terms of value-added and sales after they switch. By 2007, employment at these former manufacturers equals 8.7 percent of manufacturing employment, accounting for half the decline in manufacturing employment. We focus on the composition of the workforce as firms make their transition. In addition, we identify two types of switchers: one group resembles traditional wholesalers and another group that retains and expands their R&D and technical capabilities. Our findings emphasize that the focus on employment at manufacturing firms overstates the loss in manufacturing-related capabilities that are actually retained in many firms that switch industries.",Andrew B.

"Automation, labor share, and productivity: plant-level evidence from U.S. manufacturing","This paper provides direct evidence of automation's role in production using establishment-level data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Manufacturing Technology. The data indicate that more automated plants have lower production labor share and higher capital share, higher labor productivity, and a smaller fraction of workers in production who receive higher wages. To understand the connection between automation and total factor productivity, we estimate a CES model of production where a plant chooses the degree of automation by adjusting the relative weight of capital and production labor given their relative price. The results indicate that, in the presence of heterogeneity in the extent of automation, productivity estimates are more dispersed and skewed relative to Cobb-Douglas residuals, and that the choice of functional form affects the level of productivity estimates. Overall, broad and deep automation is concentrated in larger plants with higher total factor productivity and lower labor share, consistent with a role for automation in contributing to dispersion in input utilization and market share.",Emin Dinlersoz; Zoltan Wolf; Zoltán Wolf,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.1080/10438599.2023.2233081,"Productivity, Production (economics), Economics, Automation, Wage share, Labour economics, Capital (architecture), Total factor productivity, Market share, Industrial organization, Microeconomics, Engineering, Wage, Economic growth, Efficiency wage, Geography, Mechanical engineering, Archaeology, Finance",United States Census Bureau; New Light Industries (United States),"Center for Economic Studies, U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC, USA; New Light Technologies, Washington, DC, USA","Center for Economic Studies, U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC, USA; New Light Technologies, Washington, DC, USA"
Investmentless Growth: An Empirical Investigation,"We analyze private fixed investment in the United States during the past 30 years. We show that investment is weak relative to measures of profitability and valuation—particularly Tobin's Q—and that this weakness starts in the early 2000s. There are two broad categories of explanations: theories that predict low investment along with a low Q, and theories that predict low investment despite a high Q. We argue that the data do not support the first category, so we focus on the second one. We use industry-level and firm-level data to test whether underinvestment relative to Q is driven by (i) financial frictions; (ii) changes in the nature or localization of investment, due to the rise of intangibles, globalization, and the like; (iii) decreased competition, due to technology, regulation, or common ownership; or (iv) tightened corporate governance or increased short-termism. We do not find support for theories based on financial frictions. We find some support for globalization and regulation; and we find strong support for the intangibles, competition, and short-termism or corporate governance hypotheses. We estimate that the rise of intangibles explains about one-third of the drop in investment, while concentration and corporate governance explain the rest. Industries with more concentration and more common ownership invest less, even after controlling for current market conditions and intangibles. Within each industry-year, the investment gap is driven by firms owned by quasi-indexers and located in industries with more concentration and common ownership. These firms return a disproportionate amount of free cash flows to shareholders. Finally, we show that slow-moving changes in competition are difficult to detect in macroeconomic series; standard growth-accounting decompositions confound market power and other medium-run trends, such as falling total factor productivity and labor participation.",Germán Gutiérrez; Thomas Philippon,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1353/eca.2017.0013,"Corporate governance, Profitability index, Investment (military), Valuation (finance), Competition (biology), Economics, Globalization, Monetary economics, Tobin's q, Cash flow, Market economy, Business, Accounting, Finance, Ecology, Politics, Political science, Law, Biology",National Bureau of Economic Research; New York University; Columbia University,"New York University Stern School of Business 44 West 4th Street, Suite 9-190 New York, NY 10012-1126; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; seminar participants at Columbia University and New York University; NYU Stern School of Business 44 West 4th Street KMC 9-190 New York, NY 10012","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; seminar participants at Columbia University and New York University; New York University Stern School of Business 44 West 4th Street, Suite 9-190 New York, NY 10012-1126; NYU Stern School of Business 44 West 4th Street KMC 9-190 New York, NY 10012"
Kaldor and Piketty’s Facts: The Rise of Monopoly Power in the United States,"The macroeconomic data of the last thirty years has overturned at least two of Kaldor's famous stylized growth facts: constant interest rates, and a constant labor share.At the same time, the research of Piketty and others has introduced several new and surprising facts: an increase in the financial wealth-to-output ratio in the US, an increase in measured Tobin's Q, and a divergence between the marginal and the average return on capital.In this paper, we argue that these trends can be explained by an increase in market power and pure profits in the US economy, i.e., the emergence of a non-zero-rent economy, along with forces that have led to a persistent long term decline in real interest rates.We make three parsimonious modifications to the standard neoclassical model to explain these trends.Using recent estimates of the increase in markups and the decrease in real interest rates, we show that our model can quantitatively match these new stylized macroeconomic facts.",Ella Getz Wold; Gauti B.

Race and Gender in Entrepreneurial Finance,"Economic frictions pervade the founding, financing, growing, and exiting of high-growth entrepreneurial firms. This article considers one friction that currently affects a small, but important, set of entrepreneurs: racial and gender discrimination. I first collect facts from a large empirical literature that show clear gender and race gaps in participation and financing of startups. Female founders manage 16-25% of all startups, while Black entrepreneurs rarely exceed 3% of the startup population. Conditioning on startups that successfully raise external finance has little impact on these gaps. The complexity of the entrepreneurial process presents several opportunities for discrimination to manifest itself and produce this gap. The article details the major discrimination theories and the empirical methods used to test for their presence. It then provides an extensive review of a growing empirical literature in entrepreneurial finance that tests these models. The pattern of evidence reveals a nuanced and incomplete story about bias, information asymmetry, and differential treatment of underrepresented founders. The article ends with an extensive set of research ideas motivated by the gaps in the entrepreneurship literature and recent developments in theory and measurement of discrimination.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",Michael Ewens,,,,,,,,,,,,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4218464,No keywords found,National Bureau of Economic Research,Columbia Business School; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER),National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Columbia Business School
Supporting small firms through recessions and recoveries,"We use variation in the access to a government credit certification program to estimate the financial and real effects of supporting small firms. This program was first implemented during the global financial crisis, but has remained active ever since, allowing us to analyze its effects both during recessions and recoveries. Eligible firms have access to government loan guarantees and a credit quality certification. We estimate real effects using a multidimensional regression discontinuity design. We find that eligible firms borrow more and at lower rates than non-eligible firms, allowing them to increase investment and employment during crises. Industry-level analysis shows reduced productivity heterogeneity in more exposed industries, which is consistent with improved credit allocation. However, when the economy is recovering the effects of the program are less pronounced and centered on the certification component. The cost-per-job in the recovery period is half of the one estimated for the crisis period (5784€ and 11,788€, respectively).",Clara C.

Why do Some Countries Produce So Much More Output Per Worker than Others?,"Output per worker varies enormously across countries. Why? On an accounting basis our analysis shows that differences in physical capital and educational attainment can only partially explain the variation in output per worker—we find a large amount of variation in the level of the Solow residual across countries. At a deeper level, we document that the differences in capital accumulation, productivity, and therefore output per worker are driven by differences in institutions and government policies, which we call social infrastructure. We treat social infrastructure as endogenous, determined historically by location and other factors captured in part by language.",C. I. Jones; R. E. Hall; Robert E.

New Varieties of State Capitalism: Strategic and Governance Implications,"We analyze the new varieties of state capitalism in the 21st century and explore their implications in terms of both strategic and governance outcomes. We begin by discussing how the current theoretical perspectives conceptualize state-owned enterprises' strategic behavior. Then we introduce a stylized distinction between four broad, new varieties of state capitalism—wholly owned state-owned enterprises, the state as a majority investor, the state as a minority investor, and the state as a strategic supporter of specific sectors—and survey each type within the different theoretical perspectives. Last, we examine firm performance for each type of state capitalism relative to private firms and contingent on country-level institutional contingencies.

Leviathan as a Minority Shareholder: Firm-Level Implications of State Equity Purchases,"In many countries, firms face institutional ""voids"" that raise the costs of doing business and thwart entrepreneurial activity. We examine a particular mechanism that may address those voids: minority state ownership. Minority stakes are less affected by the ""agency distortions"" commonly found for full-fledged state ownership. Using panel data from publicly traded firms in Brazil, where the government holds minority stakes through its development bank, we find a positive effect of those stakes on firms' returns on assets and on the capital expenditures of financially constrained firms with investment opportunities. However, these positive effects are substantially reduced when minority stakes are allocated to business group affiliates and as local institutions develop. Therefore, we shed light on the firm-level implications of minority state ownership, a topic that has received scant attention in the strategy literature.",Aldo Musacchio; Carlos F. K. V.

This must be done by 2100 if we are to keep climate change anywhere near the 2oC warming that world leaders have set as the maximum acceptable limit. Decarbonizing Development: Three Steps to a Zero–Carbon Future looks at what it would take to decarbonize the world economy by 2100 in a way that is compatible with countries' broader development goals. Here is what needs to be done: – Act early with an eye on the end-goal. To best achieve a given reduction in emissions in 2030 depends on whether this is the final target or a step towards zero net emissions. – Go beyond prices with a policy package that triggers changes in investment patterns, technologies and behaviors. Carbon pricing is necessary for an efficient transition toward decarbonization. It is an efficient way to raise revenue, which can be used to support poverty reduction or reduce other taxes. Policymakers need to adopt measures that trigger the required changes in investment patterns, behaviors, and technologies – and if carbon pricing is temporarily impossible, use these measures as a substitute. – Mind the political economy and smooth the transition for those who stand to be most affected. Reforms live or die based on the political economy. A climate policy package must be attractive to a majority of voters and avoid impacts that appear unfair or are concentrated on a region, sector or community. Reforms have to smooth the transition for those who stand to be affected, by protecting vulnerable people but also sometimes compensating powerful lobbies.""

Carbon Taxes in Theory and Practice,"As of 2020, carbon taxes were in effect in 30 jurisdictions around the world. This article provides a theoretical overview of carbon taxes along with some empirical evidence on the macroeconomic impacts of existing taxes, including emission reductions. It compares and contrasts carbon taxes with other policy instruments to reduce emissions. It also highlights issues that have recently attracted the attention of researchers on which additional research would be beneficial. Those include ( a) the role of border adjustments in a unilaterally imposed carbon tax, ( b) hybrid carbon tax systems that increase the likelihood of hitting desired emission reduction targets, ( c) the optimal price path for a carbon tax, and ( d) the growing empirical literature on the economic impact of carbon taxes.",Gilbert E.

The Masking of the Decline in Manufacturing Employment by the Housing Bubble,"The employment-to-population ratio among prime-aged adults aged 25–54 has fallen substantially since 2000. The explanations proposed for the decline in the employment-to-population ratio have been of two broad types. One set of explanations emphasizes cyclical factors associated with the recession; the second set of explanations focuses on the role of longer-run structural factors. In this paper, we argue that while the decline in manufacturing and the consequent reduction in demand for less-educated workers put downward pressure on their employment rates in the pre-recession 2000–2006 period, the increased demand for less-educated workers because of the housing boom was simultaneously pushing their employment rates upwards. For a few years, the housing boom served to “mask” the labor market effects of manufacturing decline for less-educated workers. When the housing market collapsed in 2007, there was a large, immediate decline in employment among these workers, who faced not only the sudden disappearance of jobs related to the housing boom, but also the fact that manufacturing's steady decline during the early 2000s left them with many fewer opportunities in that sector than had existed at the start of the decade.",Erik Hurst; Kerwin Kofi Charles; Matthew J.

Inspecting the Mechanism: Leverage and the Great Recession in the Eurozone,"We provide a comprehensive account of the dynamics of eurozone countries from 2000 to 2012. We analyze private leverage, fiscal policy, labor costs, and spreads, and we propose a model and an identification strategy to separate the impact of credit cycles, excessive government spending, and sudden stops. We then ask how periphery countries would have fared with different policies. We find that countries could have stabilized their employment if they had followed more conservative fiscal policies during the boom. Macroprudential policies and an early intervention by the central bank to prevent market segmentation and reduce fiscal austerity would also have significantly reduced the recession.

"House Prices, Local Demand, and Retail Prices","We document a causal response of local retail prices to changes in local house prices, with elasticities of 15–20 percent across housing cycles. These price responses are largest in zip codes with many homeowners and are driven by changes in markups rather than local costs. We argue that markups rise with house prices because greater housing wealth reduces homeowners' demand elasticity, and firms raise markups in response. Shopping data confirm that house price changes affect the price sensitivity of homeowners, but not that of renters. Our evidence suggests a new source of business cycle markup variation.",Johannes Stroebel; Joseph Vavra,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1086/701422,"House price, Economics, Price elasticity of demand, Price elasticity of supply, Monetary economics, Microeconomics, Labour economics",National Bureau of Economic Research,"New York University, National Bureau of Economic Research, and Centre for Economic Policy Research; University of Chicago and National Bureau of Economic Research","New York University, National Bureau of Economic Research, and Centre for Economic Policy Research; University of Chicago and National Bureau of Economic Research"

Finance and Business Cycles: The Credit-Driven Household Demand Channel,"What is the role of the financial sector in explaining business cycles? This question is as old as the field of macroeconomics, and an extensive body of research conducted since the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 has offered new answers. The specific idea put forward in this article is that expansions in credit supply, operating primarily through household demand, have been an important driver of business cycles.

What Happened: Financial Factors in the Great Recession,"At the onset of the recent global financial crisis, the workhorse macroeconomic models assumed frictionless financial markets. These frameworks were thus not able to anticipate the crisis, nor to analyze how the disruption of credit markets changed what initially appeared like a mild downturn into the Great Recession. Since that time, an explosion of both theoretical and empirical research has investigated how the financial crisis emerged and how it was transmitted to the real sector. The goal of this paper is to describe what we have learned from this new research and how it can be used to understand what happened during the Great Recession. In the process, we also present some new empirical work. We argue that a complete description of the Great Recession must take account of the financial distress facing both households and banks and, as the crisis unfolded, nonfinancial firms as well. Exploiting both panel data and time series methods, we analyze the contribution of the house price decline, versus the banking distress indicator, to the overall decline in employment during the Great Recession. We confirm a common finding in the literature that the household balance sheet channel is important for regional variation in employment. However, we also find that the disruption in banking was central to the overall employment contraction.",Mark Gertler; Simon Gilchrist,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.32.3.3,"Recession, Financial crisis, Economics, Great recession, Financial distress, Balance sheet, Global recession, Financial market, Monetary economics, Empirical evidence, Finance, Financial system, Macroeconomics, Keynesian economics, Philosophy, Epistemology",National Bureau of Economic Research,"Simon Gilchrist is a Professor of Economics, New York University, New York City, New York; and Research Associates, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Mark Gertler is Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Economics, New York University, New York City, New York; and Research Associates, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.","Simon Gilchrist is a Professor of Economics, New York University, New York City, New York; and Research Associates, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Mark Gertler is Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Economics, New York University, New York City, New York; and Research Associates, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts."

Identification exploits a policy framework assigning refugees to cities on a quasi-random basis and variation in nondevelopable area for the construction of an exposure measure to real estate market tightness. We estimate that the most exposed cities to real estate market tightness grew at least 1.9 percentage points more than the least exposed ones, cumulatively, from 2009 to 2014.

Unintended Consequences of Eliminating Tax Havens,"Eliminating firms' access to tax havens can have unintended consequences for their domestic economic activity.We study a policy that limited profit shifting by US multinationals and show it raised the tax cost of domestic investment.Firms affected by the policy responded by reducing investment and domestic employment.Firm-level responses were amplified to local labor markets through the establishment networks of profit-shifting firms.More exposed local labor markets experienced declines in employment, income, and home values and saw increases in government transfers.Policy proposals that limit profit shifting should therefore consider effects on economic activity in addition to tax revenue.",Juan Carlos Suárez Serrato,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w24850,"Unintended consequences, Economics, Business, Public economics, Political science, Law",World Bank; United States Department of the Treasury; Federal Reserve; University of Notre Dame; SIL International; National Bureau of Economic Research; Duke University,"Washington University (Olin), World Bank,; ITFP, NBER Public Economics and Business Tax Conferences, NTA, NY Federal Reserve, Trinity University, UC Davis, UNC, University of Copenhagen, University of Michigan, University of Notre Dame Conference on Unilateralism,; ASSA, CESifo Venice Summer Institute, Columbia, HBS,; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics Duke University 213 Social Sciences Building Box 90097 Durham, NC 27708 and; University of Zurich Conference on Public Finance in Developing Countries, US Treasury,","Washington University (Olin), World Bank,; ITFP, NBER Public Economics and Business Tax Conferences, NTA, NY Federal Reserve, Trinity University, UC Davis, UNC, University of Copenhagen, University of Michigan, University of Notre Dame Conference on Unilateralism,; ASSA, CESifo Venice Summer Institute, Columbia, HBS,; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; University of Zurich Conference on Public Finance in Developing Countries, US Treasury,; Department of Economics Duke University 213 Social Sciences Building Box 90097 Durham, NC 27708 and"
Eﬃciency or resiliency? Corporate choice between ﬁnancial and operational hedging,"We study the corporate choice between financial efficiency and operational resiliency. Firms substitute between saving cash for financial hedging, which mitigates the risk of financial default, and spending on operational hedging, which mitigates the risk of operational default such as a failure to deliver on obligations to customers.

"Corporate Debt, Boom-Bust Cycles, and Financial Crises","Using a new dataset on sectoral credit exposures covering financial and non-financial sectors in 115 economies over the period 1940-2014, we document the following evidence that corporate debt plays a key role in explaining boom-bust cycles, financial crises, and slow macroeconomic recoveries: (i) corporate debt accounts for two thirds of the aggregate credit expansion before crises and three quarters of total nonperforming loans during the bust; (ii) expansions in corporate debt predict crises similarly to household debt; (iii) a measure of imbalance in credit growth flowing disproportionately to some sectors, such as construction and non-bank financial intermediation, is associated with crises; and (iv) the recovery from financial crises is slower after a boom in corporate debt, especially when backed by procyclical collateral values, due to higher nonperforming loans.",Karsten Müller; Luc Laeven; Victoria Ivashina; Ṣebnem Kalemli-Özcan; Ṣebnem Kalemli‐Özcan,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w32225,"Bust, Boom, Debt, Financial system, Business, Finance, Economics, Monetary economics, Oceanography, Geology","Center for Economic and Policy Research; European Central Bank; National Bureau of Economic Research; National University of Singapore; University of Maryland, College Park","Department of Economics University of Maryland Tydings Hall 4118D College Park, MD 20742-7211; European Central Bank Research Department Sonnemannstrasse; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Frankfurt am Main GERMANY and CEPR; National University of Singapore 15 Kent Ridge Dr Singapore, 119245","Department of Economics University of Maryland Tydings Hall 4118D College Park, MD 20742-7211; European Central Bank Research Department Sonnemannstrasse; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Frankfurt am Main GERMANY and CEPR; National University of Singapore 15 Kent Ridge Dr Singapore, 119245"
Evaluating State and Local Business Incentives,"This essay describes and evaluates state and local business tax incentives in the United States. In 2014, states spent between $5 and $216 per capita on incentives for firms in the form of firm-specific subsidies and general tax credits, which mostly target investment, job creation, and research and development. States with higher per capita incentives tend to have higher state corporate tax rates. Recipients of firm-specific incentives are usually large establishments in manufacturing, technology, and high-skilled service industries, and the average discretionary subsidy is $178M for 1,500 promised jobs. Firms tend to accept subsidy deals from places that are richer, larger, and more urban than the average county, and poor places provide larger incentives and spend more per job. Comparing winning and runner-up locations for each deal, we find that average employment within the three-digit industry of the deal increases by roughly 1,500 jobs. While we find some evidence of direct employment gains from attracting a firm, we do not find strong evidence that firm-specific tax incentives increase broader economic growth at the state and local level.",Cailin Slattery; Owen Zidar,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.34.2.90,"Incentive, Subsidy, Tax incentive, Business, Labour economics, Per capita, Investment (military), Per capita income, Tax credit, Economics, State (computer science), Public economics, Market economy, Population, Demography, Algorithm, Sociology, Politics, Political science, Computer science, Law",National Bureau of Economic Research; Princeton University,"Cailin Slattery is Assistant Professor of Economics, Columbia Business School, New York, New York.; Owen Zidar is Associate Professor of Economics and Public Affairs, Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, and a Faculty Research Associate, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts. .","Cailin Slattery is Assistant Professor of Economics, Columbia Business School, New York, New York.; Owen Zidar is Associate Professor of Economics and Public Affairs, Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, and a Faculty Research Associate, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts. ."
Taxation and Innovation in the Twentieth Century,"Abstract This article studies the effect of corporate and personal taxes on innovation in the United States over the twentieth century. We build a panel of the universe of inventors who patented since 1920, and a historical state-level corporate tax database with corporate tax rates and tax base information, which we link to existing data on state-level personal income taxes and other economic outcomes. Our analysis focuses on the effect of personal and corporate income taxes on individual inventors (the micro level) and on states (the macro level), considering the quantity and quality of innovation, its location, and the share produced by the corporate rather than the noncorporate sector. We propose several identification strategies, all of which yield consistent results. We find that higher taxes negatively affect the quantity and the location of innovation, but not average innovation quality. The state-level elasticities to taxes are large and consistent with the aggregation of the individual-level responses of innovation produced and cross-state mobility. Corporate taxes tend to especially affect corporate inventors’ innovation production and cross-state mobility. Personal income taxes significantly affect the quantity of innovation overall and the mobility of inventors.",John Grigsby; Stefanie Stantcheva; Tom Nicholas; Ufuk Akcigit,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjab022,"Personal income, Affect (linguistics), Quality (philosophy), State (computer science), Corporate tax, Business, Yield (engineering), Production (economics), Economics, Public economics, Monetary economics, Labour economics, Tax reform, Economic growth, Microeconomics, Tax avoidance, Linguistics, Philosophy, Materials science, Epistemology, Algorithm, Computer science, Metallurgy",National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University; Northwestern University; Centre for Economic Policy Research,"Centre for Economic Policy Research, United Kingdom; University of Chicago and National Bureau of Economic Research, United States, and Centre for Economic Policy Research, United Kingdom; Northwestern University, United States; Harvard Business School, United States; Harvard University and National Bureau of Economic Research, United States","Centre for Economic Policy Research, United Kingdom; University of Chicago and National Bureau of Economic Research, United States, and Centre for Economic Policy Research, United Kingdom; Northwestern University, United States; Harvard Business School, United States; Harvard University and National Bureau of Economic Research, United States"
Tax Policy and Investment in a Global Economy,"We evaluate the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Combining reduced-form estimates from tax data with a global investment model, we estimate responses, identify parameters, and conduct counterfactuals.Domestic investment of firms with the mean tax change increases 20% versus a no-change baseline.Due to novel foreign incentives, foreign capital of U.S. multinationals rises substantially.These incentives also boost domestic investment, indicating complementarity between domestic and foreign capital.In the model, the long-run effect on domestic capital in general equilibrium is 7% and the tax revenue feedback from growth offsets only 2p.p. of the direct cost of 41% of pre-TCJA corporate revenue.",Eric Zwick; Gabriel Chodorow-Reich; Matthew Smith; Owen Zidar,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w32180,"Economics, Investment (military), Tax policy, Market economy, Monetary economics, Tax reform, Political science, Politics, Law",University of Chicago; Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research; United States Department of the Treasury,"Department of Economics &; School of International and Public Affairs Princeton University 237 Julis Romo Rabinowitz Building Princeton, NJ 08544 and; U.S. Department of the Treasury 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, D.C. 20220; Littauer Center Cambridge, MA 02138 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; School of Business University of Chicago 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue Chicago, IL 60637 and; Department of Economics Harvard University 1805","Department of Economics &; School of International and Public Affairs Princeton University 237 Julis Romo Rabinowitz Building Princeton, NJ 08544 and; U.S. Department of the Treasury 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, D.C. 20220; Littauer Center Cambridge, MA 02138 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; School of Business University of Chicago 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue Chicago, IL 60637 and; Department of Economics Harvard University 1805"
How to Use Natural Experiments to Estimate Misallocation,"We propose a method to estimate the effect of firm policies (e.g., bankruptcy laws) on allocative efficiency using (quasi-)experimental evidence. Our approach takes general equilibrium effects into account and requires neither a structural estimation nor a precise assumption on how the experiment affects firms. Our aggregation formula relies on treatment effects of the policy on the distribution of output-to-capital ratios, which are easily estimated. We show this method is valid for a large class of commonly used models in macrofinance. We apply it to the French banking deregulation episode of the mid- 1980s and find an increase in aggregate TFP of 5 percent.

Social Mendelism,"Who was the scientific progenitor of eugenic thought? Amir Teicher challenges the preoccupation with Darwin's eugenic legacy by uncovering the extent to which Gregor Mendel's theory of heredity became crucial in the formation - and radicalization - of eugenic ideas. Through a compelling analysis of the entrenchment of genetic thinking in the social and political policies in Germany between 1900 and 1948, Teicher exposes how Mendelian heredity became saturated with cultural meaning, fed racial anxieties, reshaped the ideal of the purification of the German national body and ultimately defined eugenic programs. Drawing on scientific manuscripts and memoirs, bureaucratic correspondence, court records, school notebooks and Hitler's table talk as well as popular plays and films, Social Mendelism presents a new paradigm for understanding links between genetics and racism, and between biological and social thought.",Amir Teicher,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108583190,"Eugenics, Bureaucracy, Politics, Heredity, Sociology, German, Darwinism, Meaning (existential), Social Darwinism, Epistemology, Law, Philosophy, Political science, Biology, Genetics, Linguistics",Tel Aviv University,Tel-Aviv University,Tel-Aviv University
Overshadowed voices in media reporting on truth-telling commissions,"Over the past decades, truth-telling commissions aimed at uncovering, confronting and providing justice for the past treatment of children have been established in many countries, including the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse (RCIRCSA 2013-2017) and the Norwegian Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) (2018-2023). Journalism plays important roles both in triggering commissions of inquiry and in attracting public attention to their work and findings. This paper investigates media reporting on the RCIRCSA and the TRC. The Commissions were not similar in scale, scope or legal powers, however, they both generated spaces for public listening to stories about the consequences of past policies and present practices of child removal, abuse and racism that potentially could change the grand narratives of each nation. Our findings suggest that future commissions should pay particular attention to the structural power of news logics and mediation. We find, despite the widely different cases, consistent patterns of uneven and hierarchical media reporting and overshadowing of First Nations voices and aspirations.",Eli Skogerbø; Kerry McCallum; Tanja Dreher,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.1177/01634437241276125,"Truth telling, Political science, Sociology, Media studies, Psychology, Psychoanalysis",University of Canberra; UNSW Sydney; University of Oslo,"University of Oslo, Norway; University of Canberra, Australia; University of New South Wales, Australia","University of Oslo, Norway; University of Canberra, Australia; University of New South Wales, Australia"
Climate risks and FDI,"Climate-related risks have increased in recent decades, both in terms of the frequency of extreme weather events (physical risk) and the implementation of climate-change mitigation policies (transition risk). This paper explores whether multinational firms react to such risks by altering their presence in countries that are more affected. We measure this by examining foreign direct investment (FDI) dynamics at different levels of aggregation as well as at the firm level. We propose a theoretical framework for firm production location choice that explicitly incorporates transition and physical risks. The model predicts a reduction in FDI resulting from both physical and transition risks but an ambiguous interaction effect of these risks with emission productivity. In an extensive empirical analysis, we find some support for model predictions, but overall we do not find consistent evidence for statistically significant effects of physical and transition risks on FDI. However, firm-level evidence suggests that firms that are more exposed to climate risks react more negatively to physical climate risk following Paris Climate Accord. We also find that FDI outflows following extreme weather events from affected countries are smaller for industries with higher emission productivity (greener industries). Our theory and empirical results point to the importance of accounting for heterogeneity in emission productivity when analyzing the effects of climate risks.",Galina Hale; Grace Weishi Gu,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinteco.2023.103731,"Multinational corporation, Productivity, Foreign direct investment, Climate change, Economics, Natural resource economics, Risk management, Investment (military), Empirical research, Empirical evidence, Climate change mitigation, Macroeconomics, Finance, Politics, Ecology, Philosophy, Epistemology, Political science, Law, Biology","University of California, Santa Cruz; Center for Economic and Policy Research","University of California Santa Cruz, United States of America; University of California Santa Cruz, NBER, CEPR, United States of America","University of California Santa Cruz, United States of America; University of California Santa Cruz, NBER, CEPR, United States of America"
Representative Bureaucracy and Government Contracting: A Further Examination of Evidence from Federal Agencies,"The theory of representative bureaucracy holds that demographic characteristics of public managers influence policy design and implementation, but only a few studies have been conducted on the impact of representative bureaucracy on contract decisions. This paper contributes to that work by examining the relationship between minority representation in federal agencies and the awarding of agency contracts to minority-owned businesses. Using federal-level employment and contracting data, we determine that variables measuring minority representation overall, the presence of college-educated minorities, and minorities in certain positions related to contract decision-making are all positively correlated with increased numbers of contracts going to minority-owned firms. Our findings build on earlier work and provide additional support for the importance of the theory of representative bureaucracy in a governance system where contracting is common.",Benjamin M Brunjes; Benjamin M.

Estimating Determinants of Transportation and Warehousing Establishment Locations Using U.S. Administrative Data,"Interactions between transportation and warehousing and other industry clusters are not widely explored and the determinants of logistics locational determinants is limited in the U.S. context. These gaps in the literature, along with the U.S. transportation and warehousing sector's decentralization from urban areas and concentration in regions, highlight the importance of understanding the effects of place-based factors and inter-industry clusters on the locations and employment of transportation and warehousing industries. The analysis uses restricted-access U.S. Census Bureau data aggregated to the county level, along with secondary data sources, to estimate the locational determinants of transportation and warehousing (TW) industries based on transportation infrastructure as well as sociodemographic and institutional variables. The analysis takes a cross-sectional (non-causal) approach to focus on time-invariant location factors while testing and implementing zero-inflated count data distributions to model the data generation processes more accurately. Results indicate that subsectors are affected differently by infrastructure, sociodemographic, and institutional variables. Additionally, different factors are associated with industry presence versus size. Finally, we show that data using aggregated industries obscures locational factors' importance for individual sub-sectors and, further, that industrial aggregation obscures TW sectors' relationships to other clusters.",Anders Van Sandt; Craig Carpenter; Craig Wesley Carpenter; Rebekka Dudensing; Rebekka M.

"Microcredit Under the Microscope: What Have We Learned in the Past Two Decades, and What Do We Need to Know?","Research on microcredit is now two decades old. There has been enormous progress in understanding both what microcredit does and how. Yet a lot of what we have learned has raised new and often quite fundamental questions about its nature: Is microcredit primarily about investment, consumption, or savings? Why is it that the investments financed by microcredit do not always lead to income growth, and does this have to do with the structure of microlending? What are the roles of social capital, reputation, and group lending?

The Effects of Gentrification on the Well-Being and Opportunity of Original Resident Adults and Children,"We use new longitudinal census microdata to provide the first causal evidence of how gentrification affects a broad set of outcomes for original resident adults and children.Gentrification modestly increases out-migration, though movers are not made observably worse off and neighborhood change is driven primarily by changes to in-migration.At the same time, many original resident adults stay and benefit from declining poverty exposure and rising house values.Children benefit from increased exposure to higher-opportunity neighborhoods, and some are more likely to attend and complete college.Our results suggest that accommodative policies, such as increasing the supply of housing in high-demand urban areas, could increase the opportunity benefits we find, reduce out-migration pressure, and promote long-term affordability.",Davin Reed; Quentin Brummet,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.21799/frbp.wp.2019.30,"Gentrification, Demographic economics, Sociology, Demography, Geography, Psychology, Economic growth, Economics",University of Chicago; Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia; National Opinion Research Center,"Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Community Development and Regional Outreach Department.; NORC at the University of Chicago","Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Community Development and Regional Outreach Department.; NORC at the University of Chicago"

"Agency, Information and Corporate Investment","This essay surveys the body of research that asks how the efficiency of corporate investment is influenced by problems of asymmetric information and agency. I organize the material around two basic questions. First, does the external capital market channel the right amount of money to each firm? That is, does the market get across-firm allocations right, so that the marginal return to investment in firm i is the same as the marginal return to investment in firm j? Second, do internal capital markets channel the right amount of money to individual projects within firms? That is, does the internal capital budgeting process get within-firm allocations right, so that the marginal return to investment in firm i’s division A is the same as the marginal return to investment in firm i’s division B? In addition to discussing the theoretical and empirical work that bears most directly on these questions, the essay also briefly sketches some of the implications of this work for broader issues in both macroeconomics and the theory of the firm.",Jeremy C.

The study uses archival data collected from the Government of Chile to compile and categorize public expenditures and programs supporting the Chilean wine industry over the period of 1990–2012 into investment in different types of knowledge capital. These spending categories are related to industry-level sales growth. The paper finds that the most important correlate is spending on research and development. The study also uses data from a new survey of Chilean wine firms to capture information on firm-specific investments in knowledge capital. The findings show that investments in collaboration capital, in particular hiring foreign consultants, as well as participation in international wine fairs are the strongest correlates of growth in export sales, while spending on aspects of branding (local advertising and brand design) are the strongest correlates of domestic market sales growth.

Uncertainty-Induced Reallocations and the Macroeconomy,"Focusing on both micro and aggregate U.S. data, we document the existence of a significant link between aggregate uncertainty, capital markets valuations and reallocation of resources away from risky R&D-intensive capital. This link is important because a decrease in the aggregate share of R&D-oriented investments forecasts lower medium-term growth. We study a two-sector model in which one sector features relatively risky R&D-intensive capital essential to sustain growth, whereas the other sector features safer capital that is not innovation-intensive. Our model accounts for our novel empirical evidence obtained from both capital markets and aggregate data. We identify an important role for uncertainty shocks as they feature a first-order negative impact on medium-term growth and welfare.",Mariano (Max) Massimiliano Croce; Mariano Massimiliano Croce; Ravi Bansal; Samuel Rosen; Wenxi Liao,,,,,,,,,,,,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2872105,"Economics, Aggregate (composite), SAFER, Capital (architecture), Capital intensity, Monetary economics, Welfare, Order (exchange), Econometrics, Microeconomics, Finance, Market economy, Profit (economics), Materials science, Computer security, Archaeology, Computer science, Composite material, History",Bocconi University; Temple University; Centre for Economic Policy Research; Duke University,"Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR); Finance Department, Bocconi University; Fuqua School of Business, Duke University; Duke University and NBER; Temple University, Fox School of Business","Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR); Finance Department, Bocconi University; Fuqua School of Business, Duke University; Duke University and NBER; Temple University, Fox School of Business"
Global Supply Chains and Trade Policy,"How do global supply chain linkages modify countries' incentives to impose import protection?Are these linkages empirically important determinants of trade policy?To address these questions, we introduce supply chain linkages into a workhorse terms-of-trade model of trade policy with political economy.Theory predicts that discretionary final goods tariffs will be decreasing in the domestic content of foreign-produced final goods.Provided foreign political interests are not too strong, final goods tariffs will also be decreasing in the foreign content of domestically-produced final goods.We test these predictions using newly assembled data on bilateral applied tariffs, temporary trade barriers, and value-added contents for 14 major economies over the 1995-2009 period.We find strong support for the empirical predictions of the model.Our results imply that global supply chains matter for trade policy, both in principle and in practice.",Chad Bown; Chad P.

How Acquisitions Affect Firm Behavior and Performance: Evidence from the Dialysis Industry*,"Abstract Many industries have become increasingly concentrated through mergers and acquisitions, which in health care may have important consequences for spending and outcomes. Using a rich panel of Medicare claims data for nearly one million dialysis patients, we advance the literature on the effects of mergers and acquisitions by studying the precise ways providers change their behavior following an acquisition. We base our empirical analysis on more than 1,200 acquisitions of independent dialysis facilities by large chains over a 12-year period and find that chains transfer several prominent strategies to the facilities they acquire. Most notably, acquired facilities converge to the behavior of their new parent companies by increasing patients’ doses of highly reimbursed drugs, replacing high-skill nurses with less-skilled technicians, and waitlisting fewer patients for kidney transplants. We then show that patients fare worse as a result of these changes: outcomes such as hospitalizations and mortality deteriorate, with our long panel allowing us to identify these effects from within-facility or within-patient variation around the acquisitions. Because overall Medicare spending increases at acquired facilities, mostly as a result of higher drug reimbursements, this decline in quality corresponds to a decline in value for payers. We conclude the article by considering the channels through which acquisitions produce such large changes in provider behavior and outcomes, finding that increased market power cannot explain the decline in quality. Rather, the adoption of the acquiring firm’s strategies and practices drives our main results, with greater economies of scale for drug purchasing responsible for more than half of the change in profits following an acquisition.",Benjamin Heebsh; James W Roberts; James W.

The Political Economy of the Decline of Antitrust Enforcement in the United States,"Antitrust enforcement in the United States has declined since the 1960s. Building on several new datasets, we argue that this decline did not reflect a popular demand for weaker enforcement or any other kind of democratic sanction. The decline was engineered by unelected regulators and judges who, with a few exceptions, did not express skepticism about antitrust law in confirmation hearings. We find little evidence that academic ideas played an important role in the decline of antitrust enforcement except where they coincided with the interests of big business, which appears to have exercised influence behind the scenes.",Eric A.

The Making of the Modern Metropolis: Evidence from London*,"Abstract Using newly constructed spatially disaggregated data for London from 1801 to 1921, we show that the invention of the steam railway led to the first large-scale separation of workplace and residence. We show that a class of quantitative urban models is remarkably successful in explaining this reorganization of economic activity. We structurally estimate one of the models in this class and find substantial agglomeration forces in both production and residence. In counterfactuals, we find that removing the whole railway network reduces the population and the value of land and buildings in London by up to 51.5% and 53.3% respectively, and decreases net commuting into the historical center of London by more than 300,000 workers.",Daniel M Sturm; Daniel Sturm; Stephan Heblich; Stephen J Redding; Stephen J.

Exchange Rates and Monetary Policy with Heterogeneous Agents: Sizing up the Real Income Channel,"Introducing heterogeneous households to a New Keynesian small open economy model amplifies the real income channel of exchange rates: the rise in import prices from a depreciation lowers households' real incomes, and leads them to cut back on spending.When the sum of import and export elasticities is one, this channel is offset by a larger Keynesian multiplier, heterogeneity is irrelevant, and expenditure switching drives the output response.With plausibly lower short-term elasticities, however, the real income channel dominates, and depreciation can be contractionary for output.This weakens monetary transmission and creates a dilemma for policymakers facing capital outflows.Delayed import price pass-through weakens the real income channel, while heterogeneous consumption baskets can strengthen it.",Adrien Auclert; Ludwig Straub; Martin Souchier; Matthew Rognlie,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w28872,"Economics, Monetary policy, Sizing, Monetary economics, Channel (broadcasting), Computer science, Telecommunications, Chemistry, Organic chemistry",Harvard University Press; Universidad Argentina John F.

Unequal Expenditure Switching: Evidence from Switzerland,"What are the unequal effects of changes in consumer prices on the cost of living?In the context of changes in import prices (driven by, e.g., changes in trade costs or exchange rates), most analyses focus on variation across households in initial expenditure shares on imported goods.However, the unequal welfare effects of non-marginal foreign price changes also depend on differences in how consumers substitute between imported and domestic goods, on which there is scant evidence.Using data from Switzerland surrounding the 2015 appreciation of the Swiss franc, we provide evidence that lower-income households have higher price elasticities.We quantify the contribution of heterogeneous elasticities for the unequal welfare effects of observed price changes between 2014-15 and for counterfactual shocks to the mean and dispersion of import price changes.",Ariel Burstein; Jonathan Vogel; Raphael Auer; Sarah Lein; Sarah M.

"Discrete Choice, Complete Markets, and Equilibrium","This paper characterizes the allocations that emerge in general equilibrium economies populated by households with preferences of the additive random utility type that make discrete consumption, employment or spatial decisions.We start with a complete markets economy where households can trade claims contingent upon the realizations of their preference shocks.We (i) establish a first and second welfare theorem, (ii) illustrate that in the absence of ex-ante trade, discrete choice economies are generically inefficient, (iii) show that complete markets are not necessary and a much smaller set of securities decentralizes the efficient allocation.We illustrate the relevance of these results in several canonical settings and for measuring how welfare changes in response to changes in prices.",Michael Waugh; Simon Mongey,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w32135,"Economics, Mathematical economics, Computer science",National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis,"NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis 90 Hennepin Ave Minneapolis, MN 55401 and","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis 90 Hennepin Ave Minneapolis, MN 55401 and"
The Value of De Minimis Imports,"Section 321 of the 1930 Trade Act allows up to $800 in imports per person per day to enter the US duty-free and with minimal customs requirements.Fueled by rising direct-to-consumer trade, these ""de minimis"" shipments have exploded yet are not recorded in Census trade data.Who benefits from this type of trade, and what are the policy implications?We analyze international shipment data, including de minimis shipments, from three global carriers and US Customs and Border Protection.Lower-income zip codes are more likely to import de minimis shipments, particularly from China, suggesting that the tariff and administrative fee incidence in direct-toconsumer trade is pro-poor.Theoretically, imposing tariffs above a threshold leads to terms-oftrade gains through bunching, even in a setting with complete pass-through to linear tariffs.Empirically, bunching pins down the demand elasticity for direct shipments.Eliminating §321 would reduce aggregate welfare by $11.8-$14.3 billion and disproportionately hurt lower-income and minority consumers.",Amit Khandelwal; Pablo Fajgelbaum,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w32607,"Value (mathematics), Environmental science, Economics, Business, Mathematics, Statistics","National Bureau of Economic Research; Yale University; University of California, Los Angeles","Yale University Economics Department, Jackson School 55 Hillhouse Avenue New Haven, CT 06511 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of California, Los Angeles 8283 Bunche Hall Mail Stop: 147703 Los Angeles, CA 90095","Yale University Economics Department, Jackson School 55 Hillhouse Avenue New Haven, CT 06511 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of California, Los Angeles 8283 Bunche Hall Mail Stop: 147703 Los Angeles, CA 90095"
The Micro and Macro Dynamics of Capital Flows,"We study empirically and theoretically the effects of international capital flows on resource allocation.Using the universe of firms in Hungary, we show that financial openness triggers input-cost and consumption channels, with the latter dominant and reallocating resources toward high expenditure elasticity activities in the short-run.A multi-sector heterogeneous firm trade model replicates these dynamics.In the long-run, the model predicts that resources will shift towards manufacturing exports to service debt.Owing to endogenous terms of trade dynamics, countries face a trade-off between the speed of convergence and their long-run capital stock; thus, financial openness can lead to welfare losses.",Felipe Saffie; Kei-Mu Yi; Kei‐Mu Yi; Liliana Varela,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w27371,"Macro, Dynamics (music), Capital (architecture), Economics, Economic geography, Computer science, Mechanics, Physics, Geography, Acoustics, Archaeology, Programming language","University of Houston; University of Virginia; University of California, Berkeley; Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile; London School of Economics and Political Science; Bocconi University; University of Chile; Princeton University; Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas; International Monetary Fund; Banque de France","University of Notre Dame, Micro and Macro in International Finance of Bank of England-Banque de France, VMACS Junior, Virtual International Trade and Macro Seminar, Chicago; Department of Finance London School of Economics London, WC2A 2AE United Kingdom; Universidad de Chile, and Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile; Darden Business School University of Virginia; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; conference participants of U.C.

The Aggregate Productivity Effects of Internal Migration: Evidence from Indonesia,"We estimate the aggregate productivity gains from reducing barriers to internal labor migration in Indonesia, accounting for worker selection and spatial differences in human capital. We distinguish between movement costs, which mean workers will move only if they expect higher wages, and amenity differences, which mean some locations must pay more to attract workers. We find modest but important aggregate impacts. We estimate a 22 percent increase in labor productivity from removing all barriers. Reducing migration costs to the US level, a high-mobility benchmark, leads to a 7.1 percent productivity boost. These figures hide substantial heterogeneity. The origin population that benefits most sees a 104 percent increase in average earnings from a complete barrier removal, or a 25 percent gain from moving to the US benchmark.",Gharad Bryan; Melanie Morten,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1086/701810,"Productivity, Amenity, Earnings, Economics, Labour economics, Internal migration, Human capital, Benchmark (surveying), Population, Demographic economics, Aggregate (composite), Econometrics, Developing country, Geography, Macroeconomics, Economic growth, Finance, Materials science, Composite material, Demography, Geodesy, Sociology",National Bureau of Economic Research; Stanford University; London School of Economics and Political Science,Stanford University and National Bureau of Economic Research; London School of Economics,Stanford University and National Bureau of Economic Research; London School of Economics

Household Income as a Determinant of Racial Residential Segregation in Metropolitan Areas: A Micro-level Analysis from 2000 to 2020,"In this study, I examine the role of household income in determining White-Black, White-Latino, and White-Asian residential segregation in the twenty-first century across 50 metropolitan areas over the decennial time points from 2000 to 2020. I use census and survey microdata and a reformulation of the separation index, a measure of the segregation dimension of evenness, to situate segregation as a group inequality that can be analyzed using group-specific household-level regression models and regression standardization analysis, where household income is the predictor of segregation-relevant neighborhood outcomes. I find that across groups, across communities, and over time, the role of household income in shaping segregation patterns varies widely. White-Black segregation is lowest between high-income households and is declining consistently for all income groups, even at mismatched incomes. White-Latino segregation patterns are more inconsistent, with segregation staying low and stable for high-income Latino households but rising somewhat for low- and middle-income households. Finally, White-Asian segregation is rising and has risen the fastest for high-income Asian households. These findings call for continuing investigation into the shifting and interlocking dynamics of race and income that shape segregation outcomes.",Amber R.

Does nothing stop a bullet like a job? The effects of income on crime,"Do jobs and income-transfer programs affect crime?The answer depends on why one is asking the question, which shapes what one means by ""crime.""Many studies focus on understanding why overall crime rates vary across people, places, and time; since 80% of all crimes are property offenses, that's what this type of research typically explains.But if the goal is to understand what to do about the crime problem, the focus will instead be on serious violent crimes, which account for the majority of the social costs of crime.The best available evidence suggests that policies that reduce economic desperation reduce property crime (and hence overall crime rates) but have little systematic relationship to violent crime.The difference in impacts surely stems in large part from the fact that most violent crimes, including murder, are not crimes of profit but rather crimes of passion -including rage.Policies to alleviate material hardship, as important and useful as those are for improving people's lives and well-being, are not by themselves sufficient to also substantially alleviate the burden of crime on society.",Jens Ludwig; Kevin Schnepel,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w32297,"Nothing, Silver bullet, Computer security, Criminology, Business, Psychology, Computer science, Sociology, Philosophy, Epistemology, Anthropology",National Bureau of Economic Research; Simon Fraser University; University of Chicago,"Department of Economics 8888 University Drive Simon Fraser University Burnaby, British Columbia, V5A 1S6 Canada; Harris School of Public Policy University of Chicago 1307 East 60th Street Chicago, IL 60637 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138","Department of Economics 8888 University Drive Simon Fraser University Burnaby, British Columbia, V5A 1S6 Canada; Harris School of Public Policy University of Chicago 1307 East 60th Street Chicago, IL 60637 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138"
Foreshadowing the Civil Rights Counter-Revolution,"Abstract After overseeing the adoption of two landmark civil rights proposals in 1964 and 1965, the Johnson administration and its allies in Congress sought to implement the third item of its broader agenda: a legal prohibition on racial discrimination in the sale and rental of housing. Enacting fair housing legislation, however, proved to be a vexing process. Advocates had to win support from northern White Democrats skeptical of the policy, as well as Republicans who were often (and increasingly) unreliable allies. Fair housing legislation failed in 1966 (89th Congress) but passed two years later, during the 90th Congress. We provide a legislative policy history detailing how, after three tumultuous years, Congress came to enact the fair housing provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. Overall, the battle to enact fair housing legislation presaged a dynamic that would take hold as the Great Society gave way to the Nixon years: once federal civil rights policies started to bear directly on the lives of White northerners, they became much harder to pass and implement. It also showcased the moment at which the Republican Party in Congress first moved to the right on civil rights and explicitly adopted a position of racial conservatism.",Jeffery A.

The Cash Flow Sensitivity of Cash,"ABSTRACT We model a firm's demand for liquidity to develop a new test of the effect of financial constraints on corporate policies. The effect of financial constraints is captured by the firm's propensity to save cash out of cash flows (the cash flow sensitivity of cash ). We hypothesize that constrained firms should have a positive cash flow sensitivity of cash, while unconstrained firms' cash savings should not be systematically related to cash flows. We empirically estimate the cash flow sensitivity of cash using a large sample of manufacturing firms over the 1971 to 2000 period and find robust support for our theory.",Heitor Almeida; Michael S.

The Long-Run Impacts of Public Industrial Investment on Local Development and Economic Mobility: Evidence from World War II,"This paper studies the long-run effects of government-led construction of manufacturing plants on the regions where they were built and on individuals from those regions.Specifically, we examine publicly financed plants built in dispersed locations outside of major urban centers for security reasons during the United States' industrial mobilization for World War II.Wartime plant construction had large and persistent impacts on local development, characterized by an expansion of relatively high-wage manufacturing employment throughout the postwar era.These benefits were shared by incumbent residents; we find men born before WWII in counties where plants were built earned $1,200 (in 2020 dollars) or 2.5 percent more per year in adulthood relative to those born in counterfactual comparison regions, with larger benefits accruing to children of lower-income parents.The balance of evidence suggests that these individuals benefited primarily from the local expansion of higher-wage jobs to which they had access as adults, rather than because of developmental effects from exposure to better environments during childhood.",Andrew Garin; Jonathan Rothbaum,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w32265,"Investment (military), Public investment, World War II, Economics, First world war, Economic geography, Natural resource economics, Macroeconomics, Political science, History, Fiscal policy, Ancient history, Politics, Law",National Bureau of Economic Research; Carnegie Mellon University; Abcam (United States); United States Census Bureau,"Heinz College Carnegie Mellon University 5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; University de Montreal, UVA, MIT, NIU, UBC, Iowa, BEA, Pitt, ITAM, Colmex, the Bank; Social, Economic, and Housing Statistics US Census Bureau 4600 Silver Hill Road Washington, DC 20233","Heinz College Carnegie Mellon University 5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; University de Montreal, UVA, MIT, NIU, UBC, Iowa, BEA, Pitt, ITAM, Colmex, the Bank; Social, Economic, and Housing Statistics US Census Bureau 4600 Silver Hill Road Washington, DC 20233"
Impact of in utero airborne lead exposure on long-run adult socio-economic outcomes: A population analysis using U.S. survey and administrative data,"As a neurotoxin, early exposure to lead has long been assumed to affect socioeconomic outcomes well into adulthood. However, the empirical literature documenting such effects has been limited. This study documents the long-term effects of in utero exposure to air lead on adult socio-economic outcomes, including real earnings, disabilities, employment, public assistance, and education, using US survey and administrative data. Specifically, we match individuals in the 2000 US Decennial Census and 2001–2014 American Community Surveys to average lead concentrations in the individual’s birth county during his/her 9 months in utero . We then estimate the effects of shocks to airborne lead conditional on observable characteristics, county fixed effects, county-specific time trends, and month-year fixed effects. We find a 0.5 μg/m 3 decrease in air lead, representing the average 1975–85 change resulting from the passage of the U.S. Clean Air Act, is associated with an increase in earnings of 3.5%, or a present value, at birth, of $21,400 in lifetime earnings. Decomposing this effect, we find greater exposure to lead in utero is associated with an increase in disabilities in adulthood, an increase in receiving public assistance, and a decrease in employment. Looking at effects by sex, long-term effects for girls seem to fall on participation in the formal labor market, whereas for boys it appears to fall more on hours worked. This is the first study to document such long-term effects from lead using US data. We estimate the present value in 2020, from all earnings impacts from 1975 forward, to be $4.23 Trillion using a discount rate of 3%. In 2020 alone, the benefits are $252 B, or about 1.2% of GDP. Thus, our estimates imply the Clean Air Act’s lead phase out is still returning a national dividend of over 1% every year.",H.

Formative Experiences and the Price of Gasoline,"Formative experiences shape behavior for decades. We document a striking feature about those who came of driving age during the oil crises of the 1970s—they drive less in the year 2000. The effect is not specific to these cohorts; price variation over time and across states indicates that gasoline price changes between ages 15–18 generally shift later-life travel behavior. Effects are not explained by recessions, income, or costly skill acquisition and are inconsistent with recency bias, mental plasticity, and standard habit-formation models. Instead, they likely reflect formation of preferences for driving or persistent changes in its perceived cost. (JEL D12, D91, L71, Q35, R41)",Arthur A.

Helping Children Catch Up: Early Life Shocks and the PROGRESA Experiment,"Can investing in children who faced adverse events in early childhood help them catch up?We answer this question using two orthogonal sources of variation -resource availability at birth (local rainfall) and cash incentives for school enrollment -to identify the interaction between early endowments and investments in children.We find that adverse rainfall in the year of birth decreases grade attainment, post-secondary enrollment, and employment outcomes.But children whose families were randomized to receive conditional cash transfers experienced a much smaller decline: each additional year of program exposure during childhood mitigated more than 20 percent of early disadvantage.",Achyuta Adhvaryu; Anant Nyshadham; Jorge Tamayo; Teresa Molina,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w24848,"Disadvantage, Incentive, Cash transfers, Early childhood, Demographic economics, Conditional cash transfer, Cash, Randomized experiment, Economics, Resource (disambiguation), Demography, Psychology, Medicine, Developmental psychology, Political science, Economic growth, Finance, Poverty, Sociology, Computer network, Pathology, Computer science, Law, Microeconomics","Ross School; Boston College; University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa; University of Michigan–Ann Arbor; California State University, Long Beach; National Bureau of Economic Research; Hitotsubashi University","Harvard Business School Soldiers Field, Morgan Hall 292 Boston, MA 02163; NBER, Michigan, USC, PAA, PacDev,; participants at Hitotsubashi University, the SRCD Biennial Meeting, AEA Annual Meeting, PHS Research Workshop, Barcelona GSE Summer Forum,; University of Hawaii at Manoa Saunders Hall 515A 2424 Maile Way Honolulu, HI 96822; Cal State Long Beach, NEUDC,; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Ross School of Business University of Michigan 701 Tappan Street Ann Arbor, MI 48109 and; Department of Economics Boston College Maloney Hall, 324 Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 and","Harvard Business School Soldiers Field, Morgan Hall 292 Boston, MA 02163; NBER, Michigan, USC, PAA, PacDev,; participants at Hitotsubashi University, the SRCD Biennial Meeting, AEA Annual Meeting, PHS Research Workshop, Barcelona GSE Summer Forum,; University of Hawaii at Manoa Saunders Hall 515A 2424 Maile Way Honolulu, HI 96822; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Cal State Long Beach, NEUDC,; Ross School of Business University of Michigan 701 Tappan Street Ann Arbor, MI 48109 and; Department of Economics Boston College Maloney Hall, 324 Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 and"

The Impact of Youth Medicaid Eligibility on Adult Incarceration,"This paper identifies an important spillover associated with public health insurance: reduced incarceration. In 1990, Congress passed legislation that increased Medicaid eligibility for individuals born after September 30, 1983. We show that Black children born just after the cutoff are 5 percent less likely to be incarcerated by age 28, driven primarily by a decrease in incarcerations connected to financially motivated offenses. Children of other races, who experienced almost no gain in Medicaid coverage as a result of the policy, demonstrate no such decline. We find that reduced incarceration in adulthood substantially offsets the initial costs of expanding eligibility.

The Costs of Employment Segregation: Evidence from the Federal Government Under Woodrow Wilson,"Abstract We link newly digitized personnel records of the U.S. government for 1907–1921 to census data to study the segregation of the civil service by race under President Woodrow Wilson. Using a difference-in-differences design around Wilson’s inauguration, we find that the introduction of employment segregation increased the black-white earnings gap by 3.4–6.9 percentage points. This increasing gap is driven by a reallocation of existing black civil servants to lower-paid positions, lowering their returns to education. Importantly, the negative effects extend beyond Wilson’s presidency. Using census data for 1900–1940, we show that segregation caused a relative decline in the home ownership rate of black civil servants. Moreover, by comparing children of black and white civil servants in adulthood, we provide suggestive evidence that descendants of black civil servants who were exposed to Wilson’s presidency exhibit lower levels of education, earnings, and social mobility. Our combined results thus document significant short- and long-run costs borne by minorities during a unique episode of state-sanctioned discrimination.",Abhay Aneja; Guo Xu,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjab040,"Presidency, Census, Earnings, Civil servants, White (mutation), Government (linguistics), Civil service, Civil rights, Demographic economics, Race (biology), Labour economics, Military service, Economics, Political science, Public administration, Sociology, Law, Politics, Public service, Demography, Finance, Gender studies, Population, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Linguistics, Philosophy, Gene","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Berkeley","University of California, Berkeley, United States; University of California, Berkeley, and National Bureau of Economic Research, United States","University of California, Berkeley, United States; University of California, Berkeley, and National Bureau of Economic Research, United States"
Reparations as Development? Evidence from Victims of the Colombian Armed Conflict,"Our study is the first to investigate the effects of reparations for victims of gross human rights violations. In Colombia, victims of forced displacement, homicide, and other atrocities during the conflict received a lump-sum payment equal to three times their annual household income. Using novel linked administrative microdata and event studies, we show that reparations help victims rebuild their lives and significantly improve their well-being and that of their children. Specifically, reparations promote investment in physical and human capital, leading to enhanced living and health conditions, better educational outcomes, and increased asset-building and entrepreneurship, despite slightly discouraging labor supply.",Arlen Guarin; Arlen Guarín; Christian Posso; Juliana Londoño-Vélez,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.32468/be.1236,"Microdata (statistics), Human capital, Human trafficking, Homicide, Forced migration, Payment, Asset (computer security), Investment (military), Armed conflict, Political science, Demographic economics, Economics, Criminology, Business, Economic growth, Refugee, Sociology, Finance, Law, Poison control, Suicide prevention, Medicine, Population, Demography, Environmental health, Computer security, Politics, Computer science, Census",World Bank; Banco de la República Colombia,"Department of National Planning, Confecámaras, MinSalud, Catas-tro Antioquia,; the World Bank's Development Impact Evaluation (DIME) department, 1818 H St. NW, MC 4-404 Washington, DC 20433; sor of Economics at UCLA and NBER Faculty Research Fellow; , formalidad, empren-dimiento, empleo, propiedad de vivienda, consumo, salud, logro y desempeño académico.; Banco de la República de Colombia","Department of National Planning, Confecámaras, MinSalud, Catas-tro Antioquia,; the World Bank's Development Impact Evaluation (DIME) department, 1818 H St. NW, MC 4-404 Washington, DC 20433; sor of Economics at UCLA and NBER Faculty Research Fellow; , formalidad, empren-dimiento, empleo, propiedad de vivienda, consumo, salud, logro y desempeño académico.; Banco de la República de Colombia"
"Global, Regional, and National Cancer Incidence, Mortality, Years of Life Lost, Years Lived With Disability, and Disability-Adjusted Life-Years for 29 Cancer Groups, 1990 to 2017","Cancer and other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are now widely recognized as a threat to global development. The latest United Nations high-level meeting on NCDs reaffirmed this observation and also highlighted the slow progress in meeting the 2011 Political Declaration on the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases and the third Sustainable Development Goal. Lack of situational analyses, priority setting, and budgeting have been identified as major obstacles in achieving these goals. All of these have in common that they require information on the local cancer epidemiology. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study is uniquely poised to provide these crucial data.To describe cancer burden for 29 cancer groups in 195 countries from 1990 through 2017 to provide data needed for cancer control planning.We used the GBD study estimation methods to describe cancer incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Results are presented at the national level as well as by Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income, educational attainment, and total fertility rate. We also analyzed the influence of the epidemiological vs the demographic transition on cancer incidence.In 2017, there were 24.5 million incident cancer cases worldwide (16.8 million without nonmelanoma skin cancer [NMSC]) and 9.6 million cancer deaths. The majority of cancer DALYs came from years of life lost (97%), and only 3% came from years lived with disability. The odds of developing cancer were the lowest in the low SDI quintile (1 in 7) and the highest in the high SDI quintile (1 in 2) for both sexes. In 2017, the most common incident cancers in men were NMSC (4.3 million incident cases); tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer (1.5 million incident cases); and prostate cancer (1.3 million incident cases). The most common causes of cancer deaths and DALYs for men were TBL cancer (1.3 million deaths and 28.4 million DALYs), liver cancer (572 000 deaths and 15.2 million DALYs), and stomach cancer (542 000 deaths and 12.2 million DALYs). For women in 2017, the most common incident cancers were NMSC (3.3 million incident cases), breast cancer (1.9 million incident cases), and colorectal cancer (819 000 incident cases). The leading causes of cancer deaths and DALYs for women were breast cancer (601 000 deaths and 17.4 million DALYs), TBL cancer (596 000 deaths and 12.6 million DALYs), and colorectal cancer (414 000 deaths and 8.3 million DALYs).The national epidemiological profiles of cancer burden in the GBD study show large heterogeneities, which are a reflection of different exposures to risk factors, economic settings, lifestyles, and access to care and screening. The GBD study can be used by policy makers and other stakeholders to develop and improve national and local cancer control in order to achieve the global targets and improve equity in cancer care.",Abbas Balouchi; Abdishakur S.

The Declining Labor Market Prospects of Less-Educated Men,"Over the last half century, US wage growth stagnated, wage inequality rose, and the labor-force participation rate of prime-age men steadily declined. In this article, we examine these worrying labor market trends, focusing on outcomes for males without a college education. Though wages and participation have fallen in tandem for this population, we argue that the canonical neoclassical framework, which postulates a labor demand curve shifting inward across a stable labor supply curve, does not reasonably explain the data. Alternatives we discuss include adjustment frictions associated with labor demand shocks and effects of the changing marriage market—that is, the fact that fewer less-educated men are forming their own stable families—on male labor supply incentives. In the synthesis that emerges, the phenomenon of declining prime-age male labor-force participation is not coherently explained by a series of causal factors acting separately. A more reasonable interpretation, we argue, involves complex feedbacks between labor demand, family structure, and other factors that have disproportionately affected less-educated men.",Ariel Binder; Ariel J.

The Long-Term Effects of Universal Preschool in Boston,"Abstract We use admissions lotteries to estimate the effects of large-scale public preschool in Boston on college-going, college preparation, standardized test scores, and behavioral outcomes. Preschool enrollment boosts college attendance as well as SAT test taking and high school graduation. Preschool also decreases high school disciplinary measures including juvenile incarceration, but has no detectable effect on state achievement test scores. An analysis of subgroups shows that effects on college enrollment, SAT-taking, and disciplinary outcomes are larger for boys than for girls. Our findings illustrate possibilities for large-scale modern, public preschool and highlight the importance of measuring long-term and non–test score outcomes in evaluating the effectiveness of education programs.",Christopher R Walters; Christopher R.

Investing in Early Childhood Development in Preschool and at Home,"The foundations for successful child development are established in early childhood.Two main policy approaches for strengthening these foundations have been subsidized preschool programs and programs targeting the home environment.Our chapter reviews a large body of empirical work investigating whether these programs make a difference for children's development, and if so, how and under what conditions do they help, how cost-effective are they, and which programs are scalable.We start by reviewing studies that estimate how much of the variation in child outcomes can be explained by genetics versus environmental factors.These studies demonstrate that variation in environmental factors plays a key role in explaining individual life outcomes.This suggests that early childhood programs might play a significant role in helping children realize their potential in life.Nevertheless, our review of early childhood programs demonstrates that the evidence is mixed -some programs are successful in fostering lasting skill development, but many are not.We conclude that existing research on early childhood education falls short of sufficiently answering fundamental questions about what works for whom and why.A tighter link between theory, econometric methods and data is essential to compare and reconcile the mixed and sometimes conflicting empirical results across studies, and to understand when and why the impacts of home environment and pre-school interventions fadeout.",Ariel Kalil; Greg Duncan; Greg J.

"Selection into Identification in Fixed Effects Models, with Application to Head Start","Many papers use fixed effects (FE) to identify causal impacts of an intervention.In this paper we show that when the treatment status only varies within some groups, this design can induce nonrandom selection of groups into the identifying sample, which we term selection into identification (SI).We begin by illustrating SI in the context of several family fixed effects (FFE) applications with a binary treatment variable.We document that the FFE identifying sample differs from the overall sample along many dimensions, including having larger families.Further, when treatment effects are heterogeneous, the FFE estimate is biased relative to the average treatment effect (ATE).For the general FE model, we then develop a reweighting-on-observables estimator to recover the unbiased ATE from the FE estimate for policy-relevant populations.We apply these insights to examine the long-term effects of Head Start in the PSID and the CNLSY.Using our reweighting methods, we estimate that Head Start leads to a 2.6 percentage point (p.p.) increase (s.e.= 6.2 p.p.) in the likelihood of attending some college for white Head Start participants in the PSID.This ATE is 78% smaller than the traditional FFE estimate (12 p.p). Reweighting the CNLSY FE estimates to obtain the ATE produces similar attenuation in the estimated impacts of Head Start.",Douglas L.

The Intergenerational Transmission of Poverty and Public Assistance: Evidence from the Earned Income Tax Credit,"This paper examines the intergenerational effects of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) on poverty and public assistance use.Using data from the PSID, we find that increased exposure to the EITC in childhood reduces the use of public assistance in adulthood (WIC and other public assistance) and reduces the likelihood of being in poverty (<100% of poverty) or near poor (<200% of poverty) by about 7 percentage points.These findings build on a growing literature that considers the intergenerational impacts of public policy and suggests that the economic benefits of policies in one generation may have long-term effects on the next generation.",Katherine Michelmore; Natasha Pilkauskas; Nicardo McInnis,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w31429,"Earned income tax credit, Poverty, Economics, Tax credit, Business, Labour economics, Demographic economics, Public economics, Economic growth","National Bureau of Economic Research; California State University, Northridge; University of Michigan–Ann Arbor","University of Michigan 735 S State St 48109-3091 Ann Arbor, MI 48109; School of Public Policy University of Michigan 735 S State St Ann Arbor, MI 48109 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; California State University, Northridge 18111 Nordhoff Street Northridge, CA 91330","University of Michigan 735 S State St 48109-3091 Ann Arbor, MI 48109; School of Public Policy University of Michigan 735 S State St Ann Arbor, MI 48109 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; California State University, Northridge 18111 Nordhoff Street Northridge, CA 91330"
Parental and Student Time Use Around the Academic Year,"We demonstrate how mothers, fathers, and 15-17-year-old students alter their schedules around the K-12 academic year.Using regression discontinuity (RDD) methods, combined with dates on school year start and end dates by locality, we document several notable results.First, mothers are substantially more affected by the school year than are fathers.When school is in session, mothers sleep less, spend more time caring for family members and driving them around, and spend less time on eating, free time and exercise.Fathers see changes that are generally similar in sign but smaller in magnitude compared to mothers.15-17-year-olds naturally reduce time spent in educational pursuits when school is out (a decrease of about 5.5 hours per day on weekdays), and most of that time is substituted toward free time (an additional 2+ hours per day) and sleep (1 + hours per day).Our results provide a holistic picture of how families build their days around the K-12 school calendar and have implications for policies targeted toward women's and teenage children's health and well-being.",Benjamin Cowan; Benjamin R.

"Time Use, College Attainment, and The Working-from-Home Revolution","I demonstrate that the profound change in working from home (WFH) in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic is concentrated among individuals with college degrees.Relative to 2015-19, the number of minutes worked from home on ""post-pandemic"" (August 2021-December 2022) weekdays increased by 78 minutes for college graduates; for non-graduates, it was 22 minutes.The share of work done at home (for those who worked at all) increased by 22% for graduates and 7% for non-graduates.Average minutes worked changed little for either group.Daily time spent traveling (e.g., commuting) fell by 21 minutes for college graduates and 6 minutes for non-graduates.I examine how time-use patterns change for college graduates relative to non-graduates over the same period.College graduates experience a relative shift from eating out to eating at home, an increase in free time, and an increase in time spent with children, with the latter effect being concentrated among fathers.Thus, while the gender gap in childcare among college graduates may be diminished by the WFH revolution, gaps in children's outcomes by parents' college attainment may be exacerbated by it.",Benjamin Cowan; Benjamin R.

Effects of Income on Infant Health: Evidence from the Expanded Child Tax Credit and Pandemic Stimulus Checks,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government issued stimulus checks and expanded the child tax credit.These pandemic payments varied by marital status and the number of children in the household and were substantial with some families receiving several thousand dollars.We exploit this plausibly exogenous variation in income to obtain estimates of the effect income on infant health.We measure the total amount of pandemic payments received during pregnancy, or the year before birth, and examine how this additional income affects birthweight, the incidence of low birth weight, gestational age and fetal growth.Data are from birth certificates and analyses are conducted separately by maternal marital status and education (less than high school or high school) to isolate only the variation in pandemic payments due to differences in the number of children (parity).Estimates indicate that these pandemic cash payments had no statistically significant, or clinically or economically meaningful effects on infant health.Overall, the findings suggest that income transfers during pregnancy will have little effect on socioeconomic disparities in infant health.",George L.

Lives vs. Livelihoods: The Impact of the Great Recession on Mortality and Welfare,"We leverage spatial variation in the severity of the Great Recession across the United States to examine its impact on mortality and to explore implications for the welfare consequences of recessions.We estimate that an increase in the unemployment rate of the magnitude of the Great Recession reduces the average, annual age-adjusted mortality rate by 2.3 percent, with effects persisting for at least 10 years.Mortality reductions appear across causes of death and are concentrated in the half of the population with a high school degree or less.We estimate similar percentage reductions in mortality at all ages, with declines in elderly mortality thus responsible for about three-quarters of the total mortality reduction.Recession-induced mortality declines are driven primarily by external effects of reduced aggregate economic activity on mortality, and recession-induced reductions in air pollution appear to be a quantitatively important mechanism.Incorporating our estimates of pro-cyclical mortality into a standard macroeconomics framework substantially reduces the welfare costs of recessions, particularly for people with less education, and at older ages where they may even be welfare-improving.",Amy Finkelstein; Frank Schilbach; Jonathan Zhang; Matthew Notowidigdo,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w32110,"Livelihood, Welfare, Recession, Great recession, Economics, Demographic economics, Development economics, Geography, Labour economics, Keynesian economics, Market economy, Agriculture, Archaeology",University of Chicago; University of Virginia; University of Illinois Chicago; American Economic Association; Princeton University; McMaster University; IIT@MIT; National Bureau of Economic Research,"participants at the American Economic Association annual meeting, Ben Gurion University, Columbia University, the Chicago Health Economics Workshop, Chicago Booth, Chicago Harris, Dartmouth, the FAIR (NHH-Bergen) Online Seminar,; McMaster University Kenneth Taylor Hall, Room 441 1280 Main Street West Hamilton, ON, L8S 4M4 Canada; Harvard University, Hebrew University, MIT, NBER Summer Institute, Princeton University, Stanford University, Tel Aviv University, the University of Illinois at Chicago, the; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; University of Chicago Booth School of Business 5807 S Woodlawn Ave Chicago, IL 60637; University of Virginia,; Department of Economics, E52-442 MIT 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02139 and; MIT Department of Economics, E52-560 The Morris and Sophie Chang Building 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02139 and","participants at the American Economic Association annual meeting, Ben Gurion University, Columbia University, the Chicago Health Economics Workshop, Chicago Booth, Chicago Harris, Dartmouth, the FAIR (NHH-Bergen) Online Seminar,; McMaster University Kenneth Taylor Hall, Room 441 1280 Main Street West Hamilton, ON, L8S 4M4 Canada; Harvard University, Hebrew University, MIT, NBER Summer Institute, Princeton University, Stanford University, Tel Aviv University, the University of Illinois at Chicago, the; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; University of Chicago Booth School of Business 5807 S Woodlawn Ave Chicago, IL 60637; University of Virginia,; Department of Economics, E52-442 MIT 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02139 and; MIT Department of Economics, E52-560 The Morris and Sophie Chang Building 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02139 and"
"The Changing Nature of Pollution, Income, and Environmental Inequality in the United States","This paper uses administrative tax records linked to Census demographic data and high-resolution measures of fine small particulate (PM2.5)exposure to study the evolution of the Black-White pollution exposure gap over the past 40 years.In doing so, we focus on the various ways in which income may have contributed to these changes using a statistical decomposition.We decompose the overall change in the Black-White PM2.5 exposure gap into (1) components that stem from rank-preserving compression in the overall pollution distribution and (2) changes that stem from a reordering of Black and White households within the pollution distribution.We find a significant narrowing of the Black-White PM2.5 exposure gap over this time period that is overwhelmingly driven by rank-preserving changes rather than positional changes.However, the relative positions of Black and White households at the upper end of the pollution distribution have meaningfully shifted in the most recent years.",John Voorheis; Jonathan Colmer; Reed Walker; Suvy Qin,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w32060,"Inequality, Economic inequality, Pollution, Environmental pollution, Environmental science, Geography, Economics, Environmental protection, Mathematics, Ecology, Biology, Mathematical analysis","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Berkeley; United States Census Bureau; University of Virginia","University of Virginia; Haas School of Business Department of Economics University of California Berkeley 2220 Piedmont Avenue Berkeley, CA 94720 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; University of California Berkeley; U.S. Census Bureau","University of Virginia; Haas School of Business Department of Economics University of California Berkeley 2220 Piedmont Avenue Berkeley, CA 94720 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; University of California Berkeley; U.S. Census Bureau"
THE PARADOX OF THE PILL: HETEROGENEOUS EFFECTS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE ACCESS,"The twentieth century saw dramatic increases in nonmarital births, concentrated heavily among poor and working‐class women. In this paper, we investigate whether the oral contraceptive pill played a causal role in the rise of nonmarital births. Exploiting exogenous variation in laws governing access to the pill, we find that changes in marital access to the pill increased the nonmarital birthrate by between 15% and 18%, accounting for about one‐third of the overall increase in nonmarital births. These effects are concentrated almost entirely among women whose fathers did not graduate high school and among minority women. We also document that the pill increased spacing between first and second births, and lowered the probability that a woman obtained a high‐school diploma, consistent with increases in nonmarital births. We find no evidence that postsecondary education levels were influenced by pill access, and no evidence that nonmarital births move with male employment patterns. Our findings add to a growing literature which documents the power of the pill to shape women's lives in broadly heterogenous ways, with minority and less‐well‐educated women bearing the brunt of the losses, a phenomenon we call the paradox of the pill.

Heterogeneous Effects of Health Insurance on Birth Related Outcomes: Unpacking Compositional vs. Direct Changes,"When women of childbearing age gain health insurance, we expect their birth outcomes to improve, but comparing births that occur before and after policy changes may confound two separate impacts of coverage. For one, health insurance could affect who gives birth, through reduced costs of contraception. Health insurance could also directly improve maternal and child health among those who give birth, through additional prenatal resources. We address this question using the Affordable Care Act young adult provision, comparing birth related outcomes for those aged 24-25 years after the law, to outcomes among older young adults. We show that since the law subsidized contraceptives mainly among higher socioeconomic groups, the composition of mothers shifted towards less advantaged groups. Accounting for this shift, we find evidence of direct improvements in prenatal care and pregnancy-related health (reduced gestational diabetes and hypertension).Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",Jie Ma; Kosali Ilayperuma Simon; Kosali Simon,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3679721,"Unpacking, Business, Health insurance, Actuarial science, Economics, Health care, Economic growth, Philosophy, Linguistics",National Bureau of Economic Research; Indiana University Bloomington; Xi'an Jiaotong University,Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU); Indiana University Bloomington - School of Public & Environmental Affairs (SPEA); National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER),Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU); Indiana University Bloomington - School of Public & Environmental Affairs (SPEA); National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)

The Evolution of Market Power in the U.S. Automobile Industry,"Abstract We construct measures of industry performance and welfare in the U.S. automobile market from 1980 to 2018. We estimate a demand model using product-level data on market shares, prices, and attributes, and consumer-level data on demographics, purchases, and stated second choices. We estimate marginal costs assuming Nash-Bertrand pricing. We relate trends in consumer welfare and markups to trends in market structure and the composition of products. Although real prices rose, we find that markups decreased substantially, and the fraction of total surplus accruing to consumers increased. Consumer welfare increased over time due to improved product quality and improved production technology.",Ali Yurukoglu; Ali Yürükoğlu; Charles Murry; Paul L E Grieco; Paul L.E.

Do Increasing Markups Matter? Lessons from Empirical Industrial Organization,"This article considers the recent literature on firm markups in light of both new and classic work in the field of industrial organization. We detail the shortcomings of papers that rely on discredited approaches from the “structure-conduct-performance” literature. In contrast, papers based on production function estimation have made useful progress in measuring broad trends in markups. However, industries are so heterogeneous that careful industry-specific studies are also required, and sorely needed. Examples of such studies illustrate differing explanations for rising markups, including endogenous increases in fixed costs associated with lower marginal costs. In some industries there is evidence of price increases driven by mergers. To fully understand markups, we must eventually recover the key economic primitives of demand, marginal cost, and fixed and sunk costs. We end by discussing the various aspects of antitrust enforcement that may be of increasing importance regardless of the cause of increased markups.",Fiona Scott Morton; Martin Gaynor; Steven Berry,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.33.3.44,"Economics, Sunk costs, Marginal cost, Industrial organization, Fixed cost, Microeconomics, Function (biology), Biology, Evolutionary biology",National Bureau of Economic Research; Yale University; Carnegie Mellon University,"Fiona Scott Morton is the Theodore Nierenberg Professor of Economics, Yale School of Management, New Haven, Connecticut.

Trade Policy and Global Sourcing: An Efficiency Rationale for Tariff Escalation,"Import tariffs tend to be higher for final goods than for inputs, a phenomenon commonly referred to as tariff escalation.Yet neoclassical trade theory -and modern Ricardian trade models, in particular -predict that welfare-maximizing tariffs are uniform across sectors.We show that tariff escalation can be rationalized on efficiency grounds in the presence of scale economies.When both downstream and upstream sectors produce under increasing returns to scale, a unilateral tariff in either sector boosts the size and productivity of that sector, raising welfare.While these forces are reinforced up the chain for final-good tariffs, input tariffs may drive finalgood producers to relocate abroad, mitigating their potential productivity benefits.The welfare benefits of final-good tariffs thus tend to be larger, with the optimal degree of tariff escalation increasing in the extent of downstream returns to scale.A quantitative evaluation of the US-China trade war demonstrates that any welfare gains from the increase in US tariffs are overwhelmingly driven by final-good tariffs.",Agustín Gutiérrez; Felix Tintelnot; Pol Antràs; Teresa Fort,,,,,,,,,,,,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w30225,"Tariff, International trade, De-escalation, Business, International economics, Rules of origin, Insourcing, Commercial policy, Strategic sourcing, Economics, Industrial organization, Outsourcing, Marketing, Political science, Law, Strategic financial management, Strategic planning",University of Chicago; Harvard University Press; National Bureau of Economic Research; Dartmouth College; South University,"NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of Chicago 5757 South University Avenue Chicago, IL 60637; Department of Economics Harvard University 1805 Cambridge Street Littauer Center 207 Cambridge, MA 02138 and; Tuck School of Business Dartmouth College 100 Tuck Hall Hanover, NH 03755","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of Chicago 5757 South University Avenue Chicago, IL 60637; Department of Economics Harvard University 1805 Cambridge Street Littauer Center 207 Cambridge, MA 02138 and; Tuck School of Business Dartmouth College 100 Tuck Hall Hanover, NH 03755"

Cats and dogs,"We investigate the fine grained object categorization problem of determining the breed of animal from an image. To this end we introduce a new annotated dataset of pets covering 37 different breeds of cats and dogs. The visual problem is very challenging as these animals, particularly cats, are very deformable and there can be quite subtle differences between the breeds. We make a number of contributions: first, we introduce a model to classify a pet breed automatically from an image. The model combines shape, captured by a deformable part model detecting the pet face, and appearance, captured by a bag-of-words model that describes the pet fur. Fitting the model involves automatically segmenting the animal in the image. Second, we compare two classification approaches: a hierarchical one, in which a pet is first assigned to the cat or dog family and then to a breed, and a flat one, in which the breed is obtained directly. We also investigate a number of animal and image orientated spatial layouts. These models are very good: they beat all previously published results on the challenging ASIRRA test (cat vs dog discrimination). When applied to the task of discriminating the 37 different breeds of pets, the models obtain an average accuracy of about 59%, a very encouraging result considering the difficulty of the problem.",A.

How Far Goods Travel: Global Transport and Supply Chains from 1965–2020,"This paper considers the evolution of global transportation usage over the past half century and its implications for supply chains. Transportation usage has more than doubled as costs decreased by a third. Participation of emerging economies in world trade and longer-distance trade between countries contribute to this usage increase, thereby encouraging longer supply chains. We discuss technological advances over this period, and their interactions with endogenous responses from transportation costs and supply chain linkages. Supply chains involving more countries and longer distances are reflective of reliable and efficient transportat ion, but are also more exposed to disruptions, highlighting the importance of considering the interconnectedness of transportation and supply chains in policymaking and future work.",Sharat Ganapati; Woan Foong Wong,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.37.3.3,"Supply chain, Supply side, Work (physics), Industrial organization, Business, Economics, International trade, Commerce, Marketing, Engineering, Mechanical engineering",National Bureau of Economic Research; Georgetown University; University of Oregon,"Sharat Ganapati is Assistant Professor of International Economics, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, and Faculty Research Fellow, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Woan Foong Wong is Assistant Professor of Economics, University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon.","Sharat Ganapati is Assistant Professor of International Economics, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, and Faculty Research Fellow, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Woan Foong Wong is Assistant Professor of Economics, University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon."

<i>FBBVA Lecture 2022:</i> What Drives Wage Stagnation: Monopsony or Monopoly?,"Abstract Wages for the vast majority of workers have stagnated since the 1980s while, productivity has grown. We investigate two coexisting explanations based on rising market power: (1) monopsony, where dominant firms exploit the limited mobility of their own workers to pay lower wages; and (2) monopoly, where dominant firms charge too high prices for what they sell, which lowers production and the demand for labor, and hence equilibrium wages economy-wide. Using establishment data from the US Census Bureau between 1997 and 2016, we find evidence of both monopoly and monopsony, where the former is rising over this period and the latter is stable. Both contribute to the decoupling of productivity and wage growth, with monopoly being the primary determinant: In 2016, monopoly accounts for 75% of wage stagnation, monopsony for 25%.",Aseem Patel; Jan Eeckhout; Lawrence Warren; Shubhdeep Deb,,,,,,,,,,,,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/jeea/jvac060,"Monopsony, Monopoly, Economics, Wage, Productivity, Labour economics, Efficiency wage, Market power, Microeconomics, Macroeconomics",University of Essex; Universitat Pompeu Fabra; Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats; United States Census Bureau,"Universitat Pompeu Fabra—ICREA-BSE-CREI , Spain; University of Essex , UK; US Census Bureau , USA; Universitat Pompeu Fabra , Spain","Universitat Pompeu Fabra—ICREA-BSE-CREI , Spain; University of Essex , UK; US Census Bureau , USA; Universitat Pompeu Fabra , Spain"
The Anatomy of Concentration: New Evidence From a Unified Framework,"Concentration is a single summary statistic driven by two opposing forces: the number of firms in a market and the evenness of their market shares.This paper introduces a generalized measure of concentration that allows researchers to vary the relative importance of each force.Using the generalized measure, we show that the widely-cited evidence of increasing industrial employment concentration is driven by the Herfindahl Index's over-weighting of evenness and underweighting of firm counts.We propose an alternative, equally-weighted measure that has an equivalent economic meaning as the Herfindahl Index, but possesses superior statistical attributes in typical firm size distributions.Using this balanced measure, we find that employment concentration decreased from 1990 to 2020.Finally, decomposing aggregate diversity into meaningful geographic and industry subdivisions reveals that concentration within regional markets has fallen, while concentration between markets has risen.",Kenneth Ahern; Lei Kong; Xinyan Yan,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w32057,"Anatomy, Computer science, Biology",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Alabama; University of South Florida; University of Southern California,"Marshall School of Business University of Southern California 3670 Trousdale Parkway, HOH 718 Los Angeles, CA 90089; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; NBER Working Paper No. 32057; The University of Alabama Alston 233 Tuscaloosa, AL 35487; University of South Florida","Marshall School of Business University of Southern California 3670 Trousdale Parkway, HOH 718 Los Angeles, CA 90089; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; NBER Working Paper No. 32057; The University of Alabama Alston 233 Tuscaloosa, AL 35487; University of South Florida"
Gains from Trade with Flexible Extensive Margin Adjustment,"We propose a new sufficient statistic to measure the gains from trade in models where the extensive margin trade elasticity is not necessarily constant.This statistic is a function of one data moment, the market share of continuing domestic products, and one parameter, the elasticity of substitution between products.It measures the gains from trade in a Ricardian model with any productivity distribution or a Melitz model with any productivity distribution and any pattern of selection into production and exporting.We apply our statistic to measure Canada's gains from the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement and find that they are smaller than suggested by statistics that assume a constant extensive margin response of trade.",Chang-Tai Hsieh; Chang‐Tai Hsieh; Mu-Jeung Yang; Nicholas Li; Ralph Ossa,,,,,,,,,,,,2016.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w22069,"Margin (machine learning), Statistic, Econometrics, Economics, Constant elasticity of substitution, Productivity, Elasticity (physics), Sufficient statistic, Production (economics), Statistics, Elasticity of substitution, Mathematics, Microeconomics, Computer science, Macroeconomics, Materials science, Machine learning, Composite material",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Toronto; University of Chicago; University of Zurich,"University of Zurich Department of Economics Schoenberggasse 1 8001 Zuerich Switzerland; David Eccles School of Business Salt Lake City, UT USA; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Booth School of Business University of Chicago 5807 S Woodlawn Ave Chicago, IL 60637 and; University of Toronto 150 St. George Street Toronto, ON M5S 3G7 Canada","University of Zurich Department of Economics Schoenberggasse 1 8001 Zuerich Switzerland; David Eccles School of Business Salt Lake City, UT USA; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Booth School of Business University of Chicago 5807 S Woodlawn Ave Chicago, IL 60637 and; University of Toronto 150 St. George Street Toronto, ON M5S 3G7 Canada"
"Size, Trade, Technology and the Division of Labor","We model the implications of the classical ideas that larger markets allow for a finer division of labor and this division feeds back into larger market size.Market size affects specialization due to firm-level increasing returns to scale arising from fixed costs of adopting intermediate-intensive technologies.The impacts are magnified in general equilibrium by an endogenous multiplierdue to input-output linkages in a roundabout structure-and a selection effect due to heterogeneous fundamental productivity and entry costs.Market size expansions imply (i) larger real income gains than under fixed specialization; (ii) an increase in the aggregate variable cost share for intermediates and a decrease for labor; (iii) increased concentration;(iv) increased average productivity for survivors; and (v) an increase in the intermediate trade share.We derive similar results for intermediate productivity improvements.The effects in (ii)-(v) are absent in a similar model with exogenous specialization.In a calibration to U.S. manufacturing in 1987-2007 we isolate trade and intermediate productivity shocks, quantify their effects.Trade cost reductions increased effective market size by 7 log points (lp) and generated (i) a real income gain 1.4 times higher than under exogenous specialization; (ii) increases in the intermediate share in production and trade of 2 lp and a reduction in the labor share of value added of similar magnitude.Two counterfactuals highlight the importance of industrial and trade policy.First, a tax that induces firms to specialize increases real income; so the initial equilibrium is inefficient.Second, an increase in trade costs of 16 lpsimilar to the recent trade war-reduces market size and real income substantially: almost half way to trade autarky.",Nuno Limão; Yang Xu,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w28969,"Division of labour, Division (mathematics), Economics, Business, Mathematics, Arithmetic, Market economy","National Bureau of Economic Research; Xiamen University; University of Maryland, College Park","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of Maryland 3105 Tydings Hall College Park, MD 20742 and; SOE & WISE, Xiamen University","SOE & WISE, Xiamen University; Department of Economics University of Maryland 3105 Tydings Hall College Park, MD 20742 and; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138"
The Purchasing Power Parity Debate,"Originally propounded by the sixteenth-century scholars of the University of Salamanca, the concept of purchasing power parity (PPP) was revived in the interwar period in the context of the debate concerning the appropriate level at which to re-establish international exchange rate parities. Broadly accepted as a long-run equilibrium condition in the post-war period, it was first advocated as a short-run equilibrium by many international economists in the first few years following the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s and then increasingly came under attack on both theoretical and empirical grounds from the late 1970s to the mid 1990s. Accordingly, over the last three decades, a large literature has built up that examines how much the data deviated from theory, and the fruits of this research have provided a deeper understanding of how well PPP applies in both the short run and the long run. Since the mid 1990s, larger datasets and nonlinear econometric methods, in particular, have improved estimation. As deviations narrowed between real exchange rates and PPP, so did the gap narrow between theory and data, and some degree of confidence in long-run PPP began to emerge again. In this respect, the idea of long-run PPP now enjoys perhaps its strongest support in more than thirty years, a distinct reversion in economic thought. Our willingness to pay a certain price for foreign money must ultimately and essentially be due to the fact that this money possesses a purchasing power as against commodities and services in that country. On the other hand, when we offer so and so much of our own money, we are actually offering a purchasing power as against commodities and services in our own country. Our valuation of a foreign currency in terms of our own, therefore, mainly depends on the relative purchasing power of the two currencies in their respective countries.",Alan M Taylor; Alan M.

Using Eurostat data, we find that when heterogeneity is taken into account, the estimated persistence of real exchange rates falls dramatically. Its half-life, for instance, may fall to as low as eleven months, significantly below the “consensus view” of three to five years.",Haroon Mumtaz; Helene Rey; Hélène Rey; Jean Imbs; Morten O.

Exchange Rate Models Are Not as Bad as You Think,"Standard models of exchange rates, based on macroeconomic variables such as prices, interest rates, output, etc., are thought by many researchers to have failed empirically.We present evidence to the contrary.First, we emphasize the point that ""beating a random walk"" in forecasting is too strong a criterion for accepting an exchange rate model.Typically models should have low forecasting power of this type.We then propose a number of alternative ways to evaluate models.We examine in-sample fit, but emphasize the importance of the monetary policy rule, and its effects on expectations, in determining exchange rates.Next we present evidence that exchange rates incorporate news about future macroeconomic fundamentals, as the models imply.We demonstrate that the models might well be able to account for observed exchange-rate volatility.We discuss studies that examine the response of exchange rates to announcements of economic data.Then we present estimates of exchange-rate models in which expected present values of fundamentals are calculated from survey forecasts.Finally, we show that out-of-sample forecasting power of models can be increased by focusing on panel estimation and long-horizon forecasts.",Charles Engel; Kenneth D.

International Transfer Pricing and Tax Avoidance: Evidence from the Linked Tax-Trade Statistics in the UK,"This paper employs unique data on export transactions and corporate tax returns of UK multinational firms and finds that firms manipulate their transfer prices to shift profits to lower-taxed destinations. It uncovers three new findings on tax-motivated transfer mispricing in real goods. First, transfer mispricing increases substantially when taxation of foreign profits changes from a worldwide to a territorial approach in the UK, with multinationals shifting more profits into low-tax jurisdictions. Second, transfer mispricing increases with a firm's R&D intensity. Third, tax-motivated transfer mispricing is concentrated in countries that are not tax havens and have low-to-medium-level corporate tax rates.",Dongxian Guo; Li Liu; Tim Schmidt-Eisenlohr; Tim Schmidt‐Eisenlohr,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3009883,"Transfer pricing, Multinational corporation, Monetary economics, Tax avoidance, International economics, Business, Economics, Transfer (computing), Double taxation, Value-added tax, Ad valorem tax, Corporate tax, Public economics, Finance, Parallel computing, Computer science",Federal Reserve; Federal Reserve Board of Governors; University of Oxford,University of Oxford - Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation; University of Oxford - Said Business School; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,University of Oxford - Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation; University of Oxford - Said Business School; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

Unit Value Indexes for Exports – New Developments Using Administrative Trade Data,"Abstract U.S. import and export price indexes replaced unit value indexes forty years ago, given quality concerns of mismeasurement due to unit value bias. The administrative trade data underlying the unit values have greatly improved since that time. The transaction records are now more detailed, available electronically, and compiled monthly with little delay. The data are used by academic researchers to calculate price measures, and unit value indexes based on trade data are used by other national statistical offices (NSOs). The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is now evaluating whether replacing price indexes with unit value indexes for homogeneous products calculated from administrative trade data could expand the number of published official import and export price indexes. Using export transactions, the research calculates detailed unit value indexes from 200 + million trade records from 2012–2017 for 123 export product categories. Results show that 27 of the 123 unit value indexes are homogeneous and closely comparable to published official price indexes. This article presents the concepts and methods considered to calculate and evaluate the unit value indexes and to select the product categories that are homogeneous. Compared to official price indexes, export unit value indexes for the 27 5-digit BEA (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis) end-use product categories would deflate real exports of these goods by 13 percentage points less over the period. Incorporating these 27 indexes into the top-level XPI would increase the value of real exports of all merchandise goods by 2.6 percentage points at the end of 2017.",Dominic A.

The aggregate effects of global and local supply chain disruptions: 2020–2022,"We study the aggregate effects of supply-chain disruptions in the post-pandemic period in a heterogeneous-firm, general equilibrium model with input-output linkages and a rich set of supply chain frictions: uncertain shipping delays, fixed order costs, and storage costs. Firms optimally hold inventories that depend on the source of supply, domestic or imported. Increases in shipping times are contractionary, raise prices, and increase stockouts, particularly for goods intensive in delayed inputs. These effects are larger when inventories are already at low levels. We fit the model to the U.S. and global economies from 2020 to 2022 and estimate large aggregate effects of supply disruptions. Our model predicts that the boost in output from reducing delays will be smaller than the contraction from the waning effects of stimulus.",Armen Khederlarian; Carter Mix; George Alessandria; Kim J.

"Learning by Necessity: Government Demand, Capacity Constraints, and Productivity Growth","This paper studies how firms adapt to demand shocks when facing capacity constraints. I show that increases in government purchases raise total factor productivity in quantity units at the production line level. Productivity gains are concentrated in plants facing tighter capacity constraints, a phenomenon I call “learning by necessity.” Evidence is based on newly digitized archival data on US World War II aircraft production. Shifts in demand across aircraft with different strategic roles provide an instrument for aircraft demand. I show that plants adapted to surging demand by improving production methods, outsourcing, and combating absenteeism, primarily when facing tighter capacity constraints.

The Unemployment-Inflation Trade-off Revisited: The Phillips Curve in COVID Times,"We estimate the natural rate of unemployment, often referred to as u*, in the United States using data on labor market flows, short-term and long-term inflation expectations and a forwardlooking New-Keynesian Phillips curve for the 1960-2021 period.The natural rate of unemployment was at around 4.5% before the onset of the pandemic and increased to 5.9% by the end of 2021.This pronounced rise was primarily informed by strong wage growth rather than changes in inflation expectations.Despite the rise in the natural rate of unemployment, the secular trend of unemployment continued to fall and stands at around 4.2% reflecting ongoing secular developments which have been pushing down the unemployment rate over the last 30 years.Our model forecasts strong wage growth to moderate only sluggishly continuing to put upward pressure on inflation in the medium-run.We project underlying inflation to remain 0.5 percentage points above its long-run trend by the end of 2023 even if long-run inflation expectations remain well anchored.Given the importance of wage growth for the inflation outlook, we examine detailed micro data on job-filling rates, posted wages for vacant positions, and workers' reservation wages.In particular, we construct a composition-bias free measure of wage growth at the employer-job level using Burning Glass Technologies data and document strong wage growth for both teleworkable and non-teleworkable jobs.Moreover, we find that workers' reservation wages increased substantially after the pandemic.Our empirical analysis suggests that the strong wage growth is likely not a one-time adjustment of additional compensation for jobs that pose health risks to workers but rather reflects a tight labor market accompanied with a changing work-leisure trade-off.",Ayşegül Şahin; Marc Giannoni; Richard Crump; Richard K.

The price of remoteness: Product availability and local cost of living in Ethiopia,"This paper uses the microdata underlying the Ethiopian CPI to examine the spatial dispersion in local prices and availability of 400 items across more than 100 cities. We first show that remote cities face higher prices for individual products and have access to fewer products. All else equal, large cities also face higher individual prices but enjoy access to a wider set of products. To assess the welfare implications of these micro patterns, we then examine the impact of remoteness and population size on aggregate cost-of-living indexes that account for product availability. We find the cost of living is higher in remote areas, but not systematically related to population size. We then show spatial differences in the cost of living are a significant determinant of migration flows across Ethiopian regions. The impact of cost of living mainly channels through spatial differences in product availability.",Ewane Theophile; Florian Mayneris; Julien Martin,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,,"Microdata (statistics), Cost of living, Product (mathematics), Population, Welfare, Economics, Business, Geography, Agricultural economics, Demographic economics, Economic growth, Demography, Census, Market economy, Geometry, Mathematics, Sociology",,,

Mapping the diversity of land uses following deforestation across Africa,"Abstract African forest are increasingly in decline as a result of land-use conversion due to human activities. However, a consistent and detailed characterization and mapping of land-use change that results in forest loss is not available at the spatial-temporal resolution and thematic levels suitable for decision-making at the local and regional scales; so far they have only been provided on coarser scales and restricted to humid forests. Here we present the first high-resolution (5 m) and continental-scale mapping of land use following deforestation in Africa, which covers an estimated 13.85% of the global forest area, including humid and dry forests. We use reference data for 15 different land-use types from 30 countries and implement an active learning framework to train a deep learning model for predicting land-use following deforestation with an F1-score of $$84\pm 0.7$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:mrow> <mml:mn>84</mml:mn> <mml:mo>±</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0.7</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> for the whole of Africa. Our results show that the causes of forest loss vary by region. In general, small-scale cropland is the dominant driver of forest loss in Africa, with hotspots in Madagascar and DRC. In addition, commodity crops such as cacao, oil palm, and rubber are the dominant drivers of forest loss in the humid forests of western and central Africa, forming an “arc of commodity crops” in that region. At the same time, the hotspots for cashew are found to increasingly dominate in the dry forests of both western and south-eastern Africa, while larger hotspots for large-scale croplands were found in Nigeria and Zambia. The increased expansion of cacao, cashew, oil palm, rubber, and large-scale croplands observed in humid and dry forests of western and south-eastern Africa suggests they are vulnerable to future land-use changes by commodity crops, thus creating challenges for achieving the zero deforestation supply chains, support REDD+ initiatives, and towards sustainable development goals.",Diego Marcos; Itohan-Osa Abu; Itohan‐Osa Abu; Jan Verbesselt; Johannes Reiche; Martin Herold; Robert N.

Global patterns of marine turtle bycatch,"Abstract Fisheries bycatch is a primary driver of population declines in several species of marine megafauna (e.g., elasmobranchs, mammals, seabirds, turtles). Characterizing the global bycatch seascape using data on bycatch rates across fisheries is essential for highlighting conservation priorities. We compiled a comprehensive database of reported data on marine turtle bycatch in gillnet, longline, and trawl fisheries worldwide from 1990 to 2008. The total reported global marine turtle bycatch was ∼85,000 turtles, but due to the small percentage of fishing effort observed and reported (typically &lt;1% of total fleets), and to a global lack of bycatch information from small‐scale fisheries, this likely underestimates the true total by at least two orders of magnitude. Our synthesis also highlights an apparently universal pattern across fishing gears and regions where high bycatch rates were associated with low observed effort, which emphasizes the need for strategic bycatch data collection and reporting. This study provides the first global perspective of fisheries bycatch for marine turtles and highlights region–gear combinations that warrant urgent conservation action (e.g., gillnets, longlines, and trawls in the Mediterranean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean) and region–gear combinations in need of enhanced observation and reporting efforts (e.g., eastern Indian Ocean gillnets, West African trawls).",Bryan P.

"Mapping the global prevalence, incidence, and mortality of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria, 2000–22: a spatial and temporal modelling study","Malaria remains a leading cause of illness and death globally, with countries in sub-Saharan Africa bearing a disproportionate burden. Global high-resolution maps of malaria prevalence, incidence, and mortality are crucial for tracking spatially heterogeneous progress against the disease and to inform strategic malaria control efforts. We present the latest such maps, the first since 2019, which cover the years 2000-22. The maps are accompanied by administrative-level summaries and include estimated COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts on malaria burden. We initially modelled prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection in children aged 2-10 years in high-burden African countries using a geostatistical modelling framework. The model was trained on a large database of spatiotemporal observations of community infection prevalence; environmental and anthropogenic covariates; and modelled intervention coverages for insecticide-treated bednets, indoor residual spraying, and effective treatment with an antimalarial drug. We developed an additional model to incorporate disruptions to malaria case management caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The resulting high-resolution maps of infection prevalence from 2000 to 2022 were subsequently translated to estimates of case incidence and malaria mortality. For other malaria-endemic countries and for Plasmodium vivax estimates, we used routine surveillance data to model annual case incidence at administrative levels. We then converted these estimates to infection prevalence and malaria mortality, and spatially disaggregated administrative-level results to produce high-resolution maps. Lastly, we combined the modelled outputs to produce global maps and summarised tables that are suitable for assessing changing malaria burden from subnational to global scales. We found an ongoing plateau in rates of malaria infection prevalence and case incidence within sub-Saharan Africa, with consistent year-on-year improvements not evident since 2015. Due to the concentration of malaria burden in sub-Saharan Africa and the region's rapid population growth relative to other endemic regions, we estimate that 2022 had 234·8 (95% uncertainty interval 179·2-299·0) million clinical cases of P falciparum malaria, the most since 2004. Despite these findings, deaths from malaria continued to decline in sub-Saharan Africa and consequently globally after 2015, except for the COVID-19-impacted years of 2020-22. Similarly, progress in reducing P falciparum and P vivax morbidity outside Africa continued despite stalled progress globally. However, a major malaria outbreak in Pakistan following intense flooding in 2022 resulted in a reversal in this improving trend and contributed heavily to the global total of 12·4 (10·7-14·8) million clinical cases of P vivax malaria. Within Africa, we found that the plateau in infection prevalence occurred earlier in more densely populated areas, whereas more sparsely populated regions have continued a trajectory of modest improvement. The unprecedented investment in malaria control since the early 2000s has averted an enormous amount of malaria burden. However, case incidence rates in Africa have flattened, and with a rapidly growing population at risk, the number of P falciparum cases in Africa, and thus globally, is now comparable to levels before the surge of investment. Outside Africa progress against malaria morbidity continued after 2015, but a resurgence of P vivax cases in 2022 underscores the fragility of progress against malaria in the face of climatic shocks. COVID-19-related disruptions led to increased malaria cases and deaths, but the impact was less severe than feared, in part because endemic countries continued to prioritise malaria control during the pandemic. Nevertheless, improved tools and strategies remain urgently needed to regain momentum against this disease.

The report is devoted to the role and effectiveness of the state: what it should do, how it should do it, and how it can improve in a rapidly changing world. Governments with both centrally-planned and mixed economies are shrinking their market role because of failed state interventions. This report takes an opposite stance: that state's role in the institutional environment underlying the economy, that is, its ability to enforce a rule of law to underpin transactions, is vital to making government contribute more effectively to development. It argues against reducing government to a minimalist state, explaining that development requires an effective state that plays a facilitator role in encouraging and complementing the activities of private businesses and individuals. The report presents a state reform framework strategy: First, focus the state's activities to match its capabilities; and second, look for ways to improve the state's capability by re-invigorating public institutions. Successful and unsuccessful examples of states and state reform provide illustrations.

Fund Flows and Income Risk of Fund Managers,"Investment fund managers, with their specialized skills, make daily trading and asset allocation decisions in financial markets for a major portion of U.S. households. Their role is unique and pivotal in shaping capital market valuations and building wealth for households. To fully grasp their impact on capital markets and the broader economy, it's imperative to examine their incentives and the income and career risk they confront. To achieve this objective, this paper creates a unique and novel dataset detailing the compensation and employment history of managers in U.S. active equity mutual funds. Specifically, we integrate data from CRSP, Morningstar, and U.S. Census LEHD, leveraging various ``big'' textual data sources, including mutual fund prospectus, LexisNexis, and CoreLogic. We find that, contrary to their self-disclosures, funds' AUMs are the primary driver of their managers' compensation, with both fund flows and performance influencing compensation via AUM. Fund flows -- outside fund clients' interests -- exert significant influence on managers' compensation. Specifically, a one-standard-deviation surge in fund flows is associated with a statistically significant increase in compensation by about 6\%. These fund flows, when broken down, show that their systematic components affect the base pay, while idiosyncratic elements influence bonuses. Importantly, fund flows, as opposed to fund performance, exert a strong impact on the career outcomes of fund managers, especially concerning their downside career risk. For instance, large fund outflows elevate a manager's likelihood of job turnover (with a substantial decline in income) by 4 percentage points.",Leonid Kogan; Wei Wu; Winston Wei Dou; Xiao Cen,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4562474,"Income fund, Sovereign wealth fund, Business, Target date fund, Fund administration, Manager of managers fund, Investment fund, Finance, Open-end fund, Economics, Microeconomics, Institutional investor, Corporate governance, Market liquidity, Incentive",Mitchell Institute; Texas A&M University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Texas A&M University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - Sloan School of Management; Mays Business School, Texas A&M University","The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); Texas A&M University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - Sloan School of Management; Mays Business School, Texas A&M University"
Artificial Intelligence and Economic Growth,"This paper examines the potential impact of artificial intelligence (A.I.) on economic growth.We model A.I. as the latest form of automation, a broader process dating back more than 200 years.Electricity, internal combustion engines, and semiconductors facilitated automation in the last century, but A.I. now seems poised to automate many tasks once thought to be out of reach, from driving cars to making medical recommendations and beyond.How will this affect economic growth and the division of income between labor and capital?What about the potential emergence of ""singularities"" and ""superintelligence,"" concepts that animate many discussions in the machine intelligence community?How will the linkages between A.I. and growth be mediated by firm-level considerations, including organization and market structure?The goal throughout is to refine a set of critical questions about A.I. and economic growth and to contribute to shaping an agenda for the field.One theme that emerges is based on Baumol's ""cost disease"" insight: growth may be constrained not by what we are good at but rather by what is essential and yet hard to improve.",Benjamin Jones; Benjamin T.

Capital Share Dynamics When Firms Insure Workers,"ABSTRACT Although the aggregate capital share of U.S. firms has increased, capital share at the firm‐level has decreased. This divergence is due to mega‐firms that produce a larger output share without a proportionate increase in labor compensation. We develop a model in which firms insure workers against firm‐specific shocks, with more productive firms allocating more rents to shareholders, while less productive firms endogenously exit. Increasing firm‐level risk delays exit and increases the measure of mega‐firms, raising (lowering) the aggregate (average) capital share. An increase in the level of rents magnifies this effect. We present evidence that supports this mechanism.",BARNEY HARTMAN‐GLASER; Barney Hartman‐Glaser; HANNO LUSTIG; Hanno Lustig; MINDY Z. XIAOLAN; Mindy Z.

Declining Responsiveness at the Establishment Level: Sources and Productivity Implications,"This paper studies competing sources of declining dynamism.Evidence shows that an important component of this decline is accounted for by the reduction in the response of employment to shocks in US establishments.Using a plant level dynamic optimization problem as a framework for analysis, four potential reasons for this decline are studied: (i) a change in exogenous processes for profits, (ii) an increase in impatience,(iii) increased market power and (iv) increasing adjustment costs.We identify and quantity the contribution of each of these factors building on a simulated method of moments estimation of our structural model.Our results indicate that the reduction in responsiveness largely reflects increased costs of employment adjustment.Changes in market power, as captured by changes in the curvature of the revenue, function play a minimal role.But, in the presence of rising adjustment costs, measured salesweighted markups using the recently popular indirect production approach rise substantially, along with rising dispersion and skewness of such measured markups.",John Haltiwanger; Jonathan L.

Misallocation Costs of Digging Deeper into the Central Bank Toolkit,"Central bank large-scale asset purchases, such as the purchase of securities of nonfinancial firms, can induce a misallocation of resources through their heterogeneous effect on firm cost of capital. First, we analytically demonstrate the mechanism in a two-period model. We then evaluate the misallocation of resources induced by corporate security purchases and the associated output losses in a calibrated heterogeneous firm New Keynesian DSGE model. The calibrated model suggests misallocation effects from corporate security purchases can be large enough to make them less effective in increasing output than government bond buys.",David Zeke; Robert J.

"Resource Misallocation in European Firms: The Role of Constraints, Firm Characteristics and Managerial Decisions","Using a new survey, we show that the dispersion of marginal products across firms in the European Union is about twice as large as that in the United States. Reducing it to the US level would increase EU GDP by more than 30 percent. Alternatively, removing barriers between industries and countries would raise EU GDP by at least 25 percent. Firm characteristics, such as demographics, quality of inputs, utilization of resources, and dynamic adjustment of inputs, are predictors of the marginal products of capital and labor.We emphasize that some firm characteristics may reflect compensating differentials rather than constraints and the effect of constraints on the dispersion of marginal products may hence be smaller than has been assumed in the literature. We also show that cross-country differences in the dispersion of marginal products are more due to differences in how the business, institutional and policy environment translates firm characteristics into outcomes than to the differences in firm characteristics per se.",Christoph Weiss; Debora Revoltella; Jan Svejnar; Jan Švejnar; Yuriy Gorodnichenko,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3153365,"Business, Industrial organization, Resource (disambiguation), Resource-based view, Microeconomics, Natural resource economics, Economics, Marketing, Computer science, Competitive advantage, Computer network","European Investment Bank; International Zinc Association; European Union; Center for Economic and Policy Research; University of Ljubljana; University of California, Berkeley; IZA - Institute of Labor Economics; UniCredit (United States); Center for Economic Research and Graduate Education – Economics Institute; National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University","CEPR; University of Ljubljana; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); UniCredit Group; European Union - European Investment Bank; CERGE-EI; School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, NY, USA; University of California, Berkeley - Department of Economics; IZA Institute of Labor Economics; IZA","CEPR; University of Ljubljana; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); UniCredit Group; European Union - European Investment Bank; CERGE-EI; School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, NY, USA; University of California, Berkeley - Department of Economics; IZA Institute of Labor Economics; IZA"

"Automation: Theory, Evidence, and Outlook","This article reviews the literature on automation and its impact on labor markets, wages, factor shares, and productivity. I first introduce the task model and explain why this framework offers a compelling way to think about recent labor market trends and the effects of automation technologies. The task model clarifies that automation technologies operate by substituting capital for labor in a widening range of tasks. This substitution reduces costs, creating a positive productivity effect, but it also reduces employment opportunities for workers displaced from automated tasks, creating a negative displacement effect. I survey the empirical literature and conclude that there is wide qualitative support for the implications of task models and the displacement effects of automation. I conclude by discussing shortcomings of the existing literature and avenues for future research.",Pascual Restrepo,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-economics-090523-113355,"Automation, Productivity, Task (project management), Economics, Industrial organization, Emerging technologies, Empirical evidence, Risk analysis (engineering), Computer science, Marketing, Engineering, Business, Macroeconomics, Management, Artificial intelligence, Mechanical engineering, Philosophy, Epistemology",National Bureau of Economic Research; Boston University,"2National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA; 1Department of Economics, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; email: pascual@bu.edu","2National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA; 1Department of Economics, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; email: pascual@bu.edu"
How the Wealth Was Won: Factor Shares as Market Fundamentals,"Why does the stock market rise and fall?From 1989 to 2017, the real per-capita value of corporate equity increased at a 7.2% annual rate.We estimate that 40% of this increase was attributable to a reallocation of rewards to shareholders in a decelerating economy, primarily at the expense of labor compensation.Economic growth accounted for just 25% of the increase, followed by a lower risk price (21%), and lower interest rates (14%).The period 1952 to 1988 experienced only one third as much growth in market equity, but economic growth accounted for more than 100% of it.",Daniel Greenwald; Martin Lettau; Sydney C.

RETRACTED BY THE AUTHORS: Dividend Taxes and the Allocation of Capital,"This paper investigates the 2013 threefold increase in the French dividend tax rate. Using administrative data covering the universe of firms from 2008 to 2017 and a quasi-experimental setting, we find that firms swiftly cut dividend payments and used this tax-induced increase in liquidity to invest more. Heterogeneity analyses show that firms with high demand and returns on capital responded most while no group of firms cut their investment. Our results reject models in which higher dividend taxes increase the cost of capital and show that the tax-induced increase in liquidity relaxes credit constraints, which can reduce capital misallocation.

"Dynamics of Markups, Concentration, and Product Span","We develop a model with a finite number of multiproduct firms together with a continuum of single-product firms and study the dynamics that arise from product innovation. Consistent with the available evidence, the model predicts rising markups and concentration and a declining labor share. Our dynamics predict the possibility of an inverted-U relationship between labor productivity and product span, for which we provide suggestive evidence. In the optimal allocation, product span and labor productivity are strictly positively related. We also characterize optimal policies for these types of sectors.

Obsolescence of Capital and Investment Spikes,"The prospect of capital obsolescence inhibits investment.Investors thus become more optimistic when the obsolescence of their capital slows down.We propose a model with no fixed costs of investment, and random technological progress that induces obsolescence of capital in place.Spikes occur precisely when technological progress slows down.Moreover, the more variable the progress, the larger are the spikes.Cross-industry data show that where price of capital declines are more variable, investment spikes are larger.",Arthur Fishman; Boyan Jovanovic,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w28017,"Obsolescence, Investment (military), Economics, Capital (architecture), Variable (mathematics), Capital investment, Fixed investment, Monetary economics, Fixed capital, Capital equipment, Capital accumulation, Industrial organization, Capital formation, Business, Financial capital, Finance, Market economy, Human capital, Archaeology, Marketing, Politics, Political science, Law, History, Mathematical analysis, Mathematics",National Bureau of Economic Research; New York University; Ariel University,"New York University Department of Economics 19 W. 4th Street, 6th Floor New York, NY 10012; Department of Economics and Business Admin.

How Do Firms Respond to State Retirement Plan Mandates?,"This paper investigates the effect of state retirement plan mandates on the supply of employersponsored retirement plans (ESRPs) by firms.These policies require employers to either (1) offer ESRPs to workers or (2) facilitate automatic payroll deductions that are deposited into individual retirement accounts (IRAs) established for workers by the state.In this paper, we utilize individual-level data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and firm-level data from Form 5500 filings to examine the effect of these automatic-enrollment IRA (""auto-IRA"") policies on employer decisions to offer, and worker inclusion in, ESRPs.We exploit variation in the timing of implementation across states and firm size categories and estimate that auto-IRA policies increase the probability that an individual works for a firm with an ESRP by roughly 3 percent, and the probability that the individual participates in that ESRP by around 7 percent.These policies also increase the number of ESRP participants at the average firm in our sample by 3-5 percent.",Adam Bloomfield; Jay Philbrick; Kyung Min Lee; Sita Nataraj Slavov; Sita Slavov,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w31398,"Plan (archaeology), State (computer science), Business, Labour economics, Economics, Computer science, Geography, Programming language, Archaeology",World Bank; Brown University; George Mason University; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Schar School of Policy and Government George Mason University 3351 Fairfax Drive, MS 3B1 Arlington, VA 22201; WORKING PAPER 31398; The World Bank 1818 H St., NW Washington, DC 20433; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Brown University 69 Brown St., Mail# 7657 Providence, RI 02912; 550 17th St NW Washington, DC 20429","Schar School of Policy and Government George Mason University 3351 Fairfax Drive, MS 3B1 Arlington, VA 22201; WORKING PAPER 31398; The World Bank 1818 H St., NW Washington, DC 20433; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Brown University 69 Brown St., Mail# 7657 Providence, RI 02912; 550 17th St NW Washington, DC 20429"
The Affordable Care Act After a Decade: Industrial Organization of the Insurance Exchanges,"The regulated insurance exchanges set up in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) were designed to deliver affordable, efficient health coverage through private insurers. It is crucial to study the complex industrial organization (IO) of these exchanges in order to assess their impacts during the first decade of the ACA and to project their effects going forward. We revisit the inherent market failures in health care markets that necessitate key ACA exchange regulations and investigate whether they have succeeded in their goals of expanding coverage, creating robust marketplaces, providing product variety, and generating innovation in health care delivery. We discuss empirical IO research to date and also highlight shortcomings in the existing research that can be addressed moving forward. We conclude with a discussion of IO research-based policy lessons for the ACA exchanges and, more generally, for managed competition of private insurance in health care.",Benjamin Handel; Jonathan Kolstad,,,,,,,,,,,,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-economics-051420-114714,"Business, Health insurance, Variety (cybernetics), Health care, Competition (biology), Order (exchange), Product (mathematics), Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public economics, Industrial organization, Actuarial science, Finance, Economics, Economic growth, Computer science, Ecology, Geometry, Mathematics, Artificial intelligence, Biology","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Berkeley","National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA; Department of Economics, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA;,","National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA; Department of Economics, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA;,"
The Impact of Obamacare on Firm Employment and Performance,"This paper studies how mandating employers to provide health insurance of a minimum quality and the associated increases in health insurance premia affect firm employment and performance. Using hand-collected firm-level employee health insurance data around the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), we show that the PPACA is associated with a significant increase in health insurance premia for employees in company-sponsored health insurance plans. In response, employers with greater exposure to the PPACA reduce enrollments in their health insurance plans to a larger extent after the law was enacted. We also find evidence that employers achieve this reduction in enrollment by shifting employment composition from full-time employees to part-time, temporary, or seasonal workers, who are not covered in employer-sponsored health insurance plans. We do not find any evidence of deterioration in performance at companies that were more exposed to the increase in health insurance premia, perhaps because these companies adjust to the new regulation by changing the composition of employment towards part-time employees.",Heitor Almeida; Ping Liu; Ruidi Huang; Yuhai Xuan,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3073378,"Business, Labour economics, Economics, Industrial organization","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Irvine; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Southern Methodist University","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); University of California, Irvine - Paul Merage School of Business; Southern Methodist University (SMU) - Finance Department; Krannert School of Management, Purdue University","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); University of California, Irvine - Paul Merage School of Business; Southern Methodist University (SMU) - Finance Department; Krannert School of Management, Purdue University"
"Optimal Spatial Policies, Geography, and Sorting*","Abstract We study optimal spatial policies in a quantitative trade and geography framework with spillovers and spatial sorting of heterogeneous workers. We characterize the spatial transfers that must hold in efficient allocations, as well as labor subsidies that can implement them. There exists scope for welfare-enhancing spatial policies even when spillovers are common across locations. Using data on U.S. cities and existing estimates of the spillover elasticities, we find that the U.S. economy would benefit from a reallocation of workers to currently low-wage cities. The optimal allocation features a greater share of high-skill workers in smaller cities relative to the observed allocation. Inefficient sorting may lead to substantial welfare costs.",Cecile Gaubert; Cécile Gaubert; Pablo D Fajgelbaum; Pablo Fajgelbaum,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjaa001,"Subsidy, Spillover effect, Sorting, Spatial mismatch, Economics, Welfare, Scope (computer science), Wage, Economies of agglomeration, Economic geography, Labour economics, Microeconomics, Computer science, Market economy, Programming language","National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Berkeley; University of California, Los Angeles","University of California, Los Angeles, and National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Berkeley, National Bureau of Economic Research, and Centre for Economic Policy and Research","University of California, Los Angeles, and National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California, Berkeley, National Bureau of Economic Research, and Centre for Economic Policy and Research"
Economic Growth and Subjective Well-Being: Reassessing the Easterlin Paradox,"The ""Easterlin paradox"" suggests that there is no link between a society's economic development and its average level of happiness.We re-assess this paradox analyzing multiple rich datasets spanning many decades.Using recent data on a broader array of countries, we establish a clear positive link between average levels of subjective well-being and GDP per capita across countries, and find no evidence of a satiation point beyond which wealthier countries have no further increases in subjective well-being.We show that the estimated relationship is consistent across many datasets and is similar to the relationship between subject well-being and income observed within countries.Finally, examining the relationship between changes in subjective well-being and income over time within countries we find economic growth associated with rising happiness.Together these findings indicate a clear role for absolute income and a more limited role for relative income comparisons in determining happiness.",Betsey Stevenson; Justin Wolfers,,,,,,,,,,,,2008.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w14282,"Economics, Economic model, Psychology, Positive economics, Microeconomics",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Pennsylvania,"The Wharton School University of Pennsylvania 1454 Steinberg -Dietrich Hall 3620 Locust Walk Philadelphia, PA 19104; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Business and Public Policy Department Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania 3620 Locust Walk Room 1456 Steinberg-Deitrich Hall Philadelphia, PA 19104-6372","The Wharton School University of Pennsylvania 1454 Steinberg -Dietrich Hall 3620 Locust Walk Philadelphia, PA 19104; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Business and Public Policy Department Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania 3620 Locust Walk Room 1456 Steinberg-Deitrich Hall Philadelphia, PA 19104-6372"
"Opinion Paper: “So what if ChatGPT wrote it?” Multidisciplinary perspectives on opportunities, challenges and implications of generative conversational AI for research, practice and policy","Transformative artificially intelligent tools, such as ChatGPT, designed to generate sophisticated text indistinguishable from that produced by a human, are applicable across a wide range of contexts. The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT's capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT's use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.",Abbas Mardani; Abdullah M.

Can Public Policy Increase Paternity Acknowledgment? Evidence from Earnings-Related Parental Leave,"A child's family structure is a fundamental determinant of future well-being, making it essential to understand how public policies affect the involvement of fathers. In this paper, we exploit a reform of the German parental leave system - which increased mother's income and reduced legal father's financial support burden - to measure the impact on the relationship contract choices of parents who were unmarried at conception. Based on detailed birth record data, we demonstrate that short-run reform incentives during the first period after birth nudge unmarried fathers into the long-term commitment of acknowledging paternity. This shift reduces single motherhood by 6% but leaves the share of marriages at birth constant. Moreover, the change in relationship contract choices is mostly driven by parents of boys. These findings are compatible with predictions from a model where parents choose between three types of relationship contracts based on the mother's and father's incomes and support obligations. Our results highlight the necessity of studying intermediate relationship contracts (i.e., between the extremes of marriage and single motherhood) to improve our understanding of potential risk groups among the rising number of children growing up outside of marriage.",Andrea Weber; Anna Raute; Galina Zudenkova,,,,,,,,,,,,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4046189,"Parental leave, Earnings, Demographic economics, Business, Labour economics, Economics, Accounting, Work (physics), Engineering, Mechanical engineering",Queen Mary University of London; Central European University; TU Dortmund University; Centre for Economic Policy Research,Queen Mary University of London; TU Dortmund University; Central European University (CEU); Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR),Queen Mary University of London; TU Dortmund University; Central European University (CEU); Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR)
The Impacts of Neighborhoods on Intergenerational Mobility I: Childhood Exposure Effects*,"We show that the neighborhoods in which children grow up shape their earnings, college attendance rates, and fertility and marriage patterns by studying more than 7 million families who move across commuting zones and counties in the United States. Exploiting variation in the age of children when families move, we find that neighborhoods have significant childhood exposure effects: the outcomes of children whose families move to a better neighborhood—as measured by the outcomes of children already living there—improve linearly in proportion to the amount of time they spend growing up in that area, at a rate of approximately 4% per year of exposure. We distinguish the causal effects of neighborhoods from confounding factors by comparing the outcomes of siblings within families, studying moves triggered by displacement shocks, and exploiting sharp variation in predicted place effects across birth cohorts, genders, and quantiles to implement overidentification tests. The findings show that neighborhoods affect intergenerational mobility primarily through childhood exposure, helping reconcile conflicting results in the prior literature.",Nathaniel Hendren; Raj Chetty,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjy007,"Demography, Affect (linguistics), Attendance, Variation (astronomy), Fertility, Confounding, Earnings, Psychology, Geography, Demographic economics, Medicine, Economics, Sociology, Population, Economic growth, Physics, Accounting, Communication, Pathology, Astrophysics",National Bureau of Economic Research; Stanford University; Harvard University,Stanford University and National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University and National Bureau of Economic Research,Stanford University and National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University and National Bureau of Economic Research
The Opportunity Atlas: Mapping the Childhood Roots of Social Mobility,"We construct a publicly available atlas of children's outcomes in adulthood by Census tract using anonymized longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population.For each tract, we estimate children's earnings distributions, incarceration rates, and other outcomes in adulthood by parental income, race, and gender.These estimates allow us to trace the roots of outcomes such as poverty and incarceration back to the neighborhoods in which children grew up.We find that children's outcomes vary sharply across nearby areas: for children of parents at the 25th percentile of the income distribution, the standard deviation of mean household income at age 35 is $5,000 across tracts within counties.We illustrate how these tract-level data can provide insight into how neighborhoods shape the development of human capital and support local economic policy using two applications.First, the estimates permit precise targeting of policies to improve economic opportunity by uncovering specific neighborhoods where certain subgroups of children grow up to have poor outcomes.Neighborhoods matter at a very granular level: conditional on characteristics such as poverty rates in a child's own Census tract, characteristics of tracts that are one mile away have little predictive power for a child's outcomes.Our historical estimates are informative predictors of outcomes even for children growing up today because neighborhood conditions are relatively stable over time.Second, we show that the observational estimates are highly predictive of neighborhoods' causal effects, based on a comparison to data from the Moving to Opportunity experiment and a quasi-experimental research design analyzing movers' outcomes.We then identify high-opportunity neighborhoods that are affordable to lowincome families, providing an input into the design of affordable housing policies.Our measures of children's long-term outcomes are only weakly correlated with traditional proxies for local economic success such as rates of job growth, showing that the conditions that create greater upward mobility are not necessarily the same as those that lead to productive labor markets.",John Friedman; John N.

Family Disadvantage and the Gender Gap in Behavioral and Educational Outcomes,"Boys born to disadvantaged families have higher rates of disciplinary problems, lower achievement scores, and fewer high school completions than girls from comparable backgrounds. Using birth certificates matched to schooling records for Florida children born 1992–2002, we find that family disadvantage disproportionately impedes the pre-market development of boys. The differential effect of family disadvantage on boys is robust to specifications within schools and neighborhoods as well as across siblings within families. Evidence supports that this is the effect of the postnatal environment; family disadvantage is unrelated to the gender gap in neonatal health. We conclude that the gender gap among black children is larger than among white children in substantial part because black children are raised in more disadvantaged families.

Place-Based Drivers of Mortality: Evidence from Migration,"We estimate the effect of current location on elderly mortality by analyzing outcomes of movers in the Medicare population. We control for movers' origin locations as well as a rich vector of pre-move health measures. We also develop a novel strategy to adjust for remaining unobservables, using the correlation of residual mortality with movers' origins to gauge the importance of omitted variables. We estimate substantial effects of current location.

Creating Moves to Opportunity: Experimental Evidence on Barriers to Neighborhood Choice,"Low-income families in the United States tend to live in neighborhoods that offer limited opportunities for upward income mobility.One potential explanation for this pattern is that families prefer such neighborhoods for other reasons, such as affordability or proximity to family and jobs.An alternative explanation is that they do not move to high-opportunity areas because of a lack of information or barriers that prevent them from making such moves.We test between these explanations using a two-phase randomized controlled trial with housing voucher recipients in Seattle and King County.We first provided a bundle of resources to facilitate moves to highupward-mobility neighborhoods: information about high-opportunity areas, short-term financial assistance, customized assistance during the housing search process, and connections to landlords.This bundled intervention increased the fraction of families who moved to highupward-mobility areas from 15% in the control group to 53% in the treatment group.To understand the mechanisms underlying this effect, we ran a second phase with three arms:(1) information about high-opportunity areas and financial assistance only; (2) reduced support services in addition to information and financial assistance; and (3) full support services, as in the original bundled intervention.The full services had five times as large a treatment effect as the information and financial incentives treatment and three times as large an effect as the reduced support intervention, showing that high-intensity, customized support enables moves to opportunity.Interviews with randomly selected families reveal that the program succeeded by relaxing families' bandwidth constraints and addressing their specific needs, from identifying suitable units to providing emotional support to brokering with landlords.Families induced to move to higher opportunity areas tend to stay in their new neighborhoods in subsequent years and report higher levels of neighborhood satisfaction after moving.Our findings imply that many low-income families do not have a strong preference to stay in low-opportunity areas and that barriers in the housing search process are a central driver of residential segregation by income.",Christopher Palmer; Lawrence Katz; Nathaniel Hendren; Peter Bergman; Raj Chetty; Stefanie DeLuca,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w26164,"Economic geography, Business, Computer science, Economics",Harvard University; Johns Hopkins University; Harvard University Press; National Bureau of Economic Research; The University of Texas at Austin,"Department of Economics University of Texas at Austin 116 Inner Campus Drive Austin, TX 78712 and; Harvard University Department of Economics Littauer Center Room 235 Cambridge, MA 02138; NBER Working Paper No. 26164; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Johns Hopkins University Department of Sociology; MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main Street, E62-639 Cambridge, MA 02142; Department of Economics Harvard University Cambridge, MA 02138 and NBER; Department of Economics Harvard University Littauer 321 Cambridge, MA 02138","Department of Economics University of Texas at Austin 116 Inner Campus Drive Austin, TX 78712 and; Harvard University Department of Economics Littauer Center Room 235 Cambridge, MA 02138; NBER Working Paper No. 26164; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Johns Hopkins University Department of Sociology; MIT Sloan School of Management 100 Main Street, E62-639 Cambridge, MA 02142; Department of Economics Harvard University Cambridge, MA 02138 and NBER; Department of Economics Harvard University Littauer 321 Cambridge, MA 02138"
"Crafting Intellectual Property Rights: Implications for Patent Assertion Entities, Litigation, and Innovation","We show that examiner-driven variation in patent rights leads to quantitatively large impacts on several patent outcomes, including patent value, citations, and litigation. Notably, Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) overwhelmingly purchase patents granted by “lenient” examiners. These examiners issue patents that are more likely to be litigated by both PAEs and conventional companies, and that also have higher invalidity rates. PAEs leverage a specific friction in the patent system that stems from lenient examiners and affects litigation more broadly. These patterns indicate that there is much at stake during patent examination, contradicting the influential “rational ignorance” view of the patent office.

The Effect of Carbon Pricing on Firm Emissions: Evidence from the Swedish CO2 Tax,"Abstract Sweden was one of the first countries to introduce a carbon tax back in 1991. We assemble a unique data set tracking CO2 emissions from Swedish manufacturing firms over 26 years to estimate the impact of carbon pricing on firm-level emission intensities. We estimate an emission-to-pricing elasticity of around two, with substantial heterogeneity across subsectors and firms, where higher abatement costs and tighter financial constraints are associated with lower elasticities. A simple calibration suggests that 2015 CO2 emissions from Swedish manufacturing would have been roughly 30% higher without carbon pricing.",Christian Thomann; Gustav Martinsson; László Sajtos; Per Strömberg,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhad097,"Economics, Carbon tax, Greenhouse gas, Carbon fibers, Econometrics, Elasticity (physics), Monetary economics, Ecology, Materials science, Composite number, Composite material, Biology",National Institute of Economic Research; Stockholm School of Economics; KTH Royal Institute of Technology; Stockholm University,"Royal Institute of Technology, SHoF, and MISUM , Sweden; Stockholm University, SHoF, and MISUM , Sweden; Konjunkturinstitutet and SHoF , Sweden; Stockholm School of Economics, CEPR, ECGI, SHoF, and MISUM , Sweden","Royal Institute of Technology, SHoF, and MISUM , Sweden; Stockholm University, SHoF, and MISUM , Sweden; Konjunkturinstitutet and SHoF , Sweden; Stockholm School of Economics, CEPR, ECGI, SHoF, and MISUM , Sweden"
Is the Green Transition Inflationary?,"We develop a two-sector New Keynesian model to analyze the inflationary effects of climate policies. Climate policies do not force a central bank to tolerate higher inflation, but may generate a tradeoff between the central bank's objectives for inflation and real activity. The presence and size of this tradeoff depends on how flexible prices are in the ""dirty"" and ""green"" sectors relative to the rest of the economy, and on whether climate policies consist of taxes or subsidies.",Julian di Giovanni; Keshav Dogra; Marco Del Negro,,,,,,,,,,,,2023.0,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4359216,"Transition (genetics), Keynesian economics, Economics, Chemistry, Biochemistry, Gene",Centre for Economic Policy Research; Federal Reserve Bank of New York,Federal Reserve Banks - Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR); Federal Reserve Bank of New York,Federal Reserve Banks - Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR); Federal Reserve Bank of New York
Protecting local water quality has global benefits,"Abstract Surface water is among Earth’s most important resources. Yet, benefit–cost studies often report that the costs of water quality protection exceed its benefits. One possible reason for this seeming paradox is that often only a narrow range of local water quality benefits are considered. In particular, the climate damages from water pollution have rarely been quantified. Recent advances in global water science allow the computation of the global methane emission from lakes caused by human nutrient enrichment (eutrophication). Here, we estimate the present value of the global social cost of eutrophication-driven methane emissions from lakes between 2015 and 2050 to be $7.5–$81 trillion (2015 $US), and in a case-study for one well-studied lake (Lake Erie) we find the global value of avoiding eutrophication exceeds local values of either beach use or sport fishing by 10-fold.",John A.

Large-sample evidence on the impact of unconventional oil and gas development on surface waters,"The impact of unconventional oil and gas development on water quality is a major environmental concern. We built a large geocoded database that combines surface water measurements with horizontally drilled wells stimulated by hydraulic fracturing (HF) for several shales to examine whether temporal and spatial well variation is associated with anomalous salt concentrations in United States watersheds. We analyzed four ions that could indicate water impact from unconventional development. We found very small concentration increases associated with new HF wells for barium, chloride, and strontium but not bromide. All ions showed larger, but still small-in-magnitude, increases 91 to 180 days after well spudding. Our estimates were most pronounced for wells with larger amounts of produced water, wells located over high-salinity formations, and wells closer and likely upstream from water monitors.",Christian Leuz; Giovanna Michelon; Pietro Bonetti,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaz2185,"Hydraulic fracturing, Unconventional oil, Contamination, Surface water, Fossil fuel, Environmental science, Geology, Petroleum engineering, Hydrology (agriculture), Chemistry, Environmental engineering, Geotechnical engineering, Ecology, Organic chemistry, Biology",National Bureau of Economic Research; Universidad de Navarra; University of Bristol; University of Chicago,"IESE Business School, University of Navarra, 21 Avenida Pearson, 08034 Barcelona, Spain.; Booth School of Business, University of Chicago, and the National Bureau of Economic Research, 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.; School of Accounting and Finance, University of Bristol, 15-19 Tyndall's Park Road, Bristol BS8 1PQ, UK.","IESE Business School, University of Navarra, 21 Avenida Pearson, 08034 Barcelona, Spain.; Booth School of Business, University of Chicago, and the National Bureau of Economic Research, 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.; School of Accounting and Finance, University of Bristol, 15-19 Tyndall's Park Road, Bristol BS8 1PQ, UK."

Reclassification Risk in the Small Group Health Insurance Market,"We evaluate reclassification risk in the small group health insurance market from a period before ACA community rating regulations.Reclassification risk in this setting is of key policy relevance and also a matter of debate.We use detailed claims and premiums data from a large insurance company and control non-parametrically for selection.We find a pass through of 16% from changes in health risk to changes in premiums, with a stronger equilibrium relationship between premiums and risk.This pattern is consistent with the insurer implicitly offering ""guaranteed renewability"" contracts with one-sided pricing commitment.We further find that groups whose health risk decreases have premiums that are more responsive to risk, which the guaranteed renewability model attributes to ex post renegotiation.The observed pricing policy adds 60% of the consumer welfare gain from community rating relative to experience rating.The welfare gains are limited because employers and employees switch coverage frequently.",Anthony Lo Sasso; Gautam Gowrisankaran; Sebastián Fleitas,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w24663,"Group (periodic table), Actuarial science, Business, Health insurance, Economics, Health care, Chemistry, Economic growth, Organic chemistry",University of Arizona; DePaul University; Jackson Memorial Hospital; National Bureau of Economic Research; HEC Montréal,"Department of Economics University of Arizona P.O.

Essays in Urban Transportation and Factor Misallocation,"Author(s): Zarate Vasquez, Roman David | Advisor(s): Rodriguez-Clare, Andres | Abstract: This dissertation studies the effect of different policy interventions on allocative efficiency in developing countries. It evaluates how urban and antitrust policies may generate a better allocation of resources across firms, increasing aggregate welfare, and productivity. To provide causal evidence, it collects rich microdata at a very high granular level and exploits plausibly exogenous variation of the main mechanisms. It complements the main empirical findings with quantitative general equilibrium models that allow simulating the effect of different policy interventions.One of the main factors that explain factor misallocation in developing countries is the informal sector. The fact that firms face different tax schedules generate differences in marginal products of labor. The first chapter of my dissertation proposes a new mechanism to account for the significant presence of the informal economy in developing countries: the high commuting costs to transit within cities. I provide evidence of three different empirical facts that align with this hypothesis. First, due to the high commuting costs, most workers in Mexico City have poor access to formal employment. Second, workers that operate in the informal economy are more sensitive to commuting costs, which implies that it is easier to substitute informal jobs. Third, I exploit the construction of line B of the subway in Mexico City to provide causal evidence of the negative relationship between informality and transit improvements. I estimate a series of difference-in-differences specifications, finding that transit improvements lead to a reduction in informality rates by four percentage points in nearby areas to the new stations relative to other places in Mexico City. This result indicates that workers reallocate to firms with higher total factor revenue productivity, increasing the welfare effects of transit improvements relative to the estimates from previous literature.A fundamental question for economists and policymakers is to measure the welfare effects of transit infrastructure that reduce transit times within a city. While the literature has estimated the `direct'' effects of these projects, there are substantial ``indirect'' effects that previous work has ignored. The second chapter develops a spatial general equilibrium model to account for the ``direct'' effects and also for the effects driven by the reallocation of workers from the informal into the formal economy. I extend recent theoretical work in the urban literature by adding distortions that generate resource misallocation. From a first-order approximation, I provide a formula that decomposes the welfare effects of trade and commuting shocks into a ``pure'' effect term and an allocative efficiency margin. I estimate the main elasticities of the model exploiting variation from transit shocks. With these parameters at hand, I simulate different counterfactual interventions. The main findings suggest that line B of the subway increased welfare between 1.3\% and 1.6\%, that the indirect effects explain approximately 15-25\% of the total gains, and that the average real income per every dollar spent on infrastructure increases by 15\% relative to a perfectly efficient economy. In addition to the informal sector, there can be other sources of resource misallocation in developing countries. The third chapter, co-authored with Dario Tortarolo, focuses on the role of market power in explaining differences in marginal products of labor across plants. We disentangle the extent of imperfect competition in product and labor markets, assuming cost-minimizing firms that face upward-sloping labor supply and downward-sloping product demand curves. In the first part, we derive a formula for the ratio between markups and markdowns. We compute this ratio by estimating the output elasticity with respect to labor and the wage bill share. We disentangle the measure of market power specific to each firm by estimating labor supply elasticities using as an instrument intermediate inputs. Our results suggest that both markets exhibit imperfect competition, but markups mainly drive the variation. We assume a general equilibrium model to measure the relative gains of removing market power dispersion on allocative efficiency. The findings suggest that markups are more critical in explaining TFP than markdowns.",Roman David; Vásquez Zárate; Zarate Vasquez,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,,"Allocative efficiency, Informal sector, Microdata (statistics), Economics, Exploit, Developing country, Productivity, Welfare, Empirical evidence, Aggregate data, Total factor productivity, Public economics, Labour economics, Economic growth, Microeconomics, Population, Market economy, Medicine, Philosophy, Demography, Computer security, Epistemology, Pathology, Sociology, Computer science, Census",,,
The producer benefits of implicit fossil fuel subsidies in the United States,"This paper estimates the financial benefits accruing to fossil fuel producers (i.e., the producer incidence) that arise because of implicit fossil fuel subsidies in the United States. The analysis takes account of coal, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel, along with the implicit subsidies due to externalized environmental damages, public health effects, and transportation-related costs. The direct benefit to fossil fuel producers across all four fuels is estimated at $62 billion per year, a sum calculated due to the higher price that suppliers receive because of inefficient pricing compared to the counterfactual scenario where environmental and public health externalities are internalized. A significant portion of these benefits accrue to relatively few companies, and specific estimates are provided for companies with the largest production. The financial benefit because of unpriced costs borne by society is comparable to 18% of net income from continuing domestic operations for the median natural gas and oil producer in 2017-2018, and it exceeds net income for the majority of coal producers. The results clarify what the domestic fossil fuel industry has at stake financially when it comes to policies that seek to address climate change, adverse health effects from local pollution, and inefficient transportation.",Matthew J.

Climate Policy and the Economy: Evidence from Europe's Carbon Pricing Initiatives,"This paper investigates the impact of carbon pricing on the economy, with a focus on European carbon taxes and the carbon market. Our analysis reveals three key findings. First, while both policies have successfully reduced emissions, the economic costs of the European carbon market are larger than for national carbon taxes. Second, we explore four factors that explain this difference: fiscal policy and revenue recycling, pass-through and sectoral coverage, spillovers and leakage, and monetary policy. Our findings suggest that all four factors play a significant role. Third, we document substantial regional heterogeneity in the impacts of the carbon market, which crucially depend on the share of freely allocated emission permits and the degree of market concentration in the power sector.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",Diego R.

Dynamics of the Gender Gap for Young Professionals in the Financial and Corporate Sectors,"The careers of MBAs from a top US business school are studied to understand how career dynamics differ by gender. Although male and female MBAs have nearly identical earnings at the outset of their careers, their earnings soon diverge, with the male earnings advantage reaching almost 60 log points a decade after MBA completion. Three proximate factors account for the large and rising gender gap in earnings: differences in training prior to MBA graduation, differences in career interruptions, and differences in weekly hours. The greater career discontinuity and shorter work hours for female MBAs are largely associated with motherhood. (JEL J16, J22, J31, J44)",Claudia Goldin; Lawrence F Katz; Lawrence F.

The Missing “Missing Middle”,"Although a large literature seeks to explain the “missing middle” of mid-sized firms in developing countries, there is surprisingly little empirical backing for existence of the missing middle. Using microdata on the full distribution of both formal and informal sector manufacturing firms in India, Indonesia, and Mexico, we document three facts. First, while there are a very large number of small firms, there is no “missing middle” in the sense of a bimodal distribution: mid-sized firms are missing, but large firms are missing too, and the fraction of firms of a given size is smoothly declining in firm size. Second, we show that the distribution of average products of capital and labor is unimodal, and that large firms, not small firms, have higher average products. This is inconsistent with many models explaining “the missing middle” in which small firms with high returns are constrained from expanding. Third, we examine regulatory and tax notches in India, Indonesia, and Mexico of the sort often thought to discourage firm growth and find no economically meaningful bunching of firms near the notch points. We show that existing beliefs about the missing middle are largely due to arbitrary transformations that were made to the data in previous studies.",Benjamin A.

"Offshore Profit Shifting and Aggregate Measurement: Balance of Payments, Foreign Investment, Productivity, and the Labor Share","We show how offshore profit shifting by US multinational enterprises affects several key measures of the US economy. Profits shifted out of the United States grew rapidly from the mid-1990s to 2010 and have since waned. From 1982–2016, on average, 38 percent of income attributed to US direct investment abroad is reattributable to the United States. We find that adjusting for profit shifting shrinks the trade deficit, decreases the return on US foreign direct investment abroad, boosts productivity growth rates in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and lowers labor’s share of income.

The Rise of Niche Consumption,"Over the last 15 years, individual households have concentrated their spending on a few preferred products. However, this is not driven by “superstar” products capturing larger market shares. Instead, households increasingly purchase different products from each other. As a result, aggregate spending concentration has decreased. We develop a model of heterogeneous household demand and use it to conclude that increasing product variety drives these divergent trends. When more products are available, households select products better matched to their tastes.

"Not a Typical Firm: The Joint Dynamics of Firms, Labor Shares, and Capital–Labor Substitution","While the US labor share has declined, especially in manufacturing and retail, the labor share of a typical firm in these sectors has risen.This paper introduces a model where firms incur fixed costs to automate tasks.In response to lower capital prices, the model reproduces the labor share patterns observed in the data: large firms automate more tasks, reducing the aggregate labor share; while the median firm continues to operate a labor-intensive technology with a rising labor share.Using our model, we decompose the labor share decline and the rise in sales concentration in each sector into a part driven by lower capital prices and a part driven by reallocation to higher-markup firms.Reallocation played a minor role in explaining the labor share decline in manufacturing and some role in retail and other sectors during 1982-2012.",Joachim Hubmer; Pascual Restrepo,,,,,,,,,,,,2021.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w28579,"Substitution (logic), Labour economics, Capital (architecture), Economics, Joint (building), Labor relations, Dynamics (music), Business, Engineering, Computer science, Geography, Architectural engineering, Archaeology, Programming language, Physics, Acoustics",Cornell University; Boston University; Bank of Mexico; University of Pennsylvania; Dartmouth Hospital; Bay State College; National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University,"University of Pennsylvania 133 S 36th St Philadelphia, PA 19104; Fed Richmond, Glasgow, IIES, IMF,; Cornell, Dartmouth, Edinburgh, Essex,; Columbia University Junior Conference, Copenhagen,; Department of Economics Boston University 270 Bay State Road Boston, MA 02215; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; MMF Workshop on Macroeconomic Consequences of Technical Change, NBER Summer Institute, Oslo Macro Conference, Peking University, Philadelphia Fed,; conference and seminar participants at Bank of Mexico, Barcelona GSE Summer Forum, Boston College,; SED Minneapolis, Toronto,","University of Pennsylvania 133 S 36th St Philadelphia, PA 19104; Fed Richmond, Glasgow, IIES, IMF,; Cornell, Dartmouth, Edinburgh, Essex,; Columbia University Junior Conference, Copenhagen,; Department of Economics Boston University 270 Bay State Road Boston, MA 02215; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; MMF Workshop on Macroeconomic Consequences of Technical Change, NBER Summer Institute, Oslo Macro Conference, Peking University, Philadelphia Fed,; conference and seminar participants at Bank of Mexico, Barcelona GSE Summer Forum, Boston College,; SED Minneapolis, Toronto,"
Misallocation Under Trade Liberalization,"This paper formalises a classic idea that in second-best environments trade can induce welfare losses: gains accrued can be outweighed by incremental income losses stemming from distortions.In a Melitz model with distortionary taxes, we derive sufficient statistics for welfare gains from trade, and show that its departure from the efficient case (ACR) can be captured by the gap between an input and output share and domestic extensive margin elasticities.The loss reflects the impact of an endogenous selection of more subsidized firms into exporting.We show sufficient conditions under which conventional formulas overestimate trade gains as well as conditions under which welfare losses can occur.Using Chinese manufacturing data, we demonstrate by taking into account firm-level distortions, welfare losses largely offset conventional gains to trade.",Dan Lu; Keyu Jin; Yan Bai,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w26188,"Economics, International economics, International trade, Liberalization, Free trade, Business, Market economy",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Rochester; London School of Economics and Political Science,"NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of Rochester 216 Harkness Hall Rochester, NY 14627 and; London School of Economics","NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH 1050 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138; Department of Economics University of Rochester 216 Harkness Hall Rochester, NY 14627 and; London School of Economics"
Dispersion in Dispersion: Measuring Establishment‐Level Differences in Productivity,"Abstract We describe new experimental productivity dispersion statistics, Dispersion Statistics on Productivity (DiSP), jointly produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Census Bureau, that complement the official BLS industry‐level productivity statistics. The BLS has a long history of producing industry‐level productivity statistics, which represent the average establishment‐level productivity within industries when appropriately weighted. These statistics cannot, however, tell us about the variation in productivity levels across establishments within those industries. Dispersion in productivity across businesses can provide information about the nature of competition and frictions within sectors and the sources of rising wage inequality across businesses. DiSP data show enormous differences in productivity across establishments within industries in the manufacturing sector. We find substantial variation in dispersion across industries, increasing dispersion from 1997 to 2016, and countercyclical total factor productivity dispersion. We hope DiSP will enable further research into understanding productivity differences across industries and establishments and over time.",Cheryl Grim; Cindy Cunningham; Jay Stewart; John Haltiwanger; Lucia Foster; Sabrina Wulff Pabilonia; Zoltan Wolf; Zoltán Wolf,,,,,,,,,,,,2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/roiw.12616,"Productivity, Dispersion (optics), Economics, Competition (biology), Multifactor productivity, Econometrics, Wage dispersion, Labour economics, Total factor productivity, Agricultural economics, Wage, Macroeconomics, Efficiency wage, Ecology, Physics, Biology, Optics",United States Census Bureau; Bureau of Labor Statistics; New Light Industries (United States),"New Light Technologies; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and IZA; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics; Center for Economic Studies, U.S. Census Bureau; University of Maryland, NBER, and IZA","New Light Technologies; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and IZA; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics; Center for Economic Studies, U.S. Census Bureau; University of Maryland, NBER, and IZA"
"Technological Synergies, Heterogeneous Firms, and Idiosyncratic Volatility","This paper shows the importance of technological synergies among heterogeneous firms for aggregate fluctuations.First, we document six novel empirical facts using microdata that suggest the existence of important technological synergies between trading firms, the presence of positive assortative matching among firms, and their evolution during the business cycle.Next, we embed technological synergies in a general equilibrium model calibrated on firm-level data.We show that frictions in forming trading relationships and separation costs explain imperfect sorting between firms in equilibrium.In particular, an increase in the volatility of idiosyncratic productivity shocks significantly decreases aggregate output without resorting to non-convex adjustment costs.",Francesco Zanetti; Jesús Fernández-Villaverde; Jesús Fernández‐Villaverde; Yang Yu,,,,,,,,,,,,2024.0,https://doi.org/10.3386/w32247,"Volatility (finance), Business, Economics, Financial economics, Industrial organization",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Center for Economic and Policy Research; University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Oxford,"University of Oxford Department of Economics and CEPR; The Ronald O.
