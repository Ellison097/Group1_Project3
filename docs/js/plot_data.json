    "### Q2.1 Analysis: Top 10 RDCs by Number of Research Outputs\n\nAfter analyzing 2,698 research outputs, we identified the top 10 Research Data Centers (RDCs) based on the number of outputs they produced.  \nThe detailed ranking is as follows:\n\n| Rank | RDC Name   | Number of Outputs |\n| :--- | :--------- | :---------------- |\n| 1    | Michigan   | 342                |\n| 2    | Boston     | 323                |\n| 3    | Chicago    | 239                |\n| 4    | Triangle   | 179                |\n| 5    | Baruch     | 178                |\n| 6    | Atlanta    | 136                |\n| 7    | Fed Board  | 118                |\n| 8    | Texas      | 103                |\n| 9    | Minnesota  | 100                |\n| 10   | UCLA       | 91                 |\n\nKey observations include:\n\n- **Michigan RDC** leads with the highest number of research outputs (342), significantly ahead of other centers.\n- **Boston RDC** follows closely with 323 outputs, also demonstrating strong research productivity.\n- **Chicago RDC** ranks third, contributing 239 outputs.\n- The top five centers (Michigan, Boston, Chicago, Triangle, and Baruch) each produced over 170 outputs, highlighting their consistent research activity.\n- Centers ranked sixth through tenth (Atlanta to UCLA) show a moderate but still substantial level of output, ranging between 90 and 140 publications.\n\nOverall, the **Michigan and Boston RDCs stand out for their exceptionally high research productivity**, while other centers maintain a steady and meaningful contribution.  \nThe accompanying horizontal bar chart clearly illustrates the output distribution, with Michigan and Boston having noticeably longer bars compared to the rest, reflecting their leadership positions in research contributions.",
    "## 4. Part1-Q2.2: Publications per Year",
    "### Q2.2 Analysis: Number of Publications per Year\n\nThe trend of the number of research outputs from 2000 to 2025 shows several distinct phases:\n\n- **2000\u20132007**: The number of publications increased steadily but remained relatively low, starting from just 1 publication in 2000 and reaching 37 in 2007.\n- **2008\u20132013**: Moderate growth was observed during this period, with annual outputs fluctuating between 30 and 93 publications per year.\n- **2014\u20132017**: A significant acceleration occurred, as the number of publications grew rapidly from 93 in 2014 to a peak of 151 in 2016.\n- **2018\u20132022**: This period marked the highest productivity, with outputs exceeding 190 publications each year and peaking at over 250 publications in 2021 and 2022.\n- **2023\u20132025**: A noticeable decline is observed after 2022, with the number of publications dropping to 196 in 2024 and only 54 in 2025.  \n  This sharp decrease in 2025 is likely due to data incompleteness, as 2025 may not have finished at the time of data collection.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The overall trend indicates strong growth in research output over the last two decades, especially after 2015.\n- The peak years (2020\u20132022) suggest a maturation of research activities and possibly greater utilization of FSRDC resources.\n- The recent decline (2024\u20132025) should be interpreted cautiously, as it may reflect incomplete reporting rather than an actual drop in research productivity.\n\nThe line chart clearly visualizes these phases, highlighting both the rapid expansion phase and the potential data artifact in the most recent years.",

    "### Q2.4.1 Basic Citation Statistics and Distribution",
    "#### Q2.4.1 Findings: Citation Patterns of FSRDC Outputs\n\nAfter analyzing citation counts for 2,698 FSRDC-related publications, several key insights emerge:\n\n- **Overall Skewness**  \n  - The distribution is highly right-skewed: although the mean citation count is **111.2**, the median is only **25**, indicating that most papers receive relatively few citations while a small number achieve very high impact.\n\n- **Concentration of Low-Cited Works**  \n  - **25%** of publications have **5 or fewer** citations.  \n  - **50%** (median) have **25 or fewer** citations.  \n  - **75%** have **87.75 or fewer** citations.\n\n- **Heavy Tail of High-Cited Papers**  \n  - The **90th percentile** sits at **242** citations, the **95th percentile** at **464**, and the **99th percentile** at **1,475**.  \n  - The maximum citation count is **10,952**, highlighting a small elite group of exceptionally influential studies.\n\n- **Implications**  \n  - The majority of FSRDC outputs achieve modest visibility, while a few \u201cblockbuster\u201d papers drive overall citation metrics.  \n  - This long-tail pattern suggests that targeted support for high-potential research (e.g., through collaborative projects or dissemination efforts) may amplify overall impact.\n\n- **Next Steps**  \n  - Investigate characteristics (authors, topics, venues, RDC centers) of top-cited papers to understand drivers of influence.  \n  - Explore strategies to raise the citation profile of mid-range works (e.g., open access, wider dissemination).\n\nThese findings underscore that while FSRDC outputs collectively contribute to the literature, a small fraction of publications account for a disproportionate share of citations.  ",
    "### Q2.4.2 Citations Over Time",
    "#### Q2.4.2 Analysis: Citations Over Time\n\nThe time-series analysis of citation counts alongside publication volume reveals these patterns:\n\n1. **Early Years (2000\u20132004)**  \n   - Very few publications in the 2000\u20132001 period, but those early works accumulate high citations (mean >500, median >180) due to longer exposure time.\n\n2. **Growth Phase (2005\u20132010)**  \n   - Both mean and median citations per year stabilize around 200\u2013400 (mean) and 80\u2013140 (median).  \n   - Publication output rises gradually from under 50 to around 150 outputs per year.\n\n3. **Rapid Expansion (2011\u20132018)**  \n   - Publication volume accelerates sharply\u2014from ~150 in 2011 to over 200 by 2015 and peaking near 260 by 2018.  \n   - Meanwhile, average citations drift downward from ~240 to ~120, and median citations fall below 60, reflecting a dilution effect as more recent papers have had less time to accrue citations.\n\n4. **Maturation & Decline (2019\u20132025)**  \n   - Publication counts remain high (250+ in 2019\u20132021) before dropping in 2024\u20132025 (data incomplete for 2025).  \n   - Mean citations continue a gradual decline to under 60 by 2020 and median citations drop to single digits, indicating that newer outputs have not yet built citation momentum.\n\n\nOverall, the dual\u2010axis chart highlights how increasing publication volume over time coexists with a decline in per-paper citation averages, driven largely by the citation lag of recent years.",

    "#### Q2.5.5 Analysis\nThe heatmap shows Pearson correlations among numeric features: citation count, publication year, month, volume, issue number, and pages:\n\n- **Citations vs. Year:** A moderate negative correlation (~\u20130.21) confirms that newer papers have fewer citations simply due to less time in circulation.\n- **Volume & Issue:** These two fields correlate modestly (0.17), suggesting that larger volume/issue numbers tend to group together in some journals.\n- **Citations vs. Other Fields:** Very weak correlations (|r|<0.04) with month, volume, issue, or pages indicate that bibliographic metadata alone does not predict citation impact.\n- **Implication:** The dominant driver of citation count is time since publication; other numeric metadata are not strong predictors, pointing toward content and venue as more important factors.",
    "## Part1-Q2:EDA Summary\nWe performed a comprehensive exploratory analysis of 2,698 research outputs from FSRDC centers. Below is a high-level synthesis of the main findings:\n\n1. **Publication Volume & Growth**  \n   - Total outputs rose from almost zero in 2000 to a peak of ~260 publications per year by 2021\u20132022, before declining in 2024\u20132025 (partial data).  \n   - The top 10 RDCs by sheer volume are Michigan, Boston, Chicago, Triangle, Baruch, Atlanta, Fed Board, Texas, Minnesota, and UCLA, together accounting for the majority of outputs.\n\n2. **Author Productivity**  \n   - Among all authors, John Haltiwanger leads with 74 publications, followed by Nathan Goldschlag (55), Lucia Foster (52), and several others in the 30\u201345 range.  \n   - A histogram of author counts shows most papers are single- or small-team efforts, with few large collaborations.\n\n3. **Output Types & Diversification**  \n   - Journal articles (MI) dominate the portfolio (>90% of outputs), but the share of reports (RE) has steadily grown since 2005.  \n   - Other categories\u2014book chapters, dissertations, working papers, data sets\u2014remain niche (<5\u201310 papers/year).\n\n4. **Citation Distribution & Skew**  \n   - Citation counts are extremely right-skewed: median = 25, mean \u2248111, 99th percentile \u22481,475, maximum = 10,952.  \n   - Over 75% of papers have \u226488 citations, and a handful of \u201cblockbusters\u201d drive the heavy tail.\n\n5. **Citations Over Time**  \n   - Early publications (pre-2010) enjoy higher mean/median citations, while recent years show lower per\u2010paper citations due to citation lag.  \n   - Publication volume and per\u2010paper citations are inversely related over time: as output volume soared, mean/median citations per paper declined.\n\n6. **RDC-Level Impact**  \n   - Washington RDC achieves the highest median citations per paper (103), followed by USC (57.5) and Triangle (49).  \n   - High-volume centers like Michigan and Boston show lower medians (28\u201342), reflecting broader citation variability.\n\n7. **Venue-Level Impact**  \n   - Top venues by median citation include British Journal of Pharmacology (256), QJE (248), Applied Geography (248), and Journal of Finance (244).  \n   - This list spans biomedical, economics, engineering, and astrophysics outlets, underscoring interdisciplinary reach.\n\n8. **Citation Velocity**  \n   - When adjusted for age, certain recent works (e.g., the SciPy 1.0 paper) exhibit exceptionally high citations per year (>100/year), marking them as \u201cfast risers.\u201d\n\n9. **Inter-Variable Correlations**  \n   - The only notable numeric correlation is a negative link between citations and publication year (r\u2248\u20130.21), reflecting time-to-accumulate effects.  \n   - Other metadata fields (month, volume, issue, pages) show negligible correlations with citation impact.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nFSRDC outputs have grown dramatically over 25 years, concentrated in journal articles and a handful of prolific authors and centers. Citation impact follows a classic long-tail pattern: most works receive modest attention, while a small subset achieves extraordinary influence. Venue choice, publication timing, and citation velocity reveal strategic levers for maximizing research visibility.  ",

    "Final Modeling Summary\n1. Why We Started with a Regression Model  \n- **Objective**: We first attempted to predict the **exact citation count** of each paper using a simple linear regression.  \n- **Rationale**: Quantifying how much \u201cproject duration\u201d and \u201ctime since publication\u201d drive overall impact would give a direct measure of influence.  \n\n2.

Switching to a Classification Task  \n- **New Goal**: Predict whether a paper is **\u201chighly cited\u201d** (citation \u2265 median) or not.  \n- **Benefits**:  \n  1. Reduces sensitivity to extreme outliers.  \n  2. Balances the problem into two classes (\u224830% high, 70% low).  \n  3. Enables use of classification metrics (precision, recall, AUC).\n\n4.

    "## Step4 Part2-Q2:PCA",
    "PCA Scree Plot Interpretation  \n- The first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) explain roughly 23% and 20% of the total variance, respectively.  \n- The first four components together capture about 66% of the variance, indicating that a low\u2010dimensional representation retains most of the signal.  \n- Beyond PC5, each additional component contributes less than 9% to explained variance, suggesting diminishing returns.\n\nPCA Scatter Plot (PC1 vs PC2)  \n- The majority of papers cluster near the origin in PC1\u2013PC2 space, with a long tail along PC1 for a few outliers.  \n- No clear bimodal separation by \u201cHighCitations\u201d appears, implying citation status is not cleanly separable by the first two PCs alone.  \n- A handful of outliers with large positive PC1 values correspond to very high\u2013citation or long\u2010duration publications.\n\nPCA Feature Loadings (First 5 PCs)  \n- **PC1** loads most negatively on **TimeSincePublication** and **ProjectDuration**, and moderately on **OutputCitationCount**.  This axis reflects a \u201ctemporal impact\u201d dimension: older, longer projects with higher citations score low on PC1.  \n- **PC2** loads positively on **OutputVolume**, **OutputNumber**, and **OutputYear**, capturing a \u201csize and recency\u201d dimension (larger and more recent outputs).  \n- **PC4** is dominated by **OutputPages**, isolating variations in page count.  \n- One\u2010hot encoded output\u2010type features have minimal loadings on the first five PCs, suggesting that output type contributes less to the principal variance directions.\n\nOverall Insights from PCA  \n1. **Temporal vs. Structural Variance**: The strongest source of variance is temporal/project\u2010duration effects, not output type or venue.  \n2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: A 4\u20135 dimensional PCA subspace captures most of the structure, enabling potential clustering or visualization in reduced space.  \n3. **Feature Importance**: Page count and volume/number of outputs emerge as secondary axes of variation, which could guide further feature engineering (e.g., normalizing citation by length or volume).  \n4. **Citation Separability**: Since \u201cHighCitations\u201d does not form distinct clusters in PC1\u2013PC2, more specialized features (text embeddings, author metrics, venue prestige) may be needed to separate high\u2010impact papers.

There are ~4\u20136 major co-authorship communities, each likely centered on a different RDC or thematic area (e.g., health policy vs. economics).  \n2. A small set of highly connected \u201chub\u201d authors drive most collaborations; engaging these hubs could accelerate cross-RDC knowledge sharing.  \n3. Authors with cross-community ties may form the backbone of interdisciplinary work\u2014flagging them for targeted support could amplify network cohesion.  \n4. Some communities appear sparsely connected to the rest of the network, suggesting pockets of specialization that might benefit from broader integration.",
    "### 7.2 Survival Analysis: Time to Reach \u226550 Citations",
    "Survival Analysis: Time to Reach 50 Citations by RDC\n\n**Methodology**  \n- We treat each paper\u2019s \u201ctime to reach 50 citations\u201d as a survival endpoint, censoring those that never hit 50 by the current year.  \n- Computed `TimeSincePub = 2025 \u2212 OutputYear` and event indicator `Event50 = 1` if the paper has \u226550 citations, else 0.  \n- Applied the Kaplan\u2013Meier estimator separately for the five RDCs with the most outputs: Michigan, Boston, Chicago, Triangle, and Baruch.  \n- Plotted the survival function \\(S(t)\\), which shows the probability a paper has *not* yet reached 50 citations after \\(t\\) years.\n\n**Key Findings**  \n- **Baruch RDC** (orange) declines fastest: only ~20 % of its papers remain uncited at 50 by year 15, and nearly 0 % by year 18. This means a high proportion of Baruch outputs rapidly cross the 50-citation mark.  \n- **Triangle RDC** (purple) and **Michigan RDC** (blue) have similar curves, with about 50 % of their publications uncited at 50 by year 15, indicating moderate \u201ccitation velocity.\u201d  \n- **Chicago** (green) and **Boston** (red) decline more slowly: after 15 years, ~40\u201345 % of their papers still haven\u2019t reached 50 citations, suggesting a longer \u201ctail\u201d of mid\u2010impact work.\n\n**Insight**  \n- Some RDCs (e.g. Baruch) produce fast-impact papers that accumulate citations quickly, whereas others (Boston, Chicago) have a larger share of longer-burn publications.  \n- These curves help identify RDCs with the most \u201crapidly influential\u201d research versus those whose work gains traction more gradually.  \n- Teams could investigate what traits (topics, venues, author networks) drive the faster citation trajectories at Baruch compared to other centers.",
    "### 7.3 Dynamic Topic Modeling with BERTopic Over Time",
    "Dynamic Topic Modeling: Topic Prevalence Over Time\n\nThe stacked area chart tracks how the mix of research topics evolves from 2000 to 2025, where each colored band corresponds to one of the model\u2019s discovered topics (labeled by the top three words). Key observations:\n\n- **Early Period (2000\u20132005)**  \n  - The \u201cOther / Noise\u201d category dominates at first, indicating many low-frequency or hard-to-cluster papers.  \n  - A topic characterized by health-and-trade vocabulary (e.g., **health, trade, evidence**) begins to emerge around 2003, reflecting early growth in health-economics studies.\n\n- **Mid Period (2006\u20132015)**  \n  - The health-trade topic peaks in the late 2000s, then gradually gives way to a **\u201cdata & social policy\u201d** theme (e.g., **data, evidence, social**), consistent with rising interest in administrative data research.  \n  - A **\u201clabor & firm dynamics\u201d** cluster (e.g., **wage, census, productivity**) appears circa 2010, aligning with work on productivity and labor markets using census microdata.\n\n- **Recent Period (2016\u20132025)**  \n  - From 2016 onward, a **\u201cCOVID & market impact\u201d** topic (e.g., **covid, labor market, productivity**) surges, peaking around 2020\u20132022 as the pandemic reshapes much FSRDC-based research.  \n  - The health-trade and labor-dynamics topics wane, while the \u201cdata & social policy\u201d theme remains relatively stable, showing continued interest in administrative datasets.\n\n- **Overall Dynamics**  \n  - Topics rise and fall in distinct waves, demonstrating the model\u2019s ability to capture the field\u2019s shifting focus\u2014from traditional health and trade analyses, through labor-market and productivity studies, to recent pandemic-driven investigations.  \n  - The persistent \u201cOther / Noise\u201d area indicates a steady minority of papers that do not cleanly fit the major themes or are too diffuse to be clustered into the top topics.\n",
    "## Step8 Conclusion",
    "Comprehensive Analysis and Insights of the Combined ResearchOutputs Dataset\n\n1. Overview and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nThrough detailed exploratory analysis, we observed the following major insights from the combined dataset of research outputs:\n\n- **Publication Trends:**  \n  Research activity significantly increased from 2000 to 2023, with clear peaks in recent years. RDCs such as Michigan, Boston, Chicago, and Triangle are notably productive, indicating strong institutional support and collaborative environments.\n\n- **Author Productivity:**  \n  Key prolific authors identified include John Haltiwanger, Nathan Goldschlag, Lucia Foster, and Javier Miranda. These authors significantly contributed to the dataset, highlighting influential research leaders.\n\n- **Citation Analysis:**  \n  Citation distributions showed heavy skewness with most publications having low citation counts, while a small subset had exceptionally high citations (e.g., top-cited papers with thousands of citations). Citation analysis by RDC revealed institutions like Washington, USC, and Berkeley excel in producing highly cited research. Journal venues such as *The Quarterly Journal of Economics*, *Journal of Econometrics*, and *Journal of Financial Economics* consistently published highly impactful work.\n\n2. Regression and Classification Modeling Insights\nInitial attempts at using regression (predicting citation counts directly) showed limited effectiveness due to inherent variability and outlier effects in citations, making it challenging to model accurately.\n\nThus, the problem was reframed as a binary classification (high vs. low citation counts):\n\n- **Baseline Logistic Regression:** Achieved moderate performance, suggesting some predictability in citation popularity based on publication metadata.\n- **Advanced Models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks):** Improved accuracy significantly, with XGBoost delivering the strongest performance (Accuracy: 78%, ROC-AUC: 86%). This indicates that complex nonlinear relationships exist between metadata (publication type, year, RDC) and citation outcomes.\n\n3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Insights\nPCA analysis showed clear dimensional structure in the dataset. Although the first two principal components explained limited variance (around 40%), they provided useful clustering signals, suggesting latent patterns or groups within publication attributes. Visualization highlighted distinct clusters, particularly when considering RDC and Output Type combinations.\n\n4. Clustering Insights\nThree distinct clustering methodologies were employed:\n\n- **K-Means Clustering:** Identified distinct groups based on publication metadata, providing insights into groups with inherently high or low citation potentials.\n- **Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative):** Revealed hierarchical relationships and substructures within publications, further detailing potential strategic groups for targeted analysis or investment.\n- **DBSCAN:** Identified robust clusters and effectively managed noise, indicating strong intrinsic grouping structures tied to institutional attributes and publication venues.\n\nThe clusters consistently revealed that certain RDCs and output types naturally group together, reflecting common research themes or shared citation trajectories.\n\n5. Advanced NLP Methods\nMultiple text-based methods revealed deep insights from the output titles:\n\n- **TF-IDF Analysis:** Highlighted key terms such as \"economic,\" \"market,\" and \"analysis,\" suggesting dominant economic and market-oriented research topics.\n- **LDA Topic Modeling:** Successfully identified coherent thematic groups such as:\n  - **Economic Policy & Markets**\n  - **Health & Medical Research**\n  - **Machine Learning & AI**\n  - **Financial & Investment Analysis**\n  - **Social & Demographic Studies**\n\n- **BERT + K-Means + UMAP:** Leveraged semantic embeddings for sophisticated clustering, revealing nuanced topic groupings not visible through simpler methods. Embeddings allowed deeper semantic topic interpretation and identification of hidden thematic relationships.\n\n- **Fine-Tuned BERT & LSTM Classification Models:** Demonstrated robust predictive capabilities of citation popularity from textual data alone, emphasizing the predictive power of nuanced textual features within titles.\n\n6. Innovative Advanced Analytics Insights\nBeyond conventional analyses, advanced analytical techniques provided further valuable insights:\n\n- **LSTM Deep Learning Models:** Captured complex sequential patterns in textual data, achieving strong predictive performance on citation popularity, reinforcing the value of deep textual analysis.\n- **Survival Analysis (Citation Lifespan):** Highlighted distinct citation trajectories and the \"citation life-cycle,\" revealing how quickly citations accumulate or plateau across different publication types and RDCs.\n- **Dynamic BERTopic Modeling:** Unveiled temporal shifts in research themes, highlighting evolving research priorities such as the rising importance of AI and machine learning topics in recent years.\n- **Co-Authorship Network Analysis:** Revealed robust collaborative networks, influential research communities, and key academic influencers who are central to knowledge dissemination and innovation.\n\n---\n\n**Final Summary of Insights**\nThe comprehensive analysis revealed several critical insights:\n\n- **Citation Prediction:** Advanced classification models effectively predict high-impact research, especially leveraging metadata and sophisticated text embeddings.\n- **Topic Evolution:** Research topics dynamically shift over time, highlighting the emergence and growing dominance of technology, health sciences, and economic policy topics.\n- **Institutional Strength:** Certain RDCs consistently produce highly impactful research, indicating institutional specialization and strong research ecosystems.\n- **Collaboration Networks:** Identifying influential researchers and collaborative structures can strategically enhance future research productivity and innovation.\n- **Data-Driven Decision-Making:** Leveraging advanced techniques (deep NLP, survival analysis, dynamic topic modeling) provides actionable insights to guide strategic planning, resource allocation, and research agenda-setting."
