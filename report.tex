\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Project Overview}
The Group1 Project3 represents a significant undertaking in the field of academic research analytics, specifically focusing on the Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDC) ecosystem. This comprehensive data science project was initiated to address critical questions about research productivity, impact, and patterns within the FSRDC network. By leveraging advanced data processing techniques and sophisticated analytical methods, the project provides unprecedented insights into the dynamics of academic research output and its broader implications.

At its core, the project seeks to understand how research output evolves over time, how different RDCs contribute to the academic landscape, and what factors influence the impact of research publications. The analysis spans a substantial dataset of 2,698 research outputs, covering a 25-year period from 2000 to 2025. This extensive temporal coverage allows for meaningful analysis of trends and patterns in academic research production and impact.

The project's methodology combines traditional statistical analysis with cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We employ a multi-faceted approach that includes data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and advanced text analysis. This comprehensive methodology enables us to extract meaningful insights from various aspects of the research output data, including publication metadata, citation patterns, and textual content.

One of the project's key strengths lies in its ability to analyze research output across multiple dimensions. We examine temporal trends to understand how research productivity and impact have evolved over the past two decades. This analysis reveals important patterns in publication volume, citation accumulation, and research focus areas. At the institutional level, we assess the productivity and impact of different RDCs, identifying centers of excellence and understanding the factors that contribute to their success.

The project also delves into author-level analysis, identifying prolific researchers and understanding their contribution patterns. This aspect of the analysis helps in recognizing key contributors to the field and understanding collaboration patterns. Additionally, we conduct venue-level analysis to assess the impact of different publication outlets and their role in disseminating research findings.

A particularly innovative aspect of the project is its use of advanced text analysis techniques. Through topic modeling and semantic analysis of research titles, we identify emerging research themes and track their evolution over time. This analysis provides valuable insights into the changing landscape of research priorities and interests within the FSRDC network.

The project's findings have significant implications for research policy, institutional strategy, and individual career development. By understanding the patterns and factors that contribute to research impact, stakeholders can make more informed decisions about resource allocation, collaboration opportunities, and research direction. The project's comprehensive approach and detailed analysis provide a solid foundation for evidence-based decision-making in the academic research ecosystem.

\subsection{EDA Analysis Results and Visualizations}
We performed a comprehensive exploratory analysis of 2,698 research outputs from FSRDC centers. Below is a high-level synthesis of the main findings:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Publication Volume \& Growth}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Total outputs rose from almost zero in 2000 to a peak of approximately 260 publications per year by 2021–2022, before declining in 2024–2025 (partial data).
      \item The top 10 RDCs by sheer volume are Michigan, Boston, Chicago, Triangle, Baruch, Atlanta, Fed Board, Texas, Minnesota, and UCLA, together accounting for the majority of outputs.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Author Productivity}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Among all authors, John Haltiwanger leads with 74 publications, followed by Nathan Goldschlag (55), Lucia Foster (52), and several others in the 30–45 range.
      \item A histogram of author counts shows most papers are single- or small-team efforts, with few large collaborations.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Output Types \& Diversification}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Journal articles (MI) dominate the portfolio (\(>90\%\) of outputs), but the share of reports (RE) has steadily grown since 2005.
      \item Other categories—book chapters, dissertations, working papers, data sets—remain niche (\(<5\text{--}10\) papers/year).
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Citation Distribution \& Skew}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Citation counts are extremely right-skewed: median = 25, mean \(\approx 111\), 99th percentile \(\approx 1{,}475\), maximum = 10{,}952.
      \item Over 75\% of papers have \(\le88\) citations, and a handful of "blockbusters" drive the heavy tail.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Citations Over Time}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Early publications (pre-2010) enjoy higher mean/median citations, while recent years show lower per-paper citations due to citation lag.
      \item Publication volume and per-paper citations are inversely related over time: as output volume soared, mean/median citations per paper declined.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{RDC-Level Impact}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Washington RDC achieves the highest median citations per paper (103), followed by USC (57.5) and Triangle (49).
      \item High-volume centers like Michigan and Boston show lower medians (28–42), reflecting broader citation variability.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Venue-Level Impact}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Top venues by median citation include British Journal of Pharmacology (256), QJE (248), Applied Geography (248), and Journal of Finance (244).
      \item This list spans biomedical, economics, engineering, and astrophysics outlets, underscoring interdisciplinary reach.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Citation Velocity}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item When adjusted for age, certain recent works (e.g., the SciPy 1.0 paper) exhibit exceptionally high citations per year (\(>100/\text{year}\)), marking them as "fast risers."
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Inter-Variable Correlations}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The only notable numeric correlation is a negative link between citations and publication year (\(r\approx -0.21\)), reflecting time-to-accumulate effects.
      \item Other metadata fields (month, volume, issue, pages) show negligible correlations with citation impact.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{Conclusion}
FSRDC outputs have grown dramatically over 25 years, concentrated in journal articles and a handful of prolific authors and centers. Citation impact follows a classic long-tail pattern: most works receive modest attention, while a small subset achieves extraordinary influence. Venue choice, publication timing, and citation velocity reveal strategic levers for maximizing research visibility.


\section{Using Python for Data Science Applications}


\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Overview and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)}\\
    Through detailed exploratory analysis, we observed the following major insights from the combined dataset of research outputs:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Publication Trends:}  
        Research activity significantly increased from 2000 to 2023, with clear peaks in recent years. RDCs such as Michigan, Boston, Chicago, and Triangle are notably productive, indicating strong institutional support and collaborative environments.
      \item \textbf{Author Productivity:}  
        Key prolific authors identified include John Haltiwanger, Nathan Goldschlag, Lucia Foster, and Javier Miranda. These authors significantly contributed to the dataset, highlighting influential research leaders.
      \item \textbf{Citation Analysis:}  
        Citation distributions showed heavy skewness with most publications having low citation counts, while a small subset had exceptionally high citations (e.g., top-cited papers with thousands of citations). Citation analysis by RDC revealed institutions like Washington, USC, and Berkeley excel in producing highly cited research. Journal venues such as \textit{The Quarterly Journal of Economics}, \textit{Journal of Econometrics}, and \textit{Journal of Financial Economics} consistently published highly impactful work.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Regression and Classification Modeling Insights}\\
    Initial attempts at using regression (predicting citation counts directly) showed limited effectiveness due to inherent variability and outlier effects in citations, making it challenging to model accurately.

    Thus, the problem was reframed as a binary classification (high vs.\ low citation counts):
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Baseline Logistic Regression:} Achieved moderate performance, suggesting some predictability in citation popularity based on publication metadata.
      \item \textbf{Advanced Models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks):} Improved accuracy significantly, with XGBoost delivering the strongest performance (Accuracy: 78\%, ROC-AUC: 86\%). This indicates that complex nonlinear relationships exist between metadata (publication type, year, RDC) and citation outcomes.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Insights}\\
    PCA analysis showed clear dimensional structure in the dataset. Although the first two principal components explained limited variance (around 40\%), they provided useful clustering signals, suggesting latent patterns or groups within publication attributes. Visualization highlighted distinct clusters, particularly when considering RDC and Output Type combinations.

  \item \textbf{Clustering Insights}\\
    Three distinct clustering methodologies were employed:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{K-Means Clustering:} Identified distinct groups based on publication metadata, providing insights into groups with inherently high or low citation potentials.
      \item \textbf{Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative):} Revealed hierarchical relationships and substructures within publications, further detailing potential strategic groups for targeted analysis or investment.
      \item \textbf{DBSCAN:} Identified robust clusters and effectively managed noise, indicating strong intrinsic grouping structures tied to institutional attributes and publication venues.
    \end{itemize}
    The clusters consistently revealed that certain RDCs and output types naturally group together, reflecting common research themes or shared citation trajectories.

  \item \textbf{Advanced NLP Methods}\\
    Multiple text-based methods revealed deep insights from the output titles:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{TF-IDF Analysis:} Highlighted key terms such as "economic," "market," and "analysis," suggesting dominant economic and market-oriented research topics.
      \item \textbf{LDA Topic Modeling:} Successfully identified coherent thematic groups such as:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Economic Policy \& Markets
          \item Health \& Medical Research
          \item Machine Learning \& AI
          \item Financial \& Investment Analysis
